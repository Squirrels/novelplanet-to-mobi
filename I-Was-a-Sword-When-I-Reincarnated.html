		<p>This is the end of chapter 1. There will be a short delay as I compile and revise the entirety of chapter 1. I should upload the full version soon. Though this is mostly for new readers, not readers who’ve read all the parts already. The prologue and chapter 1 are approximately 30% of the book. This means, at this rate, I should be done in about three months. So my goal is to be done before school starts.</p>
<p>Oh! And for those of you going to Anime Expo in LA, who knows, you might see me there!</p>
<hr>
<p class="p1">『Okay, then what should I do now?』</p>
<p class="p1">I had planned to go back to the pedestal after I was done fighting, but…</p>
<p class="p1">The sun was still high up in the sky.</p>
<p class="p1">And the mysterious forest was right in front of me.</p>
<p class="p1">The forest area that surrounded Area 5.</p>
<p class="p1">I thought it was too early to investigate, but…</p>
<p class="p1">『What should I do?』</p>
<p class="p1">I’m not damaged, and I have time. It’s okay to go there, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="p1">『I’m already all the way here and going back without doing anything would be wasteful.』</p>
<p class="p1">I spontaneously decided to explore the outer portion of the Area.</p>
<p class="p1">I examined my situation before suddenly flying into the forest.</p>
<p class="p1">I used Sense Danger and Sense Heat.</p>
<p class="p1">『Hmm, is nothing there…?』</p>
<p class="p1">It seemed like there were lots of animals but nearly no demonic beasts.</p>
<p class="p1">There were goblins at least, but…they’re not worth chasing around.</p>
<p class="p1">『The only demonic beasts here are small fries.』</p>
<p class="p1">This place did give me an Area 6 feel, so I kept on guard on the off chance that any mythical creatures that appeared.</p>
<p class="p1">But it wasn’t any different from Area 1.</p>
<p class="p1">It felt like this was all pointless.</p>
<p class="p1">『Geez, I got all excited for no reason.』</p>
<p class="p1">I felt stupid for being so on guard and ready to run away.</p>
<p class="p1">『That’s enough for now. I’m going to go back.』</p>
<p class="p1">I flew through the air with the Telekinetic Catapult.</p>
<p class="p1">Below me was a normal forest. I couldn’t feel any traces of any large demonic beasts.</p>
<p class="p1">『Oh, open place found.』</p>
<p class="p1">I saw an area bereft of trees in the middle of the forest.</p>
<p class="p1">I changed the direction I was going with Telekinesis and landed in the meadow.</p>
<p class="p1">And——I stuck my blade in there.</p>
<p class="p1">『Great, landing successful!』</p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes when I use the Telekinetic Catapult Movement Technique, my body tilts and I end up landing hilt first or crashing side first into the ground.</p>
<p class="p1">When that happens, it doesn’t do any damage to me, but they are failed landings.</p>
<p class="p1">And the times when I sink my blade into the ground are successful landings. It somehow made me feel better.</p>
<p class="p1">It was easy to use Telekinesis right before landing to land cleanly. But whether I landed successfully or not, for the fun of it I usually let gravity take over as I fell. It was one of the few forms of entertainment I had besides hunting.</p>
<p class="p1">The ground on my blade felt like clay. I could feel the clay sticking wetly onto my blade.</p>
<p class="p1">『Okay, I should go fly again… Huh?』</p>
<p class="p1">My body wasn’t moving.</p>
<p class="p1">Was the clay-like dirt sticking to me more than I thought?</p>
<p class="p1">I activated Telekinesis with a little more force.</p>
<p class="p1">『N-no way… Telekinesis won’t activate?』</p>
<p class="p1">At the same time that Telekinesis activated, it was forceably canceled.</p>
<p class="p1">With things like this, I needed to use all of my strength.</p>
<p class="p1">I put in all the mana I possible could and used Telekinesis.</p>
<p class="p1">Fwwwp.</p>
<p class="p1">The soft sound of steam escaping.</p>
<p class="p1">And nothing happened.</p>
<p class="p1">『Damn, is it impossible?』</p>
<p class="p1">I could tell that my mana was being absorbed by the ground.</p>
<p class="p1">The huge amount of mana I used disappeared almost instantly.</p>
<p class="p1">『Then how about this?』</p>
<p class="p1">I used a skill.</p>
<p class="p1">My plan was to use Vibration Fang to shake my blade and make some space between my blade and the earth.</p>
<p class="p1">But Vibration Fang didn’t activate either.</p>
<p class="p1">Then what if I shoot Air Missile from my blade and use the air pressure to send me flying?</p>
<p class="p1">No activation whatsoever.</p>
<p class="p1">I’ll send myself flying from the ground with fire magic!</p>
<p class="p1">No, it did not activate.</p>
<p class="p1">『Ah…what the heck~』</p>
<p class="p1">I stopped trying to escape for now and looked around the area.</p>
<p class="p1">But the demonic beasts from the plains must not enter the forest because of this mana absorption. The stronger the demonic beast, the more important mana was to their daily activities, so if they come into this forest carelessly, they might not even be able to move. Like me.</p>
<p class="p1">『My only solace is that I don’t feel hunger…』</p>
<p class="p1">I did a few more tests later, but none of my skills that could move me activated.</p>
<p class="p1">It wasn’t absorbing the mana from my blade, so as long as I didn’t use skills for no reason, I wouldn’t be stuck in here for lack of ability.</p>
<p class="p1">There was no major problem with my use of the mana in my blade to see.</p>
<p class="p1">But something dawned on me after a few hours passed.</p>
<p class="p1">『My MP isn’t recovering at all.』</p>
<p class="p1">It must be because the mana in the air here is thin. My MP didn’t recover on its own.</p>

        </div>
        
<p class="p1">I still had over half of it left, but it seemed best to not waste it.</p>
<p class="p1">This is dangerous. There was now no way for me to get free by myself.</p>
<p class="p1">Ah, what do I do…</p>
<p class="p1">Four days passed like that. Of course, nothing changed.</p>
<p class="p1">I spent the first day looking for a skill that could help me escape, but I immediately reached an unsatisfactory conclusion.</p>
<p class="p1">Because I couldn’t emit any mana to the outside, I also couldn’t use attack-type skills, magic, and Telepathy. (tn: Might be a translation mistake? Why is it Telepathy?)</p>
<p class="p1">My only hopes were that either something would pass by me and pull me out out of curiosity or a natural disaster would send me flying.</p>
<p class="p1">The best outcome would be that a human pulls me out.</p>
<p class="p1">Ten days passed with me stuck in the ground. I am sorry. I was unable to understand reality. Now I don’t care if my wielder isn’t a human. I apologize to all the goblins that I killed. I will no longer call you all experience points. So please, I beg of you, someone save me. If you pull me out of the ground, I will follow you for the rest of my life. Be it a goblin or a zombie, anything is fine. Please.</p>
<p class="p1">One month later. Aah, anyone is fine so pick me up. I’m begging you! I’m a high caliber sword. I’m basically a magic sword. I’m saying there aren’t that many swords that can think and move on their own. I can even cook and I have skills. Seriously. If you want, I can also use points to raise their levels. Here, watch. I can get Cooking 10 just like this.</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;Leveled up to Cooking 10. Bonus added to status and the cooking skill&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;New title added as a class bonus&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">I also have dismantle. It’s conveient. I can level this one up too. Now, level 10!</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;Leveled up to Dismantle 10. Bonus added to status and the Dismantle skill&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">I also have Appraisal. I can level this one up as well. I increased it by one level. Isn’t that awesome? My attack is high too. And my Sword Wielding and Aurablade are both at level 7. I’ll increase my magic skills too. I made fire magic 10! How’s that?</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;Fire Magic 10 acquired. Blaze Magic 1 added to skills&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">You see! Even better than I thought. Next are my stat boosting skills!</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;Wielder Stat Boost [Medium] acquired&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">Now I can make my wielder way stronger. How’s that? Picking me up isn’t such a bad idea, now is it? And this skill is———.</p>
<p class="p1">“——…Ack!”</p>
<p class="p1">Ahh, I was so starved for human interaction that I had an auditory hallucination. This may be the end for me.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hey——! …There’s a——ack!”</p>
<p class="p1">Huh? Was that really a hallucination?</p>
<p class="p1">Thump thump thump thump!</p>
<p class="p1">I could feel slight vibrations from the ground.</p>
<p class="p1">What could that sound me?</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s still——this way——.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh…shit! What the——.”</p>
<p class="p1">Those were definitely human voices!</p>
<p class="p1">All right, humans are here!</p>
<p class="p1">Thank you God!</p>
<p class="p1">Come on, I’m over here! There’s a sword stuck in the ground right here. Don’t I look just like a legendary sword? So pick me up! Pu-ree-ju!</p>
<p class="p1">Thump thump thump thump!</p>
<p class="p1">The vibrations were coming from a wagon’s wheels.</p>
<p class="p1">A covered wagon appeared in the forest.</p>
<p class="p1">Isn’t it going too fast? If it turns a corner at that speed, it’ll——.</p>
<p class="p1">B-b-boom!</p>
<p class="p1">Uwah! Are the people inside it okay? But why were they in such a hurry? It seemed like something was chasing them.</p>
<p class="p1">Because I couldn’t even use Telepathy, all I could do was watch.</p>
<p class="p1">As I was worrying about the people inside the wagon, some people crawled out of it.</p>
<p class="p1">Phew, they’re all safe.</p>
<p class="p1">Are they merchants? They didn’t look like warriors, but they didn’t look like ordinary people either. They had cloth wrapped around their heads and well-made clothes on. The slightly grubby overcoats must be from their long travels.</p>
<p class="p1">A short man that looked like a subordinate came out with a couple of others.</p>
<p class="p1">The people the subordinate brought with him looked…how should I put it…awful.</p>
<p class="p1">They had on obviously unwashed, ragged cloth tied onto their bodies with string; it couldn’t even be called clothes. Their hair was in a mess and on their necks were big collars.</p>
<p class="p1">『They must be slaves. Are there slaves in this world as well?』</p>
<p class="p1">“Hey, you and the slaves pick up the bags!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yes sir, I’ll tell them to right away! Hurry up and do what he said! Pick up the bags!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Uuuu…”</p>
<p class="p1">“Aahhh…”</p>
<p class="p1">“Hurry up, you retards!”</p>
<p class="p1">Uwah. He’s trash. Human trash.</p>
<p class="p1">The short man had the slaves pick up the heavy bags by whipping them.</p>
<p class="p1">It didn’t sit right with me to just watch.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hurry! It-it’s coming!”</p>
<p class="p1">It? What in the world is chasing them?</p>
<p class="p1">The thing that made them hurry so much appeared.</p>
<p class="p1">“Heeeek! It’s here!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Grrrrrr.”</p>
<p class="p1">It was a two-headed bear, a demonic beast.</p>

<hr>
<p class="p1">Fran was surprised at the increase in her physical abilities that happened because she equipped me.</p>
<p class="p1">Fran was taken aback after we left the forest in less than thirty minutes.</p>
<p class="p1">“Amazing. Master is amazing.”</p>
<p class="p1">『Hahaha. Aren’t I?』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">『Then what shall we do now? Do you have a destination in mind?』</p>
<p class="p1">“Uuun, there’s a city.”</p>
<p class="p1">『Near here?』</p>
<p class="p1">“That way.”</p>
<p class="p1">『So it’s that way but…do you know how far away it is?』</p>
<p class="p1">“Not really?”</p>
<p class="p1">Anyway, it seemed that she had heard by chance that the slave traders were taking them to the east. Because Fran had the Directional Sense skill, she was able to tell what direction she was going. And that is how the vague answer of ‘That way’ came about.</p>
<p class="p1">『Then let’s go that way.』</p>
<p class="p1">And so, we took off with the slight feeling that our journey was taking off.</p>
<p class="p1">I realized while on the way to the city that because my Appraisal level went up, there was a little something added to my status window.</p>
<p class="p1">I gained the mysterious title, Mana Conductivity.</p>
<p class="p1">I asked Fran about it, but she didn’t know.</p>
<p class="p1">Does it increase my mana conducting efficiency? What does it do?</p>
<p class="p1">It also says that I’m an “A” but I had no way of knowing if that was good or bad.</p>
<p class="p1">Next, the way status displayed my skills changed.</p>
<p class="p1">I was able to categorize skills based on their type. So it became a little easier to look at my skills.</p>
<p class="p1">And it looked like, because I maxed out Fire Magic, I gained a bonus line in my status.</p>
<p class="p1">It was Superior Fire Skill.</p>
<p class="p1">After reaching level 10, the bonus changed a normal skill into a special, Superior one. It looked like it was excluded from Set Skills and only I was able to use it<span class="s1">—I couldn’t share it with Fran.</span></p>
<p class="p3">If I use ten or more Self-Evolution Points, I’ll need to choose how I use them carefully.</p>
<p class="p1">I also told Fran about myself while we were on the road. I didn’t have anything to hide from her. I’ll have to keep my mouth shut to hide this from others, though.</p>
<p class="p1">I told her about the fact that I used to be a human, that I grow by absorbing magic crystals, that I could share skills and raise her stats because she was my wielder, and more.</p>
<p class="p1">“Magic crystals…”</p>
<p class="p1">『That’s right. Well, it hasn’t been that long since I ranked up, so it’ll take a while.』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">『Ah, hey, what are you doing?』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">Clink clink.</p>
<p class="p1">Fran took the magic crystal from a Fanged Rat she found along the way and pressed it hard against my blade. She probably wanted me to absorb it. Though the way she was doing it was violent.</p>
<p class="p1">『Wait! I need to cut it! Put it against the edge!』</p>
<p class="p1">“Like this?”</p>
<p class="p1">『Yeah, exactly.』</p>
<p class="p1">“You really absorbed it.”</p>
<p class="p1">『That’s how I get stronger. We can sell their loot, so let’s also hunt a lot of demonic beasts.』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un. Okay.”</p>
<p class="p1">And after that, I tested out Telepathy. Since I was using it for the first time with Fran, there was still a lot of things I didn’t know.</p>
<p class="p1">It seemed like it created an area that made two-way communication possible. If I limited the skill to only connect to Fran, then I was able to talk privately with her. Also, I would likely be able to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>increase the range to let me talk to everyone in an area. We tested it out on a rabbit that Fran caught, and both Fran and the rabbit could hear my voice through Telepathy.</p>
<p class="p1">But Fran’s Telepathy didn’t reach the rabbit. It was probably so that others couldn’t use Telekinesis to communicate while excluding me. It was a skill meant to allow me to communicate with anyone from anywhere.</p>
<p class="p1">Our journey was progressing without a hitch.</p>
<p class="p1">The plains must have been a special environment because outside of the forest, there were no particularly strong demonic beasts. They were about the same as those in Area 2.</p>
<p class="p1">I did the cooking.</p>
<p class="p1">Because, back when I was going crazy, I improved my Cooking skill. I was able to use cooking tools without a problem because of Telekinesis, and I was also able to use ingredients. It was the easiest thing in the world for a sword like me to slice and peel things. I was easily able to make fire or water with magic.</p>
<p class="p1">The ingredients were the demonic beasts I had kept in my Dimensional Storage. I was able to tell which demonic beasts were edible, maybe thanks to the Cooking skill.</p>
<p class="p1">Fran could probably cook as well because she had the same skills as me, but…</p>
<p class="p1">I wanted to be in charge of the cooking. Because it was my duty as a guardian.</p>
<p class="p1">As a precaution, I equipped the skills Poison Resistance, Enhanced Absorption, Enhanced Digestion, Gluttony, and other skills like that. Gluttony was a skill that let the user gain strength from food after it’s absorbed. I had no way of knowing how much of an effect it would have, but it couldn’t hurt to have it equipped.</p>
<p class="p1">Fran’s status had changed to become like this. The shared skills we had in common didn’t show up.</p>
<p class="p1">Name: Fran Age: 12 years old</p>
<p class="p1">Race: Beastfolk. Black Cat</p>
<p class="p1">Job: None</p>
<p class="p1">Status: Slave</p>
<p class="p1">Lv: 3</p>
<p class="p1">HP: 39 MP: 25 Strength: 24 Agility: 46</p>
<p class="p1">Skills: Sword Wielding 1, Night Vision, Ability to Skin Prey, Directional Sense</p>
<p class="p1">Titles: Dismantling Master, Skill Collector, Flame Arts User, Cooking Master</p>
<p class="p1">Her status was overwhelmingly stronger than the goblins.</p>
<p class="p1">She was about equal to the demonic beasts in Area 3 or the Evil Goblins.</p>
<p class="p1">Thanks to Wielder Status Boost [small] that I acquired a while ago, each of her stats went up because of skills like Strength Boost [small].</p>
<p class="p1">I thought this ability was a cheat when she was only level 3. She would have no problem beating any low-rank monsters.</p>
<p class="p1">It’ll probably change based on the set skills, but I decided to always keep Sword Wielding, Fire Magic, and status boosting skills set.I also got used to changing the Set Skills. I could probably even change the Set Skills even during combat.</p>
<p class="p1">The problem was money.</p>
<p class="p1">I was told that the currency in this world is commonly called gold. But we got two silver coins and twenty-four copper coins from the slave trader. All together, it was two hundred twenty-four gold. I couldn’t tell if it was enough for a night at an inn or not; this conundrum could not be solved.</p>
<p class="p1">I called it a conundrum because Fran didn’t know the current prices in society. She probably only had a rough idea.</p>
<p class="p1">First, we needed to make money. So we can buy armor or the necessities for exploring.</p>
<p class="p1">I had a solution for now. The corpses of the demonic beasts I had put in my Dimensional Storage.</p>
<p class="p1">According to Fran, selling the loot from demonic beasts is explorers’ main source of income. I will likely make at least some money by selling the loot in my storage.</p>
<p class="p1">So, before storing them, I needed to dismantle them and sort out what loot was sellable.</p>
<p class="p1">But if a girl like Fran carried around the high rank demonic beasts’ loot, she might attract attention, so I planned to sell the less strong monsters’ loot first.</p>
<p class="p1">Well, this was all stuff I could figure out when we arrived at the city though.</p>
<p class="p1">『Great. That’s settled.』</p>
<p class="p1">We were currently camping out. Fran was dismantling the loot.</p>
<p class="p1">I realized this just a moment ago, but after being registered as my wielder, Fran had access to our shared skills even when I moved away from her. Her status boosts also stayed in effect. Even if I wasn’t right next to her, Fran could still use the Dismantle skill.</p>
<p class="p1">Fran, with a knife in one hand, was diligently dismantling the demonic beast’s corpse that she had laid down on the ground.</p>
<p class="p1">I was creating an odor-nullifying barrier to stop any demonic beasts from smelling the blood and coming here. Fran also put up a barrier herself. It seemed like she was getting skilled with magic skills in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p class="p1">I was preparing a meal for Fran. I made a stew with the pot and ingredients from the slave traders’ wagon and meat from the demonic beasts. I also added in the medicinal plants she had picked along the way so it was even perfectly nutritious. In addition, because of my Cooking 10, it tasted perfect<span class="s1">——I mean, it should taste perfect. It really was a shame that I couldn’t taste it.</span></p>
<p class="p3">We’ll likely share the work like this in the future, more or less.</p>
<p class="p3">With me cooking and keeping watch, and Fran being in charge of dismantling.</p>
<p class="p3">I ate the magic crystals, and Fran would either sell or eat everything besides that.</p>
<p class="p1">『Fran, all done.』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">『And of course, wash your hands.』</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"> “</span>——Aqua Create.”</p>
<p class="p3">Fran washed her hands with the water she created. Mana-wise, this was no problem.</p>
<p class="p1">She could use my MP pool, so she could make as much water as she wanted without it being a problem.</p>
<p class="p1">『Are you finished dismantling?』</p>
<p class="p1">“More or less. But I couldn’t do that one.”</p>
<p class="p1">『Ahh, the tortoise.』</p>
<p class="p1">At the opposite end of Fran’s gaze was the Blast Turtle’s conspicuous corpse. Even with a dismantling skill of 10, it was impossible to cut through that hard shell with an ordinary knife.</p>
<p class="p1">Well, it is an evolved demonic beast, so it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p class="p1">Yesterday, she also couldn’t dismantle the Tyrant Saber-toothed Tiger. Mostly because of the tools.</p>
<p class="p1">『Looks like that’s up to me today as well.』</p>
<p class="p1">“Please.”</p>
<p class="p1">『Yeah. Leave it to me. Fran, eat.』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un. Thanks.”</p>
<p class="p1">I should hurry and dismantle it before Fran’s done.</p>
<p class="p1">It was three days after I met Fran.</p>
<p class="p1">We continued to walk with the city as our destination.</p>
<p class="p1">I was wrapped up in the wagon’s cover to not be noticed by others, and Fran kept me on her back. Because there was no excuse we could give if somebody saw me floating in the air.</p>
<p class="p1">『Hey, can we enter the city without a problem?』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un?”</p>
<p class="p1">『I mean, is there an entry toll or some kind of identification card that we need?』</p>
<p class="p1">“Don’t know.”</p>
<p class="p1">Fran shook her head from side to side. Cute<span class="s1">——.</span></p>
<p class="p3">No, no. This wasn’t the time for that.</p>
<p class="p3">Fran had probably never gone through the entry procedures of entering a city because she was a slave. And thus, we had almost no information.</p>
<p class="p1">『We might be able to gain some more information if there was someone to ask.』</p>
<p class="p1">For the past three days of our journey, we had yet to find even a trace of other people.</p>
<p class="p1">But why was that? There weren’t any peddlers or travelers, let alone thieves.</p>
<p class="p1">“Because this isn’t a highway.”</p>
<p class="p1">『Huh? What do you mean?』</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"> “</span>This is a side road split off from the highway.”</p>
<p class="p3">The slave traders probably crossed through that dangerous area full of demonic beasts to save some time.</p>
<p class="p3">And how unfortunate for them to meet their demise after being attacked.</p>
<p class="p3">If only they hadn’t dragged the slaves along with them.</p>
<p class="p1">『Huh? There’re highways?』</p>
<p class="p1">Though there was no way there would be a lot of people in that field infested with demonic beasts.</p>
<p class="p1">『Where is it?』</p>
<p class="p1">“It’ll show up soon if I keep going.”</p>
<p class="p1">『That’d be great.』</p>
<p class="p1">“It’ll be okay. Probably.”</p>
<p class="p1">And four hours passed.</p>
<p class="p1">During that time, we walked carefree, hunting rabbit-like animals or talking about what to spend Self-Evolution Points on next.</p>
<p class="p1">We discussed a variety of options, from increasing our skill levels to getting status boosting skills, but in the end we decided to acquire Nullify Senses and and Memory Increase .</p>
<p class="p1">Nullify Senses, as its name suggests, is a skill that blocks my target from sensing anything. According to Fran, talking swords are rare. So I acquired the skill to use in case of a difficult encounter.</p>
<p class="p1">Memory Increase  is a useful skill that increases the number of Set Skills I can have. Because one of our strong points was the diversity of our skills, increasing the number of skills we could set directly improved our combat ability. I needed to acquire it.</p>
<p class="p1">We continued talking about this looking good and that looking good until we discovered the long-awaited highway.</p>
<p class="p1">『Yes, it’s the road!』</p>
<p class="p1">It was a slightly better road than the beasts’ road that was just a path with the grass pulled out. But due to constant traffic, the ground was imprinted with wheel marks. That was without a doubt a road.</p>
<p class="p1">Thanks to Fran’s Directional Sense, we continued to walk towards the city.</p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, life form detected.”</p>
<p class="p1">『It doesn’t seem like a human.』</p>
<p class="p1">We were able to perceive the size and movements of our targets with the Sense Traces skill. I could tell that they were probably goblins, as I had sensed them multiple times before.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Fran Second Picture 239</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b> </b>“Get them?”</p>
<p class="p1">『For now, anyway. I don’t know if we can sell their loot, but I can absorb their magic crystals.』</p>
<p class="p1">“Okay.”</p>
<p class="p1">Fran nodded her head, and she ran off the highway.</p>
<p class="p1">Because I already equipped combat boosting skills, she ran between the trees like the wind.</p>
<p class="p1">“They’re there.”</p>
<p class="p1">The goblins hid themselves in the forest that was at the edge of the highway. They were likely waiting for someone to come along the road.</p>
<p class="p1">There were three of them.</p>
<p class="p1">Fran crept up silently behind the goblins and attacked them.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hup.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Keek?”</p>
<p class="p1">The one that Fran had slashed stood unsteadily on its feet then collapsed.</p>
<p class="p1">“Haagh!”</p>
<p class="p1">She felled the two remaining goblins with the sword after taking it out of the goblin’s corpse. She had become faster with her techniques because she had grown more accustomed to the skills.</p>
<p class="p1">The goblins likely hadn’t even realized anything was wrong with their bodies.</p>
<p class="p1">Because the fight was over before the first goblin’s body had even hit the ground.</p>
<p class="p1">“Master, the rest is yours.”</p>
<p class="p1">『Yeah, leave it to me.』</p>
<p class="p1">After I absorbed their magic crystals, I cut off the goblins’ horns, the only usable loot on them. Fran told me that she had heard that once.</p>
<p class="p1">It was dangerous to leave the corpses near the highway as they could attract large demonic beasts, so I put them in my Dimensional Storage.</p>
<p class="p1">“Master, there’re goblins over there.”</p>
<p class="p1">『More of them?』</p>
<p class="p1">“What shall we do?”</p>
<p class="p1">『We have to go that way anyway, so want to get rid of them?』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">Fran once again ran at them. But once she ran forward, a completely unexpected sight entered our vision.</p>
<p class="p1">“Shit! Go away, you damn goblins!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Kikiki.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Gururuah.”</p>
<p class="p1">A wagon was being attacked by the goblins.</p>
<p class="p1">There were six of them. While there appeared to only be one person on the wagon.</p>
<p class="p1">『The goblins again, really?』</p>
<p class="p1">“I want to help.”</p>
<p class="p1">『Got it. Do your best.』</p>
<p class="p1">She once again launched a silent sneak attack from behind.</p>
<p class="p1">She sliced three of them with Sword Technique: Triple Thrust. Though it was weak as a swift trio of stabs would be expected to be, it was more than enough against the goblins.</p>
<p class="p1">“I-I’m saved!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Kiii!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Shut up.”</p>
<p class="p1">The goblins sensed the threat that Fran’s sudden appearance posed. But Fran cut them down without mercy.</p>
<p class="p1">The sole remaining goblin turned to run away, but Fran threw me at it, killing it.</p>
<p class="p1">Thanks to the Throwing skill, I had cut clean through its stomach. I had planned on secretly changing my trajectory if the throw was off, but there was no need for that.</p>
<p class="p1">“Th-thank you, young lady. You saved me.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">“But you sure are strong. Are you here by yourself?”</p>
<p class="p1">“……”</p>
<p class="p1">“No, you don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to.”</p>
<p class="p1">Though Fran was simply not talkative, he must have mistaken her behavior for her not wanting to talk.</p>
<p class="p1">The truth was, I was glad that she didn’t rashly give him information. Deciding to allow this misunderstanding about Fran to stand, I gave Fran instructions with Telepathy.</p>
<p class="p1">‘Okay.’</p>
<p class="p1">“Um, if it’s okay with you, would you like to ride on my wagon? You’re going to Alessa, right?”</p>
<p class="p1">It seemed that the name of our destination is Alessa.</p>
<p class="p1">But this man; he looked weak, but he wasn’t a fool.</p>
<p class="p1">He may have offered a ride to his savior, Fran, out of the goodness of his heart to repay her for saving him from the goblins, but he also wanted her to act as his escort.</p>
<p class="p1">We needed information anyway, so we decided to take up his offer. But of course, the debt for saving his life wasn’t that cheap.</p>
<p class="p1">I told Fran what to say.</p>
<p class="p1">“We’ll escort you up to the town.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, yeah, please do.”</p>
<p class="p1">Hmph. There was a bitter smile on his face.</p>
<p class="p1">“We will escort you for free in exchange for the information we want.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Hahahaha. This is fun. I like it! Get on.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m Randel. And you?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Fran.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Then I hope our travels go well, Fran-san.”</p>
<p class="p1">We didn’t forget to collect the goblins’ horns before we left.</p>
<p class="p1">We asked the man a question immediately. Well, it was Fran who asked him, though.</p>
<p class="p1">“Can I sell goblin horns?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Goblin horns are extremely cheap. They can act as a mana catalyst, but their quality’s the absolute worst.”</p>
<p class="p1">I see. So gathering them wasn’t worth it.</p>
<p class="p1">But Randel wasn’t done talking yet.</p>
<p class="p1">“But since the Adventurer’s Guild encourages destroying any Demon race monsters as soon as they’re found, they can fetch a decent price there.”</p>
<p class="p1">Appraisal also encouraged me to destroy them on sight.</p>
<p class="p1">Come to think of it, it’s a really arbitrary description.</p>
<p class="p1">It clearly had a massive grudge against the goblins. But who wrote the description in the first place? A god? Then it was probably a god that got rid of the grim reaper. Because the contents were so obviously biased.</p>
<p class="p1">The goblins might even feel the same way about humans, that humans are evil.</p>
<p class="p1">Well, even so, I didn’t have any complaints. Since I already killed them. If the description had said, “Though they have menacing faces, they are actually kind,” then I’d definitely feel guilty. But because it said the goblins are evil, I felt like I did nothing wrong. Instead, hunting them became a matter of course.</p>
<p class="p1">For all I know, that was the descritpion writer’s intent. Or maybe it was trying to get me to hunt the Demon race monsters.</p>
<p class="p1">Could the one who wrote the description really be a god? And that connects to the man’s voice I heard when I reincarnated into this world. Could that have been a god? If that was the case, then he seemed like a good person. At the very least, it didn’t sound like he was trying to manipulate me. No, wait, could that have been his plan? Wait, wait, but…</p>
<p class="p1">Ah, stop, stop. Thinking about this while I have no information is useless. Well, it’s not like this lack of information is doing me any harm, so I should stop thinking about it so hard.</p>
<p class="p1">“Your skill in taking down those Threat Level G goblins was superb.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Danger Level?”</p>
<p class="p1">It was the first time I’d heard that. Based on the context, is it a term used to indicate a demonic beast’s strength or rank?</p>
<p class="p1">“You don’t know what that is?”</p>
<p class="p1">After that, Randel explained what Threat Levels are. Well, since we didn’t have anything else to talk about, he explained in detail.</p>
<p class="p4">Adventurer Ranks</p>
<p class="p4">G: Rookies; treated like temps. Not yet true adventurers.</p>
<p class="p4">F: Newcomers; receive training. Treated like adventurers for the time being.</p>
<p class="p4">E: Does work for him or herself. Okay to proclaim oneself to be an adventurer.</p>
<p class="p4">D: Mid-tier adventurers. Can be party leaders.</p>
<p class="p4">C: Veterans. Appear superhuman to common people.</p>
<p class="p4">B: Elites. Not unusual for the strongest adventurer in a small guild to be this rank.</p>
<p class="p4">A: Heros; there are only a few in each country. Even the common people know their names. Famous to the point of being praised by bards.</p>
<p class="p4">S: Mythical. There are only eight in the world. Even kings bow their heads to them, and they can even give commands to guild leaders.</p>
<p class="p4">Demonic Beast Threat Levels</p>
<p class="p4">G: Small fries; an adult man can beat them. Goblin, Fanged Rat.</p>
<p class="p4">F: Able to destroy caravans and guards. Large Brown Bear, Five-Headed Wolf.</p>
<p class="p4">E: Able to destroy villages. Lesser Wyvern, Ogre.</p>
<p class="p4">D: Able to destroy towns. Lesser Hydra, Blast Tortoise.</p>
<p class="p4">C: Able to destroy large towns. Knights must mobilize right away. Tyrant Saber-Toothed Tiger, Low-ranked Demon.</p>
<p class="p4">B: Able to destroy nations. Crisis requiring mobilization of all a nation’s troops. High-ranked Demon, High-ranked Dragon, King-tier Giant.</p>
<p class="p4">A: Able to destroy continents. Demon King, King-tier Dragon, Lich.</p>
<p class="p4">S: Global catastrophe; demonic beasts of myths. Fenrir, God-tier Dragon.</p>
<p class="p1">Adventurer Ranks and Threat Levels are matched so that parties of corresponding ranks can defeat a demonic beast of that level. Or adventurers can solo kill demonic beasts that are one Threat Level lower than the adventurer’s rank.</p>
<p class="p1">Goblins were at the lowest level. But when more than five of them horde together into a mob, the Threat Level increases to F.</p>
<p class="p1">So that meant, since Fran just defeated the goblin mob alone, she was at least Adventurer Rank E.</p>
<p class="p1">“But this is the first time I’ve ever been attacked by a goblin mob on a highway.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Really?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah. You see, the adventurers regularly make their rounds here.”</p>
<p class="p1">So there are adventurers. He also indicated that there were guilds, so it was fantasy-esque to a T. Now I couldn’t wait to get to the guild.</p>
<p class="p1">“Even I can take care of a goblin or two.”</p>
<p class="p1">As a reference, this is what Randel’s status looked like.</p>
<p class="p1">Name: Randel Age: 39 years old</p>
<p class="p1">Race: Human</p>
<p class="p1">Job: Merchant</p>
<p class="p1">Lv: 13</p>
<p class="p1">HP: 32 MP: 15 Strength: 20 Agility: 22</p>
<p class="p1">Skills: Transport 3, Carriage Driving 2, Bargaining 2, Arithmetic 5, Business 6, Spear Wielding 3, Smart Talking 2</p>
<p class="p1">Equipment: Spear made of scrap iron. leather breastplate, spiderweb coat</p>
<p class="p1">Well, it didn’t look like he’d lose in a one-on-one battle, but it looked like he’d be in trouble if he got surrounded. Despite being only level 4, Fran’s status outshined Randel’s to a spectacular degree.</p>
<p class="p1">“For whatever reason, the demonic beasts have been a lot more active since a month ago.”</p>
<p class="p1">A month ago, he said. That was about the time that I attacked Area 5.</p>
<p class="p1">“Why?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Something must have happened at the Demon Wolf’s Plain.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Demon Wolf’s Plain?”</p>
<p class="p1">“You don’t know what that is? It’s an A rank demonic area to the east of here.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Is it well known?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Of course. It’s not one of the top ten, but it’s still rank A.”</p>
<p class="p1">Demonic area was the the term for things like dungeons, territories that demonic beasts controlled. Each one was given a Threat Level from G to S, and that rank A one was second from the top.</p>
<p class="p1">The only demonic areas above rank A are the top ten S rank areas, so rank A could easily be considered dangerous.</p>
<p class="p1">Did I go hunting there?</p>
<p class="p1">Come to think of it, the boss was strong.</p>
<p class="p1">But I became curious about something.</p>
<p class="p1">“Why is it called the Demon Wolf’s Plain?”</p>
<p class="p1">There were nearly no wolf-type demonic beasts there. Even the boss of the western region was a cat.</p>
<p class="p1">I had no way of knowing why it was called the Demon Wolf’s Plain.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

        </div>
        
<p class="p1">“It’s because there’s a legend that a long, long time ago, an S rank demonic beast called Fenrir died there. They say that Fenrir’s mana remains in the middle of that plain even to this day. Because of that, apparently there’s an interesting phenomenon: the demonic beasts get weaker the closer you get to the center.”</p>
<p class="p1">Shockingly, what I thought was a barrier was actually the mana of Fenrir or something else. And it had already passed away.</p>
<p class="p1">Without that barrier, my life would’ve been a lot more hellish so I really wanted to give my thanks to Fenrir.</p>
<p class="p1">But could there be a connection between the place I found myself in and Fenrir? I was curious.</p>
<p class="p1">“People say there’s an altar or something in the middle of the plain, and there’s an object there that nobody knows the origin of. Several people went to investigate, but they said they couldn’t tell what it was.”</p>
<p class="p1">『Huh? Me? They didn’t know there was a sword there?』</p>
<p class="p1">“You’ve never heard that there was a sword there?”</p>
<p class="p1">“A sword? No, not that I can recall.”</p>
<p class="p1">『Hmm. I had thought that he could tell me where I came from, but it seems I won’t find an answer that easily.』</p>
<p class="p1">Randel didn’t have any more information beyond that. What a shame.</p>
<p class="p1">“Next to the Demon Wolf’s Plain is the Forest of Draining; a special forest that absorbs mana.”</p>
<p class="p1">I had a hard time there. It was a place I didn’t want to back to.</p>
<p class="p1">“Thanks to that, none of the demonic beasts from the Demon Wolf’s Plain go to the outside, but it’s not completely unaffected by the Plain’s effects. Every couple of years, the regions start fighting, or the larger demonic beasts fight each other.”</p>
<p class="p1">I see. Could that be shift from one generation of demonic beasts to the next?</p>
<p class="p1">“That ends up frightening the demonic beasts that live around the Forest of Draining, and it makes them a whole lot more aggressive. Maybe there’s a fight happening in one of the regions?”</p>
<p class="p1">That was totally my fault. Because I hunted all of the regional bosses.</p>
<p class="p1">Could the aftereffects of that have reached all the way here? Teheh.</p>
<p class="p1">Randel hesitated over whether to turn back on the highway, but then he wouldn’t be able to keep the deadline for his transport request, so he decided to forge on through.</p>
<p class="p1">Hahaha. Sorry about that, Randel-san. As an apology, I won’t try and export more from you for being your escort. I really am sorry.</p>
<p class="p1">Two hours after we got on the wagon.</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, there’s Alessa.”</p>
<p class="p1">I saw what looked like a wall on a far hill. It looked like a protective wall constructed around a town.</p>
<p class="p1">Though we could see it, it was still incredibly far away.</p>
<p class="p1">After two more hours on that rickety wagon, I could barely start making out the details of the wall.</p>
<p class="p1">Now that I was looking at it from close by, it was extremely big.</p>
<p class="p1">According to Randel’s explanation, this was the biggest town in the area. With about ten thousand residents.</p>
<p class="p1">And it seemed that Alessa was the only place with a large adventurer’s guild.</p>
<p class="p1">And that was when I realized I had forgotten to ask something important to Randel.</p>
<p class="p1">“How much is the entrance fee?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Ahh, it’s 300 gold.”</p>
<p class="p1">Bad news, we were short.</p>
<p class="p1">He said that everywhere but the Adventurer’s Guild treated goblin horns as worthless, so what do we do?</p>
<p class="p1">I should ask him about all the prices while we had the chance. So that way, I could make some plans for how much to bring for next time.</p>
<p class="p1">“How much for a day’s lodging and food? The cheapest place is fine.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Lodging, you say. The worst inn’s price was about 200 gold, I think. Of course, there’s no food there.”</p>
<p class="p1">The average meal costed 50 gold. One loaf of bread was 10 gold. The cheapest knife was 300 gold. One bath costed 20 gold.</p>
<p class="p1">This was the feel I got from this. 1 gold was worth about 10 yen?</p>
<p class="p1">One copper coin was worth 1 gold, and the denominations went copper coin, large copper coin, silver coin, large silver coin, gold coin, large gold coin, and each one was worth 10 of the coins before it.</p>
<p class="p1">“How much are goblin horns at the guild?”</p>
<p class="p1">“One pair is worth 20 gold. And they’d fetch about 5 gold from a merchant.”</p>
<p class="p1">Cheap! Goblins are so cheap! To think that we can’t even pay for lodging unless we hunt over ten of them…</p>
<p class="p1">But what should we do? Even if we sold the horns from the eight goblins, we still wouldn’t have the 300 gold.</p>
<p class="p1">Maybe I should sell the demonic beast loot I have in my Dimensional Storage?</p>
<p class="p1">That was what I thought, but Randel told us that he couldn’t buy them.</p>
<p class="p1">“The goods I deal in are mostly food-stuffs and weapons. I’m not so sure when it comes to cheap, common things like goblin horns, but I can’t give a professional evaluation of that loot.”</p>
<p class="p1">Oh no, what do I do? Should I force him to buy it, even at a low price? But that’s also a waste…</p>
<p class="p1">As I was worrying about this, my Detection picked up something new.</p>
<p class="p1">Further along the highway.</p>
<p class="p1">I had Randel slow down and we scouted ahead</p>
<p class="p1">There were goblins hiding in the forest. They were probably waiting to ambush someone.</p>
<p class="p1">We ended them in a flash with Fran’s Sword Techniques and my magic.</p>
<p class="p1">We retrieved horns from the five goblins, when our eyes fell on one goblin’s sword.</p>
<p class="p1">A club probably wouldn’t be worth a thing, but I thought that a sword should fetch at least a small price.</p>
<p class="p1">『What luck. We might have 300 gold if we sell this to Randel.』</p>
<p class="p1">We asked Randel about it, and he bought it for 100 gold. It was more expensive than I thought.</p>
<p class="p1">“You’re buying it for so much?”</p>
<p class="p1">“It may be made of bronze, but it’s in good condition. It must have gotten the sword from an adventurer recently.”</p>
<p class="p1">We really were lucky. And so, we were able to enter the town.</p>
<p class="p1">We should hold onto the goblin horns and submit them to the guild.</p>
<p class="p1">On the way, we hunted one more demonic beast, and we sold its loot to Randel.</p>
<p class="p1">It was a fifty centimeter long, umber beetle called Black Bug. Apparently its carapace is used for armor for beginners. He said he knew how much this was worth, so he bought it for 20 gold. It may actually be better to focus on goblins that have weapons. Goblins were truly fated to be hunted by me.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yo. Randel, it’s you. You look no worse for the wear.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah, though there were some close shaves along the way.”</p>
<p class="p1">“And that young lady?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Picked her up while on my way here. Could you take care of her entrance procedures?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Got it. You sure were lucky that Randel’s wagon was passing by. I bet you felt safe, since Randel is so strong.”</p>
<p class="p1">Randel gave a wry smile at the gatekeeper’s words. When the truth was, Fran was the one escorting Randel.</p>
<p class="p1">We didn’t want to attract attention, so we asked Randel to just call Fran a traveler he picked up while coming here.</p>
<p class="p1">“That’ll be 300 gold. That’s the entrance fee. It’s good for three days. Pay close attention to that, since you’ll have to pay again if you try and come in again after that.”</p>
<p class="p1">We had already heard that before. And that after becoming either legal citizens or receiving an adventurer card, there was no entrance fee.</p>
<p class="p1">Thus, we needed to get an adventurer card as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="p1">“Welcome to Alessia.”</p>
<p class="p1">He said there was no age restriction for joining the Adventurer’s Guild. But there was an aptitude test, and if we failed to pass, then they wouldn’t issue us a card.</p>
<p class="p1">“Then I’ll be going back to my shop. Fran-san, will you be going straight to the Adventurer’s Guild?</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">“My shop is at the far west from there. Come by when you have some free time.”</p>
<p class="p1">After saying that, Randel left.</p>
<p class="p1">He didn’t ask us anything even while leaving. Completely ignorant of the ways of the world, but possessed of incredible skill, such a strange little girl was walking by herself along the highway. There was clearly a story behind this. But he didn’t mention this even until the end. He was a good person.</p>
<p class="p1">He said he does business with adventurers, so we should meet with him when we have some money.</p>
<p class="p1">『Then shall we go?』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">We walked along the road that Randel directed us on that would bring us to the Adventurer’s Guild.</p>
<p class="p1">Hmm, it really was a clean city. It was like a European medieval city.</p>
<p class="p1">It was nice. It absolutely oozed a fantasy feel.</p>
<p class="p1">And it was the first time since I came to this world that I saw so many people. That alone was enough to make me delighted.</p>
<p class="p1">But what was even more exciting were the extra-racial people mixed in with the humans.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"> Like a beastfolk man with animal ears and a tail, or a shockingly alluring, busty elf</span>——no, a lady elf. From hirsute dwarfs to young men with what looked like insect wings on their backs, there were all manner of races walking along the street.</p>
<p class="p3">And among the people I just mentioned, I could spot the occasional person who looked like an adventurer.</p>
<p class="p3">I checked their status, and they were all definitely lower than Fran. Though there were quite a few of them that were very close.</p>
<p class="p3">But the number of skills we had and the skill levels were overwhelmingly higher.</p>
<p class="p3">The highest skill level I saw among the people I observed was an adventurer with Sword Wielding 7. I could tell that my Sword Wielding 7 was unusual.</p>
<p class="p3">It was possible to defeat an opponent with stronger stats if you used skills. That was something I learned first hand by fighting in the plain.</p>
<p class="p3">You could even say that, to at least a small degree, a difference in stats is meaningless in comparison to a difference in skills.</p>
<p class="p3">With that in mind, Fran would likely have no difficulty living as an adventurer.</p>
<p class="p3">But there was something else that weighed on my mind.</p>
<p class="p3">I looked at the abilities of the adventurers’ equipped weapons, but…</p>
<p class="p1">Name: High Quality Steel Long Sword</p>
<p class="p1">Attack: 398 MP: 5 Durability 600</p>
<p class="p1">Mana Conversion Rate F</p>
<p class="p1">Skills: None</p>
<p class="p1">A longsword like me. But its attack power was leaps and bounds beyond mine. The fact that I beat it in the lines after that tidbit did nothing to comfort me. I felt that I had been defeated as a sword.</p>
<p class="p1">And what was even worse was the sword’s material.</p>
<p class="p1">High quality steel.</p>
<p class="p1">In other words, I hadn’t lost to a legendary metal like mythril or orichalcum, but to mere iron. That hit me hard.</p>
<p class="p1">After that, I saw tons of weapons were flaunting attack stats higher than mine.</p>
<p class="p1">Because about one in every five people had a weapon like that.</p>
<p class="p1">And the clincher was hanging at a man’s hip.</p>
<p class="p1">Name: Mythril Alloy Dagger</p>
<p class="p1">Attack: 423 MP: 20 Durability: 700</p>
<p class="p1">Mana Conversion Rate D</p>
<p class="p1">Skills: None</p>
<p class="p1">『Ha, hahahaha…』</p>
<p class="p1">At this point, all I could do was laugh.</p>
<p class="p1">Ahh, so I was just a dull knife. I was just full of bluster from killing those demonic beasts.</p>
<p class="p1">Something like me is just an overly decorated sword that was all talk.</p>
<p class="p1">“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="p1">『Ahh, Fran. I was completely wrong.』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un?”</p>
<p class="p1">I explained what I saw to Fran.</p>
<p class="p1">That if I didn’t have skills, I would just be a crap sword, inferior to all the weapons around us.</p>
<p class="p1">I was almost certainly a sword created by some showoff noble who got tired of me.</p>
<p class="p1">Pat pat.</p>
<p class="p1">Fran stroked my blade.</p>
<p class="p1">『Fran…』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">『Are you comforting something as useless as me?』</p>
<p class="p1">“Master has skills.”</p>
<p class="p1">What a nice young lady!</p>
<p class="p1">That was right. Even if I was a crap sword compared to the sold swords in terms of attack power, I could act as support with my skills.</p>
<p class="p1">That was the only worth I had.</p>
<p class="p1">I’ve decided! I’ll become a skill master!</p>
<p class="p1">But I wanted to buy her a nice sword, not a dull one like me.</p>
<p class="p1">She didn’t have a choice but to use me now, but I’ll buy her a strong one later.</p>
<p class="p1">And to do that, we’ll need to enter the guild and make tons of money!</p>
<p class="p1">『Great, sorry for worrying you. I’m okay now. Let’s go to the Adventurer’s Guild.』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">Though we wasted time because of me, we were able to make it to the Adventurer’s Guild.</p>
<p class="p1">『It’s big.』</p>
<p class="p1">The building was big even compared to the other buildings around it.</p>
<p class="p1">It was an indication that there were lots of adventurers inside.</p>
<p class="p1">『Here we come!』</p>
<p class="p1">I gave a shout. Though nobody could hear it.</p>
<p class="p1">The inside was cleaner than I thought.</p>
<p class="p1">Though I was expecting a more rustic, pub-like interior.</p>
<p class="p1">It was kind of like the lobby of a classy hotel.</p>
<p class="p1">Well, it would do the guild’s reputation harm if it was too much of a mess, so I supposed it made sense.</p>
<p class="p1">But a twelve-year-old girl entering alone attracted a lot of attention.</p>
<p class="p1">Many adventurers around us watched as Fran walked towards the counter.</p>
<p class="p1">“This is the Adventurer’s Guild, so…”</p>
<p class="p1">“I know. I want to join.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, okay. Just you alone?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Un, just me.”</p>
<p class="p1">It seemed that even in this world, a twelve-year-old girl joining a guild all by herself was a rare occurrence.</p>
<p class="p1">It would likely have been okay if the twelve-year-old girl had a proper sword and armor, and nonchalantly gave off the vibe that she had been hunting since she was young.</p>
<p class="p1">But Fran didn’t even have any armor on.</p>
<p class="p1">Rather, her outfit was in a mess so she looked like a run-away slave.</p>
<p class="p1">She didn’t fit into this place at all.</p>
<p class="p1">The female receptionist that Fran just talked to gave her an explanation.</p>
<p class="p1">“Every applicant must take an test before being accepted.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Will a full-contact fight be okay?”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s okay.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Will it truly be okay? There are cases in which applicants have been injured.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t care.”</p>
<p class="p1">“The guild is not responsible for anything that happens.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Okay.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Is that, I see… Understood. Please wait a moment.”</p>
<p class="p1">Having realized that Fran was taking the test, the adventurers began talking amongst themselves.</p>
<p class="p1">No one was going to try to stop us, but they weren’t particularly welcoming, either.</p>
<p class="p1">It felt like they were looking down on Fran, thinking it inane that such a young child would want to become an adventure.</p>
<p class="p1">That should be obvious. If I were in their shoes, I would have thought the exact same thing.</p>
<p class="p1">『Fran you okay?』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un?”</p>
<p class="p1">『No, it’s nothing.』</p>
<p class="p1">The receptionist came back after we waited for a bit.</p>
<p class="p1">“Pardon the wait. Please come this way.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">She lead us to a room within the guild, a gymnasium with all four walls covered in bricks. It seemed to be the guild’s training grounds.</p>
<p class="p1">A strong looking man was standing in that training ground.</p>
<p class="p1">He was likely over two meters tall. In addition, he had on cumbersome black armor with spikes, so he looked just like some turn-of-the-century overlord. Standing at his side was a large combat axe, amplifying that feeling.</p>
<p class="p1">I could almost hear the menacing sound effects.</p>
<p class="p1">A normal kid would likely have burst into tears at just the sight of him.</p>
<p class="p1">Because even someone like me who was used to the threatening feeling inspired by demonic beasts was a little surprised.</p>
<p class="p1">“Are you the potential recruit?”</p>
<p class="p1">Uwah. He was incredibly intimidating despite just staring at us.</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">But Fran didn’t seem afraid at all. She was acting the same as usual.</p>
<p class="p1">Our young lady is amazing!</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m Dunadrond, your examiner.”</p>
<p class="p1">That’s way too many “D”s. It was hard to pronounce.</p>
<p class="p1">“The test itself is simple. You just have to fight me. If you lose too easily, then you fail!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Okay.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’ll tell you this ahead of time, but it’s hard for me to hold back. I’m going to go all out, so you’d better leave if you don’t want to get hurt!”</p>
<p class="p1">The moment Dunadrond shouted that, a powerful pressure came over us.</p>
<p class="p1">Did he just use an Intimidation skill? Did that mean the fight already started?</p>
<p class="p1">『Great, let’s give it a shot!』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un!”</p>
<p class="p1">We were currently in a battle with Dunadrond at the Adventurer Guild’s training grounds.</p>
<p class="p1">He was overpoweringly menacing.</p>
<p class="p1">If I were in a human body, I might have bowed my head and begged for my life. Thank goodness I was a sword.</p>
<p class="p1">I wonder how his stats are.</p>
<p class="p1">Name: Dunadrond Age: 46 years old</p>
<p class="p1">Race: Noble</p>
<p class="p1">Job: Greater Warrior</p>
<p class="p1">Lv: 38</p>
<p class="p1">HP: 246 MP: 133 Strength: 198 Agility: 131</p>
<p class="p1">Skills: Intimidate 4, Transport 3, Recovery Speed Boost 5, Sense Danger 4, Instructing 4, Regeneration 5, Speed 6, Earth Magic 2, Throwing 4, Poison Resistance 7, Tree Chopping 3, Axe Techniques 6, Axe Wielding 7, Roar 3, Revival, Energy Manipulation, Harden Muscles, Automatic HP Regeneration, Strength Boost [small]</p>
<p class="p1">Equipment: Heavy Tempered Steel Axe, Great Black Tortoise’s Full Body Armor, Tyrant’s Mantle, Snake Hide Boots, Executive’s Bracelet</p>
<p class="p1">Uwaah! That’s super strong! In terms of stats, he totally beat us.</p>
<p class="p1">This man, in terms of physical strength, surpassed the lesser wyverns.</p>
<p class="p1">And his skills, for the most part, were pretty high leveled. And the same for his weapon’s rank.</p>
<p class="p1">Name; Twin Headed Steel Axe</p>
<p class="p1">Attack: 650 MP: 3 Durability: 650</p>
<p class="p1">Mana Conversion Rate E</p>
<p class="p1">It has an attack of 650? No freaking way! It doesn’t scare me one bit, got it?!</p>
<p class="p1">He was even a cool race, a Noble.</p>
<p class="p1">It seemed like being an examiner wasn’t just for show.</p>
<p class="p1">The other adventurers I’d seen didn’t even come close to matching him.</p>
<p class="p1">Was he serious when he said he’d be coming at us without holding back? Isn’t this just a beginner’s test?</p>
<p class="p1">I was pretty sure a normal beginner would lose in a flash…</p>
<p class="p1">Whatever. We should do all we can. After all, even if we don’t win, they said we just had to show them our ability.</p>
<p class="p1">『Fran, you ready?』</p>
<p class="p1">“Okay.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Then let’s go!”</p>
<p class="p1">In the next moment, Dunadrond became a blur.</p>
<p class="p1">And Fran flew to the side in an instant.</p>
<p class="p1">Boom!</p>
<p class="p1">That massive man approached us faster than I could’ve imagined and he swung the axe down at us. That huge axe went through the training ground’s floor, producing a cloud of dust.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hoo, so you dodged it!”</p>
<p class="p1">『That was close!』</p>
<p class="p1">I saw that his axe was stuck in the ground right next to us. Seeing as how big a hole he made in the ground, he was incredibly strong.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hyap!”</p>
<p class="p1">He lifted his axe again and struck down.</p>
<p class="p1">Boom!</p>
<p class="p1">The ground was once again ripped apart and reduced to gravel.</p>
<p class="p1">Her bangs fluttered backwards at the wind pressure.</p>
<p class="p1">Hey, old man, wasn’t that attack just now dangerous? It’d leave a serious wound if it even grazed her.</p>
<p class="p1">This is ridiculous! Has anyone passed this test before?</p>
<p class="p1">『It’s dangerous to only run away. I’m attacking!』</p>
<p class="p1">I wasn’t only observing the situation. I needed to land a strong hit before one of his strong attacks connected.</p>
<p class="p1">I didn’t have to worry about killing him. He wasn’t only overwhelmingly strong, but he also had on Executive’s Bracelets.</p>
<p class="p1">It was an item that absorbed the damage from a fatal attack once.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hah!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Hoo, you’re fast!”</p>
<p class="p1">It was blocked completely by his axe.</p>
<p class="p1">I had secretly cast support magic, increasing Fran’s strength and agility, but our opponent was still stronger.</p>
<p class="p1">But that wasn’t all.</p>
<p class="p1">While he was busy blocking Fran’s consecutive attacks, the earth beneath Dunadrond’s feet rose up like tentacles and wrapped around his legs.</p>
<p class="p1">“Whoa! Silent casting?!”</p>
<p class="p1">Hmph, she surprised him. Well, it was because Fran didn’t give any sign that she was preparing a spell.</p>
<p class="p1">The truth is, I had secretly cast and activated the earth magic.</p>
<p class="p1">Dunadrond, too busy holding off Fran, was unable to avoid the magic at his feet.</p>
<p class="p1">And seeing Dunadrond try and retreat, Fran let loose a strong technique.</p>
<p class="p1">Though his feet were stuck, he was able to block Fran’s attack with only the free movement of his upper body.</p>
<p class="p1">But he won’t be able to block this. Just try.</p>
<p class="p1">“Tri-Explosion.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Uwhoooa!”</p>
<p class="p1">Level 10 fire magic engulfed Dunadrond.</p>
<p class="p1">The three simultaneous explosions, coming at him from three directions, were not only difficult to block, but also obscured his vision. Of course, it seemed like Fran cast it, but I was the one who activated the spell.</p>
<p class="p1">In other words, while I was casting the spell, Fran was readying her sword technique.</p>
<p class="p1">“Huuuup. Dragon Fang!”</p>
<p class="p1">A Sword Techniques 7 stab. Additionally boosted with Telekinesis.</p>
<p class="p1">Fran charged at Dunadrond as he was unable to keep his balance from her barrage.</p>
<p class="p1">He must have realized what techinque Fran used.</p>
<p class="p1">Dunadrond opened his eyes wide in shock and made an astonished face.</p>
<p class="p1">“How can such a little girl…! How can she use magic and Sword Techniques consecutively?!”</p>
<p class="p1">Dunadrond, unable to move his body, couldn’t dodge Fran’s attack.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s over.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Kwaaagh!”</p>
<p class="p1">I sliced through Dunadrond’s side and once again sent him flying.</p>
<p class="p1">Slam!</p>
<p class="p1">Though he was likely around two hundred kilograms, we sent him flying ten meters and halfway through the brick wall of the training grounds.</p>
<p class="p1">I had only ever used it on demonic beasts, so I got to find out how it worked on people.</p>
<p class="p1">But was that too much? He probably didn’t die.</p>
<p class="p1">“…Cough…”</p>
<p class="p1">Thank goodness he’s alive.</p>
<p class="p1">Dunadrond seemed to still be conscious despite coughing up a lot of blood.</p>
<p class="p1">Fran slowly walked towards him.</p>
<p class="p1">Was he trying to use recovery magic?</p>
<p class="p1">And as I was watching him to see what he was doing, Fran lifted me up to right in front of Dunadrond’s eyes.</p>
<p class="p1">“Did I pass?”</p>
<p class="p1">Yeah, Fran was keeping her cool.</p>
<p class="p1">I had completely forgotten that this was a test.</p>
<p class="p1">“…Kuha, ha. You pass.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Okay.”</p>
<p class="p1">Is he still able to move? How sturdy is this guy? I stabbed a whole through his side.</p>
<p class="p1">But he was oblivious of my surprise and laughed all of a sudden when he got out of the wall.</p>
<p class="p1">It seemed like he actually did go easy on us. If he had decided to go all out, then he would’ve disregarded our counterattack and swung down with his axe. Well, maybe this was normal because it was a test.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hahahahaha! This is the first time a beginner did so much damage to me!”</p>
<p class="p1">That guy was monstrously sturdy. Is there anyone who can kill him?</p>
<p class="p1">“Dunadrond-san!”</p>
<p class="p1">The receptionist ran towards us, perhaps having heard the destruction.</p>
<p class="p1">“Please tell me you didn’t go all out——. Huh?</p>
<p class="p1">Ahh, I see. Did she think that he had went full out against a beginner?</p>
<p class="p1">Well, she probably didn’t think that that sound was Fran sending the examiner flying.</p>
<p class="p1">“Huh? Huuuh?”</p>
<p class="p1">The attendant seemed genuinely surprised at seeing Dunadrond covered in blood.</p>

		<p class="p1">Chapter 2 <strong>The Sword and the Girl Met</strong></p>

<p class="p1">The slave traders and the slaves were in a panic.</p>
<p class="p1">Because of the appearance of the two-headed bear that was chasing them.</p>
<p class="p1">The slave traders’ wagon was attacked in the forest by the demonic beast. That’s probably what happened.</p>
<p class="p1">The slave traders and their lackey forced the slaves to quickly pick up the bags.</p>
<p class="p1">And they gave a different order to the other slaves.</p>
<p class="p1">“Slaves, stop that thing!”</p>
<p class="p1">They were probably planning on running away while the slaves were doing that.</p>
<p class="p1">The slaves didn’t even have any weapons. Telling them to stop it was the same as telling them to slow it down by being its food. The slaves knew that as well.</p>
<p class="p1">But the slaves that had already turned their backs to run away stopped in their tracks and ran towards the bear.</p>
<p class="p1">“No~!”</p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t want to die!”</p>
<p class="p1">The slaves ran screaming to their deaths at the hands of the bear demonic beast.</p>
<p class="p1">Seeing them like that, I realized that the slaves couldn’t disobey the slave traders. Are they being controlled by a spell or something? It was probably an effect of their identical collars. I felt a faint trace of magic from them. I could have sensed things more clearly if this place weren’t absorbing my mana…</p>
<p class="p1">Just as the mana absorption didn’t extend to inside my body, it didn’t interfere with the collars’ compulsion. If the absorption was that strong, then all the mana would have been sucked out of my body.</p>
<p class="p1">“Kuwaaaah!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Uwaaagh!”</p>
<p class="p1">The male slave was sent flying by the bear’s strike.</p>
<p class="p1">All it did was swing its front paw and it sent the two halves of the slave flying.</p>
<p class="p1">Even if it was a low-ranked monster, it wasn’t something the slaves could beat when they didn’t have even a single pice of decent equipment. The slaves were utterly helpless against that raging mass of demonic beast.</p>
<p class="p1">At this rate, the slaves would be annihilated in less than a few minutes.</p>
<p class="p1">I desperately wanted to help but there was nothing I could do.</p>
<p class="p1">Because I couldn’t talk to them.</p>
<p class="p1">All I could do was watch the pieces-of-trash slave traders run away.</p>
<p class="p1">Shit! If only someone would pick me up.</p>
<p class="p1">“Kuwaaaaaaaaahhhh!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Guwaahh!”</p>
<p class="p1">Great, the slave trader’s lackey was sent flying by the bear’s charge. Serves him right!</p>
<p class="p1">Isn’t there any way to save the slaves and only the slaves?</p>
<p class="p1">As I was thinking that, a person’s shadow appeared in front of me.</p>
<p class="p1">It was a slave girl.</p>
<p class="p1">The girl was probably under the command of the lackey that just died. The<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>command was lifted after he was killed by the bear and let the slaves move freely.</p>
<p class="p1">But my gaze was fixed not on the girl’s face, nor her dirty appearance, nor her messy hair, but what was above all that.</p>
<p class="p1">There were ears. Cat ears!</p>
<p class="p1">There were animal ears on top of her head! She was a cat girl.</p>
<p class="p1">She had fluffy ears!</p>
<p class="p1">My amazement caused me to forget for a moment the gruesome scene before me. Because these were one of the treasures of the world: cat ears. I couldn’t help but be amazed.</p>
<p class="p1">Aah, damn it! I wish I could talk with her!</p>
<p class="p1">Little girl, pick me up. And let me touch those cat ears! No, wait. How can I touch them if I’m a sword? With Telekinesis? No, no, since I can feel things, if I rub the flat of my blade against them——.</p>
<p class="p1">In that time, the girl clung to me. And pulled.</p>
<p class="p1">Even though she was just told to die, she was still trying to live. Even in this hopeless situation, she didn’t give up her life. I wanted to be used by a young lady like her.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">『</span>…Hup.<span class="s1">』</span></p>
<p class="p1">The girl pulled even harder.</p>
<p class="p1">Yeah! Pull me out!</p>
<p class="p1">But I was stuck in the ground even deeper than I thought. The clay-like dirt sticking to my blade had become a disaster, stopping me from being easily pulled out.</p>
<p class="p1">She looked about twelve or thirteen years old. I could tell by her thin frame that she had never been given a proper meal.</p>
<p class="p1">That girl couldn’t pull out the sword with those weak arms.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>First Picture of Fran 196</b></p>
<p class="p1">You can do it! C’mon, you can do it! No wait, first look behind you!</p>
<p class="p1">The bear had inexplicably lumbered towards the girl.</p>
<p class="p1">What about the other slaves? Did the bear already…the poor slaves were mercilessly killed and their corpses entered my sight.</p>
<p class="p1">The only one left was the girl.</p>
<p class="p3">『Pull me out!』</p>
<p class="p3">“A voice?”</p>
<p class="p3">『C-can you hear my voice?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Who is that?”</p>
<p class="p3">『I’m the sword. The sword you’re trying to pul out.』</p>
<p class="p3">“…You surprised me.”</p>
<p class="p3">『You don’t look surprised at all…』</p>
<p class="p3">“I was.”</p>
<p class="p3">『More importantly, the bear is coming this way! C’mon girl, pull me out!』</p>
<p class="p3">Apparently, I could use Telepathy even in this place as long as her hand made contact. And she seemed like the expressionless &amp; quiet type of character. I didn’t dislike it.</p>
<p class="p3">But the important thing right now was the bear!</p>
<p class="p3">The girl grunted and pulled.</p>
<p class="p3">Du-du.</p>
<p class="p3">『You moved me a little!』</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> “U</span>u—un.”</p>
<p class="p3">『Harder!』</p>
<p class="p3">Du-du-du.</p>
<p class="p3">『Just a little left!』</p>
<p class="p3">“Guuuu.”</p>
<p class="p3">Swing!</p>
<p class="p3">『You pulled me out!』</p>
<p class="p3">“What a pretty sword.”</p>
<p class="p3">『Thanks! But now’s not the time for that!』</p>
<p class="p3">“Right.”</p>
<p class="p3">『Can you fight?』</p>
<p class="p3">“A little.”</p>
<p class="p3">I checked the girl’s status.</p>
<p class="p3">Name: No Name Age: 12 years old</p>
<p class="p3">Race: Beastfolk. Black Cat</p>
<p class="p3">Job: None</p>
<p class="p3">Status: Slave</p>
<p class="p3">Lv: 3</p>
<p class="p3">HP: 19 MP: 10 Strength: 9 Agility: 16</p>
<p class="p3">Skills: Sword Wielding 1, Night Vision, Ability to Skin Prey, Directional Sense</p>
<p class="p3">It really is just a little! But that was okay.</p>
<p class="p3">『Equip me!』</p>
<p class="p3">“I already did.”</p>
<p class="p3">『Stronger, really think that you want to equip me!』</p>
<p class="p3">“Okay.”</p>
<p class="p3">&lt;No Name was registered as the wielder&gt;</p>
<p class="p3">Great, now I was able to see for the first time how Skill Sharing would work.</p>
<p class="p3">&lt;No Name has gained multiple titles&gt;</p>
<p class="p3">『Huh? All of a sudden?』</p>
<p class="p3">Looks like…I can use Appraisal.</p>
<p class="p3">The girl acquired four titles: Flame Arts User, Cooking Master, Dismantling Master, and Skill Collector. It seemed that after skill level 10, a title related to that skill gets added. So there’s a benefit to improving each skill. Skill Collector seemed to increase the efficiency of gaining skill levels.</p>
<p class="p3">Well, that wouldn’t be of any help now, so I’ll check it later.</p>
<p class="p3">『Fight. You’ll be able to fight.』</p>
<p class="p3">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p3">『I’m going to defeat that thing. Keep that in your head. And trust your senses and swing the sword!』</p>
<p class="p3">The Sword Wielding skill should take care of the rest somehow.</p>
<p class="p3">The opponent was a low-rank monster.</p>
<p class="p3">There was no way she could lose with a Sword Wielding of level 7. There was even status boosting effects on top of that.</p>
<p class="p3">“…Un, okay.”</p>
<p class="p3">『Great, good girl.』</p>
<p class="p3">“…I’m going!”</p>
<p class="p3">To describe the girl’s movements as beautiful would be more than enough. She moved like an adept swordswoman, closing the distance to the bear and stabbing it accurately through the heart. I didn’t feel any resistance; as if she had stabbed tofu.</p>
<p class="p3">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="p3">『What do you think? Wasn’t that easy?』</p>
<p class="p3">“…Because of the sword?”</p>
<p class="p3">『Yep. Make sure to say thanks.』</p>
<p class="p3">“Un. Thanks.”</p>
<p class="p3">The girl was about to put me back in the ground and I quickly stopped her.</p>
<p class="p3">『Wait! Don’t put me in the ground!』</p>
<p class="p3">“?”</p>
<p class="p3">『The ground here makes me unable to do anything. So hold me for a while.』</p>
<p class="p3">“Uuun?”</p>
<p class="p3">『You can’t?』</p>
<p class="p3">“He’s probably going to come get me.”</p>
<p class="p3">『Are you talking about the slave trader?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p3">No way. I was lucky enough to meet a fluffy-eared cat girl. I’m saying I want to be wielded by her!</p>
<p class="p3">If the trader finds me, for all I know he might sell me to some rich prick and I might end up sealed in a hell even worse than this one.</p>
<p class="p3">『Hey, want to run away?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Can’t. I can’t disobey him because of this collar.”</p>
<p class="p3">『So it’s a magical tool?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Slave collar. We can’t disobey any order. I tried to kill them multiple times but I failed.”</p>
<p class="p3">『Are you saying you tried to kill the slave traders?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Un. Tried to kill them and run away.”</p>
<p class="p3">Whooa. She’s way more hungry &amp; dangerous than I thought. But I didn’t dislike it.</p>
<p class="p3">『But you failed because of the collar?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p3">I saw a man appear from the forest while I was talking with the girl.</p>
<p class="p3">It was the slave trader.</p>
<p class="p3">“Only one of you’s alive?! And all of the pots are broken! Almost everything’s gone. Shit!”</p>
<p class="p3">He didn’t look like he was mourning the deaths of the slaves or the lackey at all. Instead, he was saddened by the destruction of his cargo. Geez, this guy was almost</p>
<p class="p3">“…”</p>
<p class="p3">“Are you the one who killed the Twin Head Bear?</p>
<p class="p3">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="p3">“How did you…what’s that sword?”</p>
<p class="p3">“I found it.”</p>
<p class="p3">“Hey, give it to me.”</p>
<p class="p3">“…Okay.”</p>
<p class="p3">“The hell’re you looking at me like that for? Hmph!”</p>
<p class="p3">“Awuk. Sor-ry.”</p>
<p class="p3">No way. That man just suddenly slapped the girl.</p>
<p class="p3">“Tch, how dare a beast look at me with those dead eyes.”</p>
<p class="p3">He hit her again! And it seemed like this was normal.</p>
<p class="p3">The slave trader took the sword from the curled up girl.</p>
<p class="p3">“Hooo. What a beautiful sword. Maybe it’ll make up for all the damages?”</p>
<p class="p3">The man ignored the girl who was groaning in pain and began to appraise me.</p>
<p class="p3">“Hey, beast. Get whatever goods are useable and carry them on your back. Then we’re going to the town.”</p>
<p class="p3">The girl was unable to disobey the man’s words because of the slave collar. She shakily stood up despite the pain she must have felt.</p>
<p class="p3">That son of a… He’s pissing me off. Really pissing me off. I was on the verge of murdering him.</p>
<p class="p3">Shit! I would’ve killed him already if only this place wasn’t absorbing my mana!</p>
<p class="p3">“Kuhegh?”</p>
<p class="p3">While I was thinking that, I tried using Telekinesis and it worked. Teheh.</p>
<p class="p3">No, it seemed that the mana absorption weakened a little if I got away from the ground.</p>
<p class="p3">When I was stuck in the ground, my magic was absorbed instantaneously, but now there was about a one second delay.</p>
<p class="p3">So when I thought that I wanted to kill the slave trader and I used Telekinesis with all my might, my body sprung up with alacrity. I stabbed completely through the slave trader’s face, even splitting apart his skull and brains splattered everywhere.</p>

        </div>
        
<p class="p3">Huh? Looks like I made a whoopsie?</p>
<p class="p3">Hmm. Maybe because he was trash? Or because I’m a sword? I didn’t feel any guilt. It was the same feeling as when I first killed a goblin.</p>
<p class="p3">『Hm, what should we do now?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Un?”</p>
<p class="p3">『Let’s check the situation for now. Stay calm.』</p>
<p class="p3">“I am calm.”</p>
<p class="p3">『You’re way too composed.』</p>
<p class="p3">She was way more “My Pace” than I first thought. I could see her becoming a star player (big shot?).</p>
<p class="p3">『You’re my wielder.』</p>
<p class="p3">“I am.”</p>
<p class="p3">『I’m basically a magic sword so I’m…pretty strong.』</p>
<p class="p3">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p3">『So I want you to use me in the future as well. As a sword. I don’t want to end up on a shelf somewhere. Do you have any plans on using me? By that, I mean do you have any plans on fighting demonic beasts by using me? That’s the gist of it.』</p>
<p class="p3">I couldn’t force such a life onto this girl.</p>
<p class="p3">She’s the first wielder I met and I really wanted her to use me, but I’ll give up if she says no.</p>
<p class="p3">“I do. I really do.”</p>
<p class="p3">She gave an immediate answer. She looked heroic as she gripped me tight and raised me towards the sky.</p>
<p class="p3">“I’m going to get stronger. For sure.”</p>
<p class="p3">She said that intensely; there must have been some kind of circumstances.</p>
<p class="p3">『Do you have a goal?』</p>
<p class="p3">“I’m going to break through the wall.”</p>
<p class="p3">『The wall? What’s that?』</p>
<p class="p3">She told me that Beastfolk can evolve just like demonic beasts.</p>
<p class="p3">There are all kinds of conditions, but Beastfolk admire and respect their evolved brethren.</p>
<p class="p3">But the majority of Beastfolk die before they evolve.</p>
<p class="p3">That meant it was that difficult to evolve.</p>
<p class="p3">And because no one of the girl’s race, the Black Cats, have ever evolved, even the other Beastfolk treat them like the dregs of society.</p>
<p class="p3">The girl’s parents also tried to evolve, but their strength failed them during the height of their adventure. After that, the girl who had been left behind was abducted by the slave traders.</p>
<p class="p3">The girl said she inherited their wish and that her goal was to evolve.</p>
<p class="p3">『Yeah, yeah! That’s a good story! I really like it! I’ll definitely get you to evolve!』</p>
<p class="p3">“Really?”</p>
<p class="p3">『Yes! First, let’s train super hard and get stronger. And then we’ll go to a dungeon, level up there, and then evolve!』</p>
<p class="p3">“Thanks.”</p>
<p class="p3">『Ah c’mon, it’s nothing much! After all, a wielder and her sword aren’t strangers! Um, come to think of it, what’s your name?』</p>
<p class="p3">I had still not asked my precious wielder her name.</p>
<p class="p3">But the girl’s answer was as I expected.</p>
<p class="p3">“Don’t have one.”</p>
<p class="p3">『So you really don’t have a name?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Don’t have one.”</p>
<p class="p3">It did say she didn’t have a name, but she really didn’t have one.</p>
<p class="p3">『How?』</p>
<p class="p3">If she had parents, then there was no way she didn’t have a name.</p>
<p class="p3">“After the slave contract, your name disappears.”</p>
<p class="p3">『Huuh? What’s that mean?』</p>
<p class="p3">『Some owners want to give their slaves new names. So my name’s gone.』</p>
<p class="p3">I see. That must mean the contract took away her ability to say her name. It reminded me somehow of Yubasa taking away Chihiro’s name (tn: Spirited Away reference).</p>
<p class="p3">“I was eight when I became a slave and my name disappeared.”</p>
<p class="p3">Then that meant for the four years she was a slave, she never gave up her goal. Even though her life must have terrible. That made me respect her a little more.</p>
<p class="p3">『I see… Then, what was your name before that?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Fran.”</p>
<p class="p3">It was the same name as the dog I raised long ago, but it wasn’t bad. And it was easy for me to say.</p>
<p class="p3">『Hmm. Then your name is Fran.』</p>
<p class="p3">“It’s okay?”</p>
<p class="p3">『Why? Is something wrong?』</p>
<p class="p3">“No. That’s not it. My name is Fran.”</p>
<p class="p3">She looked happy. Her tail was sticking straight up and she was nodding her head.</p>
<p class="p3">Now talking to her was easier.</p>
<p class="p3">But the next thing Fran said surprised me.</p>
<p class="p3">“What’s your name?”</p>
<p class="p3">『Huh? Mine?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="p3">I hadn’t talked with anyone since I reincarnated so I didn’t have a name. I hadn’t thought about it to an almost pathetic degree.</p>
<p class="p3">I couldn’t remember my name before reincarnating, and my status said my name was Unknown.</p>
<p class="p3">Shit! I would’ve thought of a really cool one if I knew this was going to happen!</p>
<p class="p3">『Um…』</p>
<p class="p3">“Don’t have one?”</p>
<p class="p3">『Yes.』</p>
<p class="p3">“Well then, I’ll give you one.”</p>
<p class="p3">I mean, that sounded okay. Since she’s my wielder.</p>
<p class="p3">I’ll probably get closer to her if Fran calls me by a name she likes.</p>
<p class="p3">I didn’t feel picky about it so any name was good.</p>
<p class="p3">“Mmmm…?”</p>
<p class="p3">『Badump badump.』</p>
<p class="p3">“Hmmm…?”</p>
<p class="p3">『What could it be…?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Guuuu… I decided.”</p>
<p class="p3">『Oh! Okay! So? What is it?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Master.”</p>
<p class="p3">『What?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Master.”</p>
<p class="p3">『Why?』</p>
<p class="p3">“You said that you would train me. So you’re Master.”</p>
<p class="p3">『Ah, did you come up with anything else? Is that it?』</p>
<p class="p3">“No. I am in your care, Master.”</p>
<p class="p3">&lt;Name has been set to Master&gt;</p>
<p class="p3">Uwah! The notice descended! No way, my name’s Master? For real?</p>
<p class="p3">“Do you hate it?”</p>
<p class="p3">Her lack of expression didn’t change at all, but there was a slight sign of worry in her face. Though it was very slight.</p>
<p class="p3">There was no way I could say I hate it if she makes that face!</p>
<p class="p3">『I don’t hate it at all! What a good name!』</p>
<p class="p3">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p3">And that is how my name became Master. How should I put it; I thought it was a peculiar name for a sword, but it didn’t matter to me because Fran liked it. That’s what I told myself.</p>
<p class="p3">『Then what should we do now? The slave trader’s dead, but what happened to the contract? Is it gone now?』</p>
<p class="p3">“No. The collar didn’t come off.”</p>
<p class="p3">Fran pointed at the collar.</p>
<p class="p3">We needed to do something about it.</p>
<p class="p3">『And we can’t break it?』</p>
<p class="p3">“No. It breaks, I die.”</p>
<p class="p3">『Huh? For real?』</p>
<p class="p3">“For real.”</p>
<p class="p3">Dang, that was close. And I was about to cut it apart.</p>
<p class="p3">『What can we do to end the contract?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Tear apart the contract document.”</p>
<p class="p3">『The contract document. Could this guy have it?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Un. I’ll look for it.”</p>
<p class="p3">Fran started to search the slave trader’s corpse.</p>
<p class="p3">But what if it’s not here? I mean, what if it’s hidden somewhere else?</p>
<p class="p3">But my worries were unnecessary.</p>
<p class="p3">“It’s here.”</p>
<p class="p3">Fran took out a sheaf of parchment from the slave trader’s breast pocket. One of those was Fran’s contract document.</p>
<p class="p3">Was this messy bundle what was forcing Fran into being a slave?</p>
<p class="p3">Dealing with this will free Fran.</p>
<p class="p3">『Let’s tear it apart!』</p>
<p class="p3">“Un!”</p>
<p class="p3">Fran clutched the bundle and grunted as she pulled it apart.</p>
<p class="p3">But it didn’t tear at all.</p>
<p class="p3">She tried time after time, but Fran couldn’t tear it apart with her strength alone.</p>
<p class="p3">“…I can’t.”</p>
<p class="p3">『Then let’s cut it. Put the contract on the ground.』</p>
<p class="p3">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p3">Fran lifted me above her head.</p>
<p class="p3">And swung me down with gusto.</p>
<p class="p3">『Nice! It worked!』</p>
<p class="p3">And right after the contracts were split in half:</p>
<p class="p3">Crack!</p>
<p class="p3">The slave collar fell off by itself.</p>
<p class="p3">『Whoooa! Do you feel okay?』</p>
<p class="p3">“I’m okay. No problem.”</p>
<p class="p3">I didn’t feel any mana coming from the slave collar. It looked like the contract was gone.</p>
<p class="p3">“Thanks.”</p>
<p class="p3">Whoooa. The cat girl is embarrassed! It was nice to see that.</p>
<p class="p3">But it was cute. And at a closer look, she was a pretty girl. After she grows up, she’ll attract the attention of everyone near her.</p>
<p class="p3">No way. I cannot allow that. If you want to date Flan, you’ll have to beat me first!</p>
<p class="p3">“Look at this.”</p>
<p class="p3">While I was getting angry by myself, Fran found something.</p>
<p class="p3">It was a pouch that the slave trader had.</p>
<p class="p3">『Is something in there?』</p>
<p class="p3">I looked inside. Yep, there were multiple things in there.</p>
<p class="p3">I first saw multiple coins. I didn’t know how the currency worked in this world so I had no idea how much this was worth, but they looked like silver and copper coins so they likely weren’t worth a lot.</p>
<p class="p3">And a few tools. Surprisingly, they looked like magical tools.</p>
<p class="p3">A torch magical tool that created fire. A water bottle that made drinkable water. A bracelet that gave a small boost to strength, and more.</p>
<p class="p3">They weren’t amazing, but they looked fun. The truth is, I wanted to use them but they wouldn’t work in this place because of the mana absorption.</p>
<p class="p3">I couldn’t calm down in this mana absorption area so I had her leave it.</p>
<p class="p3">『I don’t know how far the mana absorption extends to, but let’s leave the forest for now.』</p>
<p class="p3">“Okay.”</p>
<p class="p3">We left after she found a knife, cooking tools, clothes, and other useful looking things from the wagon. Of course, I stored the bear as well. I activated Dimensional Storage for a moment.</p>
<p class="p3">And Fran tied my blade to her back by using the cover of the wagon and the belt of the lackey.</p>
<p class="p3">Fran had a small build so I was very close to touching the ground. I needed to ask her to do something about that.</p>
<p class="p3">Also, because Fran had what were basically rags around her body, she put on some shabby clothes from the wagon. I suppose she changed from looking like a slave to looking like a street urchin.</p>
<p class="p3">『Then shall we go?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p3">Fran was surprised at the increase in her physical abilities that happened because she equipped me.</p>
<p class="p3">Fran was taken aback after we left the forest in less than thirty minutes.</p>
<p class="p3">“Amazing. Master is amazing.”</p>
<p class="p3">『Hahaha. Aren’t I?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p3">『Then what shall we do now? Do you have a destination in mind?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Uuun, there’s a town.”</p>
<p class="p3">『Near here?』</p>
<p class="p3">“That way.”</p>
<p class="p3">『So it’s that way but…do you know how far away it is?』</p>
<p class="p3">“Not really?”</p>
<p class="p3">Anyway, it seemed that she had heard by chance that the slave traders were taking them to the east. Because Fran had the Directional Sense skill, she was able to tell what direction she was going. And that is how the vague answer of ‘That way’ came about.</p>
<p class="p3">『Then let’s go that way.』</p>
<p class="p3">And so, we took off with the slight feeling that our journey was taking off.</p>
					
    < /br>

        
		<p>There was a delay with this update. Why? Because manga scanlations are a massive pain. I’ve started scanlating again and I’m damn glad I did. So while these updates will likely slow down as they already have, I’ll do my best to get these translations out as quickly as possible.</p>
<hr>
<p class="p1">I realized while on the way to the town that, because my Appraisal level went up, there was a little something added to my status window.</p>
<p class="p1">I gained the mysterious title, Mana Conductivity.</p>
<p class="p1">I asked Fran about it, but she didn’t know.</p>
<p class="p1">Does it increase my mana conducting efficiency? What does it do?</p>
<p class="p1">It also says that I’m an “A” but I had no way of knowing if that was good or bad.</p>
<p class="p1">Next, the way status displayed my skills changed.</p>
<p class="p1">I was able to categorize skills based on their type. So it became a little easier to look at my skills.</p>
<p class="p1">And it looked like, because I maxed out Fire Magic, I gained a bonus line in my status.</p>
<p class="p1">It was Superior Fire Skill.</p>
<p class="p1">After reaching level 10, the bonus changed a normal skill into a special, Superior one. It looked like it was excluded from Set Skills and only I was able to use it<span class="s1">—I couldn’t share it with Fran.</span></p>
<p class="p2">If I use ten or more Self-Evolution Points, I’ll need to choose how I use them carefully.</p>
<p class="p1">I also told Fran about myself while we were on the road. I didn’t have anything to hide from her. I’ll have to keep my mouth shut to hide this from others, though.</p>
<p class="p1">I told her about the fact that I used to be a human, that I grow by absorbing magic crystals, that I could share skills and raise her stats because she was my wielder, and more.</p>
<p class="p1">“Magic crystals…”</p>
<p class="p1">『That’s right. Well, it hasn’t been that long since I ranked up, so it’ll take a while.』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">『Ah, hey, what are you doing?』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">Clink clink.</p>
<p class="p1">Fran took the magic crystal from a Fanged Rat she found along the way and pressed it hard against my blade. She probably wanted me to absorb it. Though the way she was doing it was violent.</p>
<p class="p1">『Wait! I need to cut it! Put it against the edge!』</p>
<p class="p1">“Like this?”</p>
<p class="p1">『Yeah, exactly.』</p>
<p class="p1">“You really absorbed it.”</p>
<p class="p1">『That’s how I get stronger. We can sell their loot, so let’s also hunt a lot of demonic beasts.』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un. Okay.”</p>
<p class="p1">And after that, I tested out Telepathy. Since I was using it for the first time with Fran, there was still a lot of things I didn’t know.</p>
<p class="p1">It seemed like it created an area that made two-way communication possible. If I limited the skill to only connect to Fran, then I was able to talk privately with her. Also, I would likely be able to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>increase the range to let me talk to everyone in an area. We tested it out on a rabbit that Fran caught, and both Fran and the rabbit could hear my voice through Telepathy.</p>
<p class="p1">But Fran’s Telepathy didn’t reach the rabbit. It was probably so that others couldn’t use Telekinesis to communicate while excluding me. It was a skill meant to allow me to communicate with anyone from anywhere.</p>
<p class="p1">Our journey was progressing without a hitch.</p>
<p class="p1">The plains must have been a special environment because outside of the forest, there were no particularly strong demonic beasts. They were about the same as those in Area 2.</p>
<p class="p1">I did the cooking.</p>
<p class="p1">Because, back when I was going crazy, I improved my Cooking skill. I was able to use cooking tools without a problem because of Telekinesis, and I was also able to use ingredients. It was the easiest thing in the world for a sword like me to slice and peel things. I was easily able to make fire or water with magic.</p>
<p class="p1">The ingredients were the demonic beasts I had kept in my Dimensional Storage. I was able to tell which demonic beasts were edible, maybe thanks to the Cooking skill.</p>
<p class="p1">Fran could probably cook as well because she had the same skills as me, but…</p>
<p class="p1">I wanted to be in charge of the cooking. Because it was my duty as a guardian.</p>
<p class="p1">As a precaution, I equipped the skills Poison Resistance, Enhanced Absorption, Enhanced Digestion, Gluttony, and other skills like that. Gluttony was a skill that let the user gain strength from food after it’s absorbed. I had no way of knowing how much of an effect it would have, but it couldn’t hurt to have it equipped.</p>
<p class="p1">Fran’s status had changed to become like this. The shared skills we had in common didn’t show up.</p>
<p class="p1">Name: Fran Age: 12 years old</p>
<p class="p1">Race: Beastfolk. Black Cat</p>
<p class="p1">Job: None</p>
<p class="p1">Status: Slave</p>
<p class="p1">Lv: 3</p>
<p class="p1">HP: 39 MP: 25 Strength: 24 Agility: 46</p>
<p class="p1">Skills: Sword Wielding 1, Night Vision, Ability to Skin Prey, Directional Sense</p>
<p class="p1">Titles: Dismantling Master, Skill Collector, Flame Arts User, Cooking Master</p>
<p class="p1">Her status was overwhelmingly stronger than the goblins.</p>
<p class="p1">She was about equal to the demonic beasts in Area 3 or the Evil Goblins.</p>
<p class="p1">Thanks to Wielder Status Boost [small] that I acquired a while ago, each of her stats went up because of skills like Strength Boost [small].</p>
<p class="p1">I thought this ability was a cheat when she was only level 3. She would have no problem beating any low-rank monsters.</p>
<p class="p1">It’ll probably change based on the set skills, but I decided to always keep Sword Wielding, Fire Magic, and status boosting skills set.I also got used to changing the Set Skills. I could probably even change the Set Skills even during combat.</p>
<p class="p1">The problem was money.</p>
<p class="p1">I was told that the currency in this world is commonly called gold. But we got two silver coins and twenty-four copper coins from the slave trader. All together, it was two hundred twenty-four gold. I couldn’t tell if it was enough for a night at an inn or not; this conundrum could not be solved.</p>
<p class="p1">I called it a conundrum because Fran didn’t know the current prices in society. She probably only had a rough idea.</p>
<p class="p1">First, we needed to make money. So we can buy armor or the necessities for exploring.</p>
<p class="p1">I had a solution for now. The corpses of the demonic beasts I had put in my Dimensional Storage.</p>
<p class="p1">According to Fran, selling the loot from demonic beasts is explorers’ main source of income. I will likely make at least some money by selling the loot in my storage.</p>
<p class="p1">So, before storing them, I needed to dismantle them and sort out what loot was sellable.</p>
<p class="p1">But if a girl like Fran carried around the high rank demonic beasts’ loot, she might attract attention, so I planned to sell the less strong monsters’ loot first.</p>
<p class="p1">Well, this was all stuff I could figure out when we arrived at the town though.</p>
<p class="p1">『Great. That’s settled.』</p>
<p class="p1">We were currently camping out. Fran was dismantling the loot.</p>
<p class="p1">I realized this just a moment ago, but after being registered as my wielder, Fran had access to our shared skills even when I moved away from her. Her status boosts also stayed in effect. Even if I wasn’t right next to her, Fran could still use the Dismantle skill.</p>
<p class="p1">Fran, with a knife in one hand, was diligently dismantling the demonic beast’s corpse that she had laid down on the ground.</p>
<p class="p1">I was creating an odor-nullifying barrier to stop any demonic beasts from smelling the blood and coming here. Fran also put up a barrier herself. It seemed like she was getting skilled with magic skills in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p class="p1">I was preparing a meal for Fran. I made a stew with the pot and ingredients from the slave traders’ wagon and meat from the demonic beasts. I also added in the medicinal plants she had picked along the way so it was even perfectly nutritious. In addition, because of my Cooking 10, it tasted perfect<span class="s1">——I mean, it should taste perfect. It really was a shame that I couldn’t taste it.</span></p>
<p class="p2">We’ll likely share the work like this in the future, more or less.</p>
<p class="p2">With me cooking and keeping watch, and Fran being in charge of dismantling.</p>
<p class="p2">I ate the magic crystals, and Fran would either sell or eat everything besides that.</p>
<p class="p1">『Fran, all done.』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">『And of course, wash your hands.』</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> “</span>——Aqua Create.”</p>
<p class="p2">Fran washed her hands with the water she created. Mana-wise, this was no problem.</p>
<p class="p1">She could use my MP pool, so she could make as much water as she wanted without it being a problem.</p>
<p class="p1">『Are you finished dismantling?』</p>
<p class="p1">“More or less. But I couldn’t do that one.”</p>
<p class="p1">『Ahh, the tortoise.』</p>
<p class="p1">At the opposite end of Fran’s gaze was the Blast Turtle’s conspicuous corpse. Even with a dismantling skill of 10, it was impossible to cut through that hard shell with an ordinary knife.</p>
<p class="p1">Well, it is an evolved demonic beast, so it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p class="p1">Yesterday, she also couldn’t dismantle the Tyrant Saber-toothed Tiger. Mostly because of the tools.</p>
<p class="p1">『Looks like that’s up to me today as well.』</p>
<p class="p1">“Please.”</p>
<p class="p1">『Yeah. Leave it to me. Fran, eat.』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un. Thanks.”</p>
<p class="p1">I should hurry and dismantle it before Fran’s done.</p>
<p class="p1">It was three days after I met Fran.</p>
<p class="p1">We continued to walk with the town as our destination.</p>
<p class="p1">I was wrapped up in the wagon’s cover to not be noticed by others, and Fran kept me on her back. Because there was no excuse we could give if somebody saw me floating in the air.</p>

        </div>
        
<p class="p1">『Hey, can we enter the town without a problem?』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un?”</p>
<p class="p1">『I mean, is there an entry toll or some kind of identification card that we need?』</p>
<p class="p1">“Don’t know.”</p>
<p class="p1">Fran shook her head from side to side. Cute<span class="s1">——.</span></p>
<p class="p2">No, no. This wasn’t the time for that.</p>
<p class="p2">Fran had probably never gone through the entry procedures of entering a town because she was a slave. And thus, we had almost no information.</p>
<p class="p1">『We might be able to gain some more information if there was someone to ask.』</p>
<p class="p1">For the past three days of our journey, we had yet to find even a trace of other people.</p>
<p class="p1">But why was that? There weren’t any peddlers or travelers, let alone thieves.</p>
<p class="p1">“Because this isn’t a highway.”</p>
<p class="p1">『Huh? What do you mean?』</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> “</span>This is a side road split off from the highway.”</p>
<p class="p2">The slave traders probably crossed through that dangerous area full of demonic beasts to save some time.</p>
<p class="p2">And how unfortunate for them to meet their demise after being attacked.</p>
<p class="p2">If only they hadn’t dragged the slaves along with them.</p>
<p class="p1">『Huh? There’re highways?』</p>
<p class="p1">Though there was no way there would be a lot of people in that field infested with demonic beasts.</p>
<p class="p1">『Where is it?』</p>
<p class="p1">“It’ll show up soon if I keep going.”</p>
<p class="p1">『That’d be great.』</p>
<p class="p1">“It’ll be okay. Probably.”</p>
<p class="p1">And four hours passed.</p>
<p class="p1">During that time, we walked carefree, hunting rabbit-like animals or talking about what to spend Self-Evolution Points on next.</p>
<p class="p1">We discussed a variety of options, from increasing our skill levels to getting status boosting skills, but in the end we decided to acquire Nullify Senses and and Memory Increase .</p>
<p class="p1">Nullify Senses, as its name suggests, is a skill that blocks my target from sensing anything. According to Fran, talking swords are rare. So I acquired the skill to use in case of a difficult encounter.</p>
<p class="p1">Memory Increase  is a useful skill that increases the number of Set Skills I can have. Because one of our strong points was the diversity of our skills, increasing the number of skills we could set directly improved our combat ability. I needed to acquire it.</p>
<p class="p1">We continued talking about this looking good and that looking good until we discovered the long-awaited highway.</p>
<p class="p1">『Yes, it’s the road!』</p>
<p class="p1">It was a slightly better road than the beasts’ road that was just a path with the grass pulled out. But due to constant traffic, the ground was imprinted with wheel marks. That was without a doubt a road.</p>
<p class="p1">Thanks to Fran’s Directional Sense, we continued to walk towards the town.</p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, life form detected.”</p>
<p class="p1">『It doesn’t seem like a human.』</p>
<p class="p1">We were able to perceive the size and movements of our targets with the Sense Traces skill. I could tell that they were probably goblins, as I had sensed them multiple times before.</p>

<p class="p1"><b> </b>“Get them?”</p>
<p class="p1">『For now, anyway. I don’t know if we can sell their loot, but I can absorb their magic crystals.』</p>
<p class="p1">“Okay.”</p>
<p class="p1">Fran nodded her head, and she ran off the highway.</p>
<p class="p1">Because I already equipped combat boosting skills, she ran between the trees like the wind.</p>
<p class="p1">“They’re there.”</p>
<p class="p1">The goblins hid themselves in the forest that was at the edge of the highway. They were likely waiting for someone to come along the road.</p>
<p class="p1">There were three of them.</p>
<p class="p1">Fran crept up silently behind the goblins and attacked them.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hup.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Keek?”</p>
<p class="p1">The one that Fran had slashed stood unsteadily on its feet then collapsed.</p>
<p class="p1">“Haagh!”</p>
<p class="p1">She felled the two remaining goblins with the sword after taking it out of the goblin’s corpse. She had become faster with her techniques because she had grown more accustomed to the skills.</p>
<p class="p1">The goblins likely hadn’t even realized anything was wrong with their bodies.</p>
<p class="p1">Because the fight was over before the first goblin’s body had even hit the ground.</p>
<p class="p1">“Master, the rest is yours.”</p>
<p class="p1">『Yeah, leave it to me.』</p>
<p class="p1">After I absorbed their magic crystals, I cut off the goblins’ horns, the only usable loot on them. Fran told me that she had heard that once.</p>
<p class="p1">It was dangerous to leave the corpses near the highway as they could attract large demonic beasts, so I put them in my Dimensional Storage.</p>
<p class="p1">“Master, there’re goblins over there.”</p>
<p class="p1">『More of them?』</p>
<p class="p1">“What shall we do?”</p>
<p class="p1">『We have to go that way anyway, so want to get rid of them?』</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">Fran once again ran at them. But once she ran forward, a completely unexpected sight entered our vision.</p>
<p class="p1">“Shit! Go away, you damn goblins!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Kikiki.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Gururuah.”</p>
<p class="p1">A wagon was being attacked by the goblins.</p>
<p class="p1">There were six of them. While there appeared to only be one person on the wagon.</p>
<p class="p1">『The goblins again, really?』</p>
<p class="p1">“I want to help.”</p>
<p class="p1">『Got it. Do your best.』</p>
<p class="p1">She once again launched a silent sneak attack from behind.</p>
<p class="p1">She sliced three of them with Sword Technique: Triple Thrust. Though it was weak as a swift trio of stabs would be expected to be, it was more than enough against the goblins.</p>
<p class="p1">“I-I’m saved!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Kiii!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Shut up.”</p>
<p class="p1">The goblins sensed the threat that Fran’s sudden appearance posed. But Fran cut them down without mercy.</p>
<p class="p1">The sole remaining goblin turned to run away, but Fran threw me at it, killing it.</p>
<p class="p1">Thanks to the Throwing skill, I had cut clean through its stomach. I had planned on secretly changing my trajectory if the throw was off, but there was no need for that.</p>
<p class="p1">“Th-thank you, young lady. You saved me.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">“But you sure are strong. Are you here by yourself?”</p>
<p class="p1">“……”</p>
<p class="p1">“No, you don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to.”</p>
<p class="p1">Though Fran was simply not talkative, he must have mistaken her behavior for her not wanting to talk.</p>
<p class="p1">The truth was, I was glad that she didn’t rashly give him information. Deciding to allow this misunderstanding about Fran to stand, I gave Fran instructions with Telepathy.</p>
<p class="p1">‘Okay.’</p>
<p class="p1">“Um, if it’s okay with you, would you like to ride on my wagon? You’re going to Alessa, right?”</p>
<p class="p1">It seemed that the name of our destination is Alessa.</p>
<p class="p1">But this man; he looked weak, but he wasn’t a fool.</p>
<p class="p1">He may have offered a ride to his savior, Fran, out of the goodness of his heart to repay her for saving him from the goblins, but he also wanted her to act as his escort.</p>
<p class="p1">We needed information anyway, so we decided to take up his offer. But of course, the debt for saving his life wasn’t that cheap.</p>
<p class="p1">I told Fran what to say.</p>
<p class="p1">“We’ll escort you up to the town.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, yeah, please do.”</p>
<p class="p1">Hmph. There was a bitter smile on his face.</p>
<p class="p1">“We will escort you for free in exchange for the information we want.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Hahahaha. This is fun. I like it! Get on.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Un.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m Randel. And you?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Fran.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Then I hope our travels go well, Fran-san.”</p>
<p class="p1">We didn’t forget to collect the goblins’ horns before we left.</p>

        <h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p><br>
Where am I?<br>
<br>
I woke, and the first thing that came to my eyes was a beautiful sight. The gloomy sky stretched as far as the horizon. Light shines through the deep water like an halo. The sun is about to rise. The view of the sunrise from the top of a high mountain glittered like a rainbow, and I was thoroughly impressed.<br>
<br>
The moon is setting on the other side of the horizon. A huge silver disk that I didn’t see. It’s top is disappearing on the other side of the horizon right now.<br>
<br>
It’s an overwhelming scene. I have lived for 30 years and I haven’t seen such a beautiful scene. It’s strange that I don’t cry. <br>
<br>
No wait. I lived for 30 years? Am I still alive? I mean, I’m dead?<br>
<br>
The scene I saw last, was a bright red convertible that was in bad taste. The man in the driver seat had a smartphone in one hand, thinking about the day after tomorrow, and a laugh like a horse.<br>
<br>
Yes, even while driving. He laughed happily. But I didn’t have fun at all this fucking bastard!<br>
<br>
And so, I remembered so much my heart cried… …. I should be dead. No, I’m dead?<br>
<br>
『U-mu. What is that thing?』<br>
『So. Are you finally awake?』<br>
『Uo! Who is it?』<br>
<br>
Suddenly a voice sounded. The figure isn’t seen in the surrounding area. No, doesn’t it echo in my head?<br>
<br>
『It’s going to be hard, so hang in there.』<br>
『Eh? EH?』<br>
『Well, see you ar-』<br>
<br>
Then, I couldn’t hear the man’s voice anymore.<br>
<br>
『Eh? Hell-o?』<br>
<br>
I called out, but there wasn’t any answer. Just what was that? Auditory hallucination? But I heard it clearly… ….<br>
<br>
Then, in order to look at the surrounding area, I tried to move.<br>
<br>
My body doesn’t move.<br>
<br>
『Oof? But Why? Or rather, what was I?』<br>
<br>
I thought I was tied up, but it doesn’t seem that simple.<br>
<br>
My body feels strange. First I don’t have any feeling in my hands and feet. No, in the first place, everything besides them feel strange.<br>
 </p>

<p>『No eyelids. Eyes… …. If I can’t feel my eyes, how can I see?』<br>
<br>
I looked down at my body. I was a little uneasy, but I could move my gaze.<br>
<br>
『... … It’s a sword.』<br>
<br>
In my line of sight, lodged inside a pedestal, was a sword.<br>
<br>
For some reason, my body is a sword, and I understand it is natural. The situation is beyond the scope of understanding. But even so, if a sword = myself, without a doubt, I understood it.<br>
<br>
Eyes――ish thing, is in the sword’s foundation.<br>
<br>
『I died… … and reincarnated as a sword?』<br>
<br>
What second-rate light novel is this. I want to think that this is a dream, but I can’t pinch my cheeks with this body.<br>
<br>
『For the time being, a sense of skin?There’s something like that.』<br>
<br>
My body is a blade, that pierces the pedestal beneath it, is something I understood. It was different from the feeling of touching skin, but there was some feeling of touch.<br>
<br>
『Another world?』<br>
<br>
That much is certain.</p>

<p>Anyways, the sun and the moon are out at the same time. It isn’t the huge silver moon that set a moment ago, it’s a smaller moon. Besides, red, blue, green, purple and yellow, pink, there are six more moons that sparkle in the sky.<br>
<br>
『Usually, when it’s a light novel of a different world reincarnation thing, there’s usually a cheat ability.』<br>
<br>
Would I who reincarnated as a sword, in the first place be able to handle a skill?</p>

<p>『The classic reincarnation cheat is appraisal but… … . Oh, seriously? 』<br>
<br>
Somehow there seems to have been a convenient development in our circumstances.<br>
<br>
I was safely able to confirm my status.</p>

<p>Name: Unknown<br>
<br>
Wielder Registrant: None<br>
<br>
Race: Intelligent Weapon<br>
<br>
Attack:132 Mana: 200/200 Durability:100/100<br>
<br>
Skills<br>
<br>
Appraisal: Lv6, Self-Repair, Self-Evolving, Self-Modifying, Telekinesis, Telepathy, Wielder Status Small Boost, Wielder Recovery Small Boost, Skill Sharing, Magician.<br>
<br>
Something like that, seems amazing.<br>
<br>
Appraisal: Lv6: Information on what I see, is displayed.<br>
<br>
Self-Repair: It repairs damage done to the weapon automatically. Unless it’s been completely destroyed, reconstruction is possible.<br>
<br>
Self-Evolution: Despite being a weapon, it has various evolutions.<br>
<br>
Self-Modification: Alters oneself, and optimizes it.<br>
<br>
Telekinesis: Using magic, one can manipulate an object without using my body.<br>
<br>
Telepathy: Using magic, one can speak to another person’s mind. Bypassing language, mutual understanding is possible.<br>
<br>
Wielder Status Small Boost: All states of the wielder are increased by 5.<br>
<br>
Wielder Recovery Small Boost: HP, MP, Stamina, and Magical Power recovery rate is boosted by 20%.<br>
<br>
Skill Share: With the registered wielder, it’s possible to give them a skill.<br>
<br>
Magician: Feel the flow of magic. Proof of a Magician.</p>

        </div>
        

<p>I might be really amazing? At the least, I’m not an ordinary weapon. I might have the ability to be classified as a rare or unique weapon. However, why is my name unknown? Is appraisal too low leveled or is it not from the original? <br>
<br>
Well, I don’t understand it too well, but it’s fine for now.<br>
<br>
Next is to check my appearance. My blade is a mysterious white metal that shines, with a blue line, and even at a first look it’s very beautiful. <br>
<br>
The muted hues of the elegant golden guard has a carving of a brave wolf on it, and a red oriental ribbon. On the handle, in red and white braid, a lattice pattern has been woven.<br>
<br>
But that’s self praise, but no matter how you look at it, it’s not a ordinary mass-produced item. I think the sword is of considerable value. But, I don’t know how strong an attack power of 132 is. The possibility that the sword is just some very expensive ornament isn’t zero. However, because of the skills, I don’t think that’s so.<br>
<br>
If I was, that would be the worst. If I was just some rich sword, I would plunge myself into a hearth and probably die (?).<br>
<br>
However, it is a gorgeous sword. If this was an RPG, it would be the equivalent of the appearance of a mysterious figure.<br>
<br>
『But, it’s only a sword.』<br>
<br>
In my mind, I made a sigh.</p>

<p>It doesn’t meant that I was good looking when I was alive. That being said, I wasn’t ugly enough to stand out. I was a minor character that was everywhere. So, I don’t have any lingering attraction my body when I was alive. Rather, even after reincarnating, I didn’t have any complaints. Instead, it was my wish to change.<br>
<br>
That said, I wouldn’t be a sword. Sword.<br>
<br>
Now, I can’t eat food or play games either. I can’t even get rid of my virginity.<br>
<br>
Is, is that so. If it’s me the fact that I’m a sage is decided! Another life where I must live carrying this burden.<br>
<br>
『……』<br>
<br>
I despair. If I had arms and legs I would be throwing the down to the ground in sadness.<br>
[T/N:Think ｏｒｚ]<br>
I mean, the magician skill, is it that sort of thing? Which reminds me. Only that skill is a different color than the others, but it feels different… ... Stop fucking with me! Don’t laugh!<br>
<br>
How long was I feeling depressed for, even I don’t know. Was it 5 minutes or 1 hour? During the time that I was stunned, it seems it became something silly..<br>
<br>
『Now because I’m a sword, do I need to worry about such a thing? Anyhow, I’m a sword.』<br>
<br>
Besides, if I didn’t reincarnate, I would have died on the spot. When thinking about it carefully, I might actually be quite lucky. Even though I died, I am still able to be conscious in this way.<br>
<br>
That sounds right to me. Not everyone has the experience of becoming a sword. If I don’t have fun, isn’t that a failure?<br>
<br>
If that’s what I believe, I think I’ve made a breakthrough. Isn’t that not escapism?<br>
<br>
An unexpected second life. Well, a sword life. I might as well aim for the summit of sword. It might be better that way.<br>
<br>
What’s the top as a sword? Well, having someone use me is most important, I’m out of the question. For example. A hero? But the sword of a hero goes through many hardships. I would fight against the demon lord. Depending on the situation I might get broken. That means in the end I would need the teacher of a legendary blacksmith to repair me. Also, the hero might be a fool spouting about justice with hot defined muscles. Probably a handsome guy. The exact opposite of me. To be honest, I don’t think we would get along well.<br>
<br>
I might as well be used by a woman. It’s best if she’s pretty, nor should she be clumsy. That’s several levels better than a muscle-headed hero.<br>
<br>
After that, her skill with a sword. A brilliant swordsman, using me to mow down enemies, and becoming a hero. And that beloved sword is recorded inside textbooks several hundred years later.<br>
<br>
… … Well, if it’s just a dream it’s easy if I’m just saying it. Do I need to make a major compromise? For now, let leave this plain.<br>
<br>
I can’t hear the man’s voice at all, so I guess I’ll leave.</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <p>2 I Can Fly</p>

<hr>
<p>Now, first let’s check the surrounding area first.<br>
<br>
First, I’m in what appears look like an old ruin. Without a roof in the vast empty plain, I stand alone. If it’s seen from a distance, it might be mistaken for a larger water fountain.<br>
<br>
As for me, the pedestal was set in the center, with this treasured sword stuck into it. What about that? Is it legendary sword that is given to those that reach it? Since, the surroundings don’t feel like a dungeon.<br>
<br>
Because of the pedestal it’s not possible to turn around, I can’t see anything behind me. But, as far as the eye can see, there weren’t any tall trees, just bushes and shrubs. If I look closely, there’s an occasional shadow. I wonder if it’s an animal. <br>
<br>
『Not a single person to be found.』<br>
<br>
I can’t move myself?<br>
<br>
Wait a second, if I’m not mistaken, there should be a telekinetic skill. Maybe, I can move with it?<br>
<br>
『Mun.』<br>
<br>
Concentrate. Telekinesis Telekinesis.<br>
<br>
<br>
Suddenly, I think I felt my body get lighter. There’s a feeling that the sword slightly separated from the pedestal. The most important thing, is to imagine the sword flying through the air.<br>
<br>
『Ooo! I floated!』<br>
<br>
If I can imagine it, it’s easy. After I escaped the pedestal, I could move free through the air.<br>
<br>
『I can fly!』<br>
[T/N: This is said in Engrish. Hence the title.]<br>
<br>
There isn’t much speed, but it’s enough for now. I became clear that I could move on my own.<br>
<br>
I tried moving around the area near the pedestal. As before, it looks like a ruin. I think the bricks are made of light brown blocks. Exposed to wind and rain for many years, the color has darkened, and moss covers patches here and there.<br>
<br>
The area’s diameter is 20 meters across.<br>
<br>
『Who on Earth built this. I feel like it’s the person who made me… … 』<br>
<br>
This is very worn out, I wonder if I was also left here for so long? <br>
<br>
Even if I said sword reincarnation, a sword can’t be made from nothing. It should be expected that somebody made my body. Well, if my body didn’t transform into a sword, but.<br>
<br>
The maker would be the first person to use me, unless the producer is dead then the possibility of that disappears.<br>
<br>
But my body, the sword, is free of moss and dust. It’s just like someone just put me here only yesterday.<br>
<br>
I was thinking about various things while observing my surroundings, when a feeling of unease ran through my body.<br>
<br>
『…… Huh?』<br>
<br>
Somehow, tired… … The sensation of losing all my strength attacks the sword.<br>
<br>
And, I fell.<br>
<br>
『Seriously?』<br>
<br>
I try to use telekinesis desperately, but it doesn’t react at all. Height, I estimated 10 meters.<br>
<br>
『Float! Please float!』<br>
<br>
But, struggling was useless as I hit the ground with all of my might.<br>
<br>
Gaii~i~i~in! called a great resounding metal sound.<br>
<br>
『Eee… … Isn’t it broken somewhere? Some cracks or』<br>
 </p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>I hurriedly looked at the status of my body, but everything seemed fine. Also, my body doesn’t feel strange anywhere. To fall from that height and end up fine, this might be an amazing sword after all.<br>
<br>
『But, why did I fall?』<br>
<br>
A feeling like fatigue came to be, and I couldn’t use telekinesis anymore.<br>
<br>
In order to find the reason, I check my status.<br>
<br>
I immediately understood the reason.<br>
<br>
『You no longer possess any magic.』<br>
<br>
It was Possessed Magic: 0/200. Probably, when using telekinesis, magic will be continually drained. The fatigue is probably caused by this. Even when the magic is cut off, my saving grace must be that we don’t lose consciousness.<br>
<br>
『I didn’t fly for 5 minutes. It was probably around 3 minutes.』<br>
<br>
For a moment I waited on the stone road. Then, my magic recovered slightly. It appears that it restores itself 1 per 1 minute. I restored it to 60 after waiting for an hour, and was able to use telekinesis once more.<br>
<br>
『Alright, I float.』<br>
<br>
I don’t seem to have any problems. I checked my status as it is. My magic is decreasing rather intensely.<br>
<br>
『While I use telekinesis, the consumption is 1 per 1 second? Then, after calculations it’s about 200 for 3 minutes.』<br>
<br>
Also it’s unbearable to be slammed into the ground. I, before I lost all my magic, returned to the pedestal in a hurry. After I am embedded in the pedestal, it’s strangely calming.<br>
<br>
『Fuu. Would I be able to return to this.』<br>
<br>
But, I was unskilled at movement and I understood that it would be dangerous. For a little while, I’ll avoid leaving the pedestal’s perimeter, and observe the plain.<br>
<br>
When looking at the plain, a variety of creatures can be seen. Like the savannahs of Earth, contrary to my expectations it wasn’t only mammals, there was something that looked exactly like a bug, and some guys without a definite shape.<br>
<br>
For example, the ant-like thing I saw earlier had the shadow the size of a small dog.<br>
<br>
The sword was fine. At least, it looks to me like there’s no need to attack.<br>
<br>
『Again, this isn’t Earth.』<br>
<br>
Moreover, if I look in the distance, there were shadows of even larger beasts. Although it’s only a rough eye measurement, it looks to be around 10 meters. At least, I think it’s that big.<br>
<br>
『Is it the so-called evil beasts?』<br>
<br>
I saw them, and there was 1 that worried me.<br>
<br>
『With such a evil beast here, would it be possible for a human to reach here?』</p>

        <p>Chapter 3 – Encounter with goblins!<br>
 </p>

<p>Day 2 of resurrection.</p>

<p>Something has come.</p>

<p>Footsteps are approaching from behind the pedestal.<br>
It’s sounds like more than one also.</p>

<p>「Gehegehahu」<br>
「Agiyagiyo」<br>
「Gegiya!」</p>

<p>Conversation? Are they talking? I don’t know the meaning, but it seems they are communicating.</p>

<p>Judging from the voice, I get the feeling that they are monkeys.</p>

<p>The presence gets closer.<br>
Already right behind.</p>

<p>Okay, come here a little bit more.<br>
Then i will know its form.</p>

<p>zazza</p>

<p>A little more.</p>

<p>ZAZZAZZA</p>

<p>One meter more.</p>

<p>ZAZZA – -pita</p>

<p>Damn it.<br>
It stopped right behind me.</p>

<p>「giyagiyu」<br>
「giyarugaga」<br>
「giyanga?」<br>
「guruhaa-」</p>

<p>What is it? What the hell are you saying? It sounds like a discussion…. ((Not 100% on the last part))</p>

<p>And, something, just touched my handle!<br>
Clearly, the handle is grasped.<br>
Although it is similar, I feel that it is too stiff to be the touch of a human hand.</p>

<p>It seems to be trying to remove me from the pedestal.</p>

<p>I felt a feeling of strange resistance as the form that did not understand who i was picked me up. ((*Needs to be checked later*))<br>
How should i say it, the form should be confirmed… after it can be omitted separately… ((*Not 100%*))</p>

<p>Somehow, i resisted it using telekinesis.<br>
The mystery partner puts more power in, after failing to remove me the first time.</p>

<p>But it is naive.<br>
It is resisted with all my power.<br>
Like hell i will let it pull me out.</p>

<p>「GYAGYA!」<br>
「GYUGAGAGA….!」<br>
「HAGAHAFU!」</p>

<p>In order to support their companion, the others begin shouting.<br>
As i try to force myself in, the challenger beings to skirt around the pedestal to remove me .</p>

<p>「Giyaruga!」<br>
「Gorugiyaru!」</p>

<p>Because of that, these guys worked their way perfecting into my sights.</p>

<p>Are you serious.</p>

<p>Green skin.<br>
The brutal and more like a gorilla ugly face.<br>
A head with short horns, wielding clubs and wearing furs. ((May just be furry))</p>

<p>So, the guy really was just a goblin.</p>

<p>Goblins tried to remove me.</p>

<p>Wait! wait, not Goblins! If i become a magic sword used by goblins it’s over.<br>
If it was a Goblin King at least, it was good. Even if its seen, how is it a Goblin Grunt?!</p>

<p>While resisting with telekinesis, i tried verifying the status of the two that entered my sight.</p>

<p>Race: Goblin: Evil: Demon Beast Lv5<br>
Hp: 17 MP: 5 Physical Strength: 8 Endurance: 11 agility: 12 intelligence: 6 Magic: 3 dexterity: 7<br>

<p>Ho-ho i see.<br>
Even though the are from the same race they are subtly different.<br>
Well, yea..<br>
When the weapons are different, of course they will be different.</p>

<p>Another one gets impatient with me not coming out easily and has come around to the front so i appraised it.</p>

<p>Race: Goblin Leader: Evil: Demon Beast Lv2<br>
Hp: 24 MP: 6 Physical Strength: 11 Endurance: 15 agility: 13 intelligence: 7 magic: 7 dexterity: 7<br>
Skills<br>
Swordplay :Lv1, Art of Survival :Lv1, Dismantling :Lv2, Leadership :Lv1</p>

<p>This guy is a Goblin Leader.<br>
The level is low though, Is it a race effect or possibly evolution? It seems a little strong.<br>
Although only a little bit really.</p>

<p>What to do.</p>

<p>There are no signs that they will leave.<br>
In order to somehow remove me, this time it started hitting me.</p>

<p>Still when it finds that useless, it’s time for a substitution.<br>
Apparently, one was still in my blind spot and it grabbed onto me.<br>
「Huuuuunnnnnn」I put power in desperately while making a painful voice!</p>

<p>Maximum power resistance.</p>

<p>When it realized it was impossible with its power the leader borrowed the goblin companions club and starts hitting more with that.<br>
With its face dyed in anger it starts going wild with displeasure at not being able to remove me.</p>

<p>After all, it is a goblin.<br>
It’s behavior is too stupid.</p>

<p>While it was a struggle to the goblin, the pain and confusion caused it to kick the pedestal.<br>
But the pedestal seems to be more solid than expected.<br>
Holding onto its toe, it is jumping up and down comically.</p>

<p>Ku Ku Ku.<br>
Serves him right.</p>

<p>The leader which was in my blind spot, in a state of anger hurled the club at one of the other goblins.<br>
Hey wait a minute, aren’t they friends?</p>

<p>What a thought, Goblin bastard. ((* Really hard line but i think its close*))<br>
Surprisingly, it began to spit at me!<br>
I can feel its dirty saliva on my blade.</p>

<p>Ah! Really -! I feel really bad! The humiliation.<br>
Ok, i see, It’s war.<br>
I will do it!</p>

<p>The first target is this guy before my eyes.</p>

<p>I changed into a goblin leader, and i took aim at the goblin that knows swordplay.<br>
I measure the timing and stop resisting with telekinesis.</p>

<p>SUPPON~ (Boing)</p>

<p>The sword which lost resistance suddenly is pulled up plainly by a goblin.<br>
the goblin which used to much force lost its balance and fell on its backside.</p>

<p>A fool.<br>
it’s full of openings!</p>

<p>Using telekinesis, i casually move the blade.<br>
The blade plainly cut the windpipe of the defenseless goblin</p>

<p>I faked an accident, and one was defeated.</p>

<p>Not being able to understand the situation, The ones who stayed rushed up to him.<br>
There! , I exploded in action using a ram attack.</p>

<p>Well, its a sword so the ram attack = Finisher.</p>

<p>As usual practice during a quarrel, I beat the strong guy first.<br>
It is the goblin leader that was targeted.</p>

<p>Not expecting the sword to move automatically, of course he couldn’t avoid my ram attack.</p>

        </div>
        

<p>I look down at my sword blade which penetrated to the back through the stomach in utter amazement.</p>

<p>A sly trick.</p>

<p>I fall down to the ground just as is.<br>
two more.</p>

<p>To my surprise , is it the first person? For murder, it didn’t feel uncomfortable.<br>
I wonder if its thanks to having the body of the sword.<br>
The feel which stops a foe, tears it, and opens its interior also didn’t feel unpleasant at all.<br>
Rather the mood is in high spirits.</p>

<p>Hyahaha, It is meat! I can’t help it.</p>

<p>However, About cutting down a partner, there was no feeling of evasion at all.<br>
On the contrary, there is a strange sense of fulfilment.<br>
It may be the feeling of satisfaction that came from being a sword.</p>

<p>I attacked one of them that turned his back and was going to start running, and buried it with a single blow.</p>

<p>The other one is scared and unable to stand up.<br>
It was easy to bury it.</p>

<p>Race: Goblin: Evil: Demon beast Lv2<br>
Hp: 12 MP: 9 Physical Strength: 7 Endurance: 11 agility: 10 intelligence: 6 magic: 3 dexterity: 8<br>
Skills<br>
Swordplay: Lv1 『Kobold Killer』</p>

<p>But, Good for me.<br>
Despite being a surprise attack, they were all killed in a single blow.<br>
Attack power 132 is not for show.<br>
Well, I don’t know whether it is strong, but with goblins as the standard it seems to be.</p>

<p>However, there is one thing I’m concerned about.</p>

<p>「Was i just sparkling?」</p>

<p>When i dealt the fatal blow to the third or fourth goblin, the sword blade emitted light for a moment.<br>
To tell the truth, When i killed the second one i felt like the air around me shone also.<br>
I think it was my imagination though.<br>
Maybe it wasn’t just my imagination?</p>

<p>But i think i didn’t shine when i killed the first one.<br>
Well, there don’t seem to be any abnormalities, but lets check 『Status』first of all.</p>

<p>Name: Unknown<br>
Race: Intelligence Weapon<br>
Attack power: 132 Magic power: 166/200 Durability : 100/100<br>
Skills<br>
Appraisal: Lv6 ・Self-Recovery rank 1 ・ Demon stone value 3/100・「Grade 10」, Self-modification, Telekinesis, Telepathic communication, Small rise in owner status, Small rise in owner recovery, Skill sharing, Magician<br>
Set skill<br>
Unavailable<br>
Memory skill<br>
Digging: Lv1〈New〉, Dismantling：Lv1〈New, Swordplay：Lv1〈New〉Club technique: Lv1〈New〉,Leadership：Lv1〈New〉, Art of survival：Lv1〈New〉, Kobold Killer 〈New〉</p>

<p>What!? The items in my status increased.<br>
The first thing i noticed is Self-Evolution.</p>

<p>Self-evolution &lt;rank 1. Demon stone level 3/100, Grade 10&gt; ((*This needs added above accidently wrote Self-recovery instead of evolution*))</p>

<p>Rank 1? will self-evolution include something like level?<br>
And, there is a demon stone level.<br>
With 3 / 100.<br>
Ah! The sparkling three times.<br>
Which is also the level on demon stone 3/100<br>
Are they connected with each other? And Grade? I don’t know what this means either.<br>
Just, It was added after it, If I’m not mistaken it will be connected to the grade.</p>

<p>Did i get the skills when i flashed after killing the Goblins?<br>
One of the beat goblins had it in the first place. Viligance is not visable so i think its certain. ((*Okay so this needs cleaned. He suddenly jumped to talking about the other skills and how he did not get the vigilance skill because the first goblin he killed had it and he didn’t flash when it died.*))</p>

<p>Did i absorb the goblins skills?</p>

<p>When i select a skill, Something like information resounded.</p>

<p>The current remaining memory is 10. ((* Okay so i think i got it, when i used Grade 10 instead of grade it is supposed to possibly be memory so he can only maybe only have 10 skills at a time?*))<br>
Set a skill? 『Yes/No』</p>

<p>Of course its 『Yes』.<br>
Then i entered into a skill choice screen.<br>
I choose them from the top down.</p>

<p>Set Skill<br>
Digging Lv1, Dismantling Lv1, Swordplay Lv1, Club Technique Lv1, Leadership Lv1, Art of Survival Lv1, Kobold Killer.<br>
Memory Skills<br>
None</p>

<p>It changed!<br>
Could it be set? It isn’t understood well.</p>

<p>When saying that it isn’t understood well, it is a standard to shine.<br>
Why didn’t i shine after the first kill? There is a hint, The level of Demon stones 3/100.</p>

<p>Demon Stone.<br>
It is a word often heard in the stories involving summonings to a different world.<br>
It is a crystal filled with magic that is in the bodies of Demon beasts.<br>
As i imagined, however.</p>

<p>When you refer to the different methods of killing the goblins one of them was cut in the throat while the others were pushed through.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is the difference.</p>

<p>「Hmm.<br>
Try it out?」</p>

<p>I rushed over to the goblin i first deafeated.<br>
I set the blade in the stiff who fell down to the fullest.</p>

<p>It is an act that degrades a corpse, but it is for the sake of inspection.<br>
Forgive me.</p>

<p>The third time i seemed to get the desired reaction.<br>
With a slight firm touch, the sword blade glittered.</p>

<p>When the demon stone is pierced as expected, it seems im able to absorb its magic or something.<br>
The demon stone of a goblin seems to be in its stomach.</p>

<p>The demon stone levels increased to 4/100, in memory skill column, Vigilance and poison-resistance were added.</p>

<p>Paying attention , the skills level is different this time.<br>
The Goblin leader had Dismantling Lv2 and one of the underlings had Digging Lv2<br>
But the skill you can get seems to be Lv1<br>
Somehow, it was like a level reset.</p>

<p>Is it possible to level up these skills?<br>
Is it by using it? or should i take in a demon stone? Inspection was necessary in the future.</p>

<p>No matter how, I’ll set the Vigilance and Poison-resistance skills.<br>
.</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <p>—————–</p>

<p>Um.<br>
The goblin corpses are a nuisance.<br>
Having fallen in front of the pedestal, they are now constantly in sight.</p>

<p>I went out of the ruins while dragging the corpses using telekinesis.<br>
It left traces of their blood on the ground, but its better than their dead bodies.</p>

<p>Then dug a hole to bury the dead.<br>
(Now to dig a hole to bury the dead) I hope that the hole digging skill i just got works.</p>

<p>Un.<br>
I can dig it.<br>
It can be dug noisily with a “zakuzaku” by the thin sword blade. (zakuzaku = crunching sound)<br>
It seems like I’m even using a shovel.<br>
However does the digging skill contribute to it, or is it simply thanks to telekinesis, could not be determined.<br>
Probably, i want to think that there was some effect.</p>

<p>Well, it is good to have been able to collect skills while waiting for a suitable person to come.<br>
Maybe that’s what i should aim to do while waiting. Become stronger as a magic sword.</p>

<p>And with that decided, i started to search immediately.<br>
Using telekinesis, i jump around the ruins.<br>
When my magic power decreases, i land and take a rest.</p>

<p>Because the surroundings are a plain, even if i go far away, I’m a little relieved to not lose sight of the pedestal.</p>

<p>The one found first was a little mouse with six legs.</p>

<p>『Promptly,<br>
I appraised it.』</p>

<p>Name: Six-legged rat : animal Lv1<br>
Hp:2<br>
Mp: 0 Strength: 1 Endurance: 1 agility: 10 Int: 2 Magic: 0 Dexterity: 3. Skills<br>
None</p>

<p>Weak.<br>
Too Weak.<br>
There isn’t even any skills too.<br>
However, i am all right with just being able to absorb its magic stone.<br>
The current magic stone level is 4/100<br>
After gathering 96 more i expect that my rank will go up.<br>
Please die for my growth.</p>

<p>I nose-dived at the mouse.<br>
My attack easily hits the unsuspecting mouse.<br>
The mouse split in two.</p>

<p>However, my body does not shine.</p>

<p>『Oh, why is that?』</p>

<p>Once again, the blade pierced the dead mouse.<br>
But i still do not shine.<br>
Was i not able to take in the magic stone by the present attack?</p>

<p>I opened up the body of the mouse carefully to investigate a cause.<br>
It’s quite a grotesque site, but i was saved thanks to being a sword.<br>
It is gross, but i don’t need to vomit.<br>
I think whether I feel slightly sorry.<br>
(Should i kill myself now.) As a result of the investigation, i could not find traces of a magic stone within the mouse’s body.<br>
Then, i noticed.<br>
When i confirmed the status of this mouse, it was transcribed as an animal.<br>
Isn’t it that only demon’s have a magic stone inside if them?<br>
Even on earth, animals don’t have such a thing inside themselves.</p>

<p>To inspect this theory, i have become the rats worst nightmare and attacked all that i could find.<br>
The result, After killing three more, i could not find a magic stone.</p>

<p>Next i aim at Demon beasts.<br>
Well, One was found already.<br>
It’s a large centipede approximately 50 centimeters long which has been eating the bodies of dead rats which i had killed.</p>

<p>Name: Giant Centipede : Demon bug: Demon Beast : Lv4<br>
Hp : 18 MP : 7 Strength : 6 Endurance : 10 Agility : 14 Intelligence : 1 Magic : 6 Dexterity : 2<br>
Skills<br>
Vibration sensing : Lv1 , Climbing : Lv1 , Poison fang.</p>

<p>The family is a demon beast. ***(I feel dumb, sorry guys seems demon beast may have been magic beast, but I’m conflicted because they are still demons. so i might just keep calling them demon beasts)***<br>
At first i pierced the head.<br>
However, it struggles, it rampages.<br>
A yellow liquid seeps out of its mouth, “BitanBitan” while thrashing around.<br>
To put and end to it, i cut up the body this time.<br>
Still the divided large centipede moves back and forth showing the vitality peculiar to an insect.</p>

<p>But soon its wriggling stopped. A〜, Its disgusting.</p>

<p>However, he was defeated.<br>
My sword blade glittered when i cut through the area around the centipedes heart which had stopped moving.<br>
As expected, the demon beast seemed to have a magic stone.</p>

<p>Skills gained by the way, was the vibration sensing :Lv1 Climbing: Lv1 and poison fang.<br>
But i don’t have fangs….<br>
When i set it and used it, my MP decreased by 5, and a liquid delicately seeped out from my blade.<br>
This is probably poison.<br>
Oh, If it can be used, that’s fine!</p>

<p>Next i tried to set climbing and set vibration sensing, but wasn’t able to do it.</p>

<p>(Beyond the upper limit of the set skill)</p>

<p>I seem not to be able to employ all the skills that i got somehow or other.</p>

<p>Status item, Self-evolution (rank 1 magic stone 5/100 memory 10) With what is said, memory 10 seems like the number of skills which can be equipped.</p>

<p>(/tn note ***Yay that means i got it wrong but then got it right. haha ***)</p>

<p>To be sure<br>
Digging : Lv1, Dismantling: Lv1, Warning: Lv1 Swordplay : Lv1 Club technique: Lv1 Leader: Lv1 Art of survival : Lv1 Climbing :Lv 1 Poison resistance : Lv1 Poison fang.</p>

<p>Are the 10 skills which are set.<br>
When i tried removing Club technique and set vibration sensing, i was able to do it.<br>
Well, i don’t really need 「club technique」, so let’s go as is until i get a new skill.</p>

<p>Leader, art of survival, poisonous resistance, and climbing obviously don’t to seem to be necessary for me.<br>
I want to get a transformation skill</p>

<p>With that said it is time to resume the search.</p>

<p>The next discovery was 2 shadows that were walking ahead.<br>
By the silhouette it seems like a bowlegged chimpanzee walking on two legs, Green Skin, it is those ugly fellows.</p>

<p>『A Goblin.<br>
Furthermore, it’s holding something in its hand』</p>

<p>Race: Goblin : Evil demon: Demon Beast: Lv2<br>

Warning: Lv1</p>

<p>Without status i would not be able to tell that the goblin on the right is slightly a higher level than the other, it’s a good skill.<br>
Well, they are weaker than the other 3 i killed earlier.<br>
It seems i’ll manage somehow.<br>
Moreover their prey the poison rat was being held up.<br>
That will be mine!</p>

<p>Using the shadow of a bush so as to not be noticed i approached.<br>
The distance is about 2 meters.</p>

<p>First, its the higher leveled one.</p>

<p>『HYUUHHHAA! Hand over the magic stone!』</p>

<p>Un, I’m not really that bloodthirsty, i just wanted to try saying that!</p>

<p>DOS</p>

<p>With a dull sound, i pierced the goblin from behind.<br>
There was no resistance at all.</p>

<p>I pull out of the goblin body immediately while noticing that the sword blade glitters.<br>
And attacked the other stunned goblin.</p>

<p>With this, 2.<br>
I was able to get throwing technique and hunting skills without a problem.</p>

<p>And the new demon.<br>
But i looked puzzled at a strange point.<br>
It doesn’t have a neck.<br>
No matter what i think it’s strange.</p>

<p>『Poison fang rat? Though, Is there only Warning for a skill?』</p>

<p>Even if i think how, its strange that it doesn’t have a poison fang in its skills.<br>
It doesn’t match the name.<br>
For now, i tried turning up the rats lips with telekinesis.<br>
Long Canine teeth.<br>
And yellow liquid comes out from the points of its teeth.<br>
is it venom?</p>

<p>Fumu.<br>
Why is it? There is a skill such as Poison fang in a centipede, and not the rat that has poison fangs.</p>

        </div>
        

<p>Even if i worry, there are to few hints.<br>
If i hunt more demon beasts i will slowly gather information.<br>
The skills seemed to have reacted immediately.</p>

<p>Thanks to vibration sensing and hunting that is.<br>
I could sense some existence while moving subtly across the grass.<br>
It does not seem to be so big.</p>

<p>I sneak around to the other side of a bush slowly.</p>

HP:13 MP:5 Strength : 9 Endurance :11 Agility :15 Int :6 Magic :3 Dexterity : 7<br>

Poison resistance : Lv1 , Digestion reinforcement.</p>

<p>A bird?<br>
The sensing ability seems wonderful!<br>
Here we’ll carefully.</p>

<p>I skimmed the ground while flying to not make any sounds, careful to avoid grass, and attacked.</p>

<p>I cut its neck and the scavenger is soon lying on the ground.</p>

<p>『Phew.. Because it would be troublesome if it flew away,<br>
I’m glad i was able to defeat it first.</p>

<p>』 I stab into the Scavenger and absorb its magic stone.</p>

<p>I learned digestion reinforcement.<br>
However, I don’t need digestion reinforcement.<br>
After all i have no digestive organs.<br>
In the first place this skill could be remembered.<br>
I admire the lack of constancy of self-evolution.</p>

<p>Well, is the next victim here?<br>
A guy possessing the skills that i don’t have is good if possible.</p>

<p>In that way i caught a strange shadow when looking for prey.</p>

<p>Something like a kite, floating at low altitude.<br>
The movement speed isn’t fast, but the movement is strange and irregular.<br>
It looks like a flying green jellyfish.</p>

HP: 14 MP:10 Strength : 6 Endurance : 11 Agility :4 Int :2 Magic :11 Dexterity : 5<br>

<p>I try getting closer, but it doesn’t react.<br>
Only, ten meters ahead of me, it still just floats.</p>

<p>Should i attack it? I decided to try to slash at it first!<br>
I target is its core and the location with a design that looks like eyes, on its mushroom/jellyfish like body.</p>

<p>Whatever there is, i seem able to react, so i approach slowly.<br>
And it was as soon as i approached about 2 meters away.<br>
The air floater showed a movement more alert and agile than i could imagine.</p>

<p>『Ueee, I’ve got a bad feeling!』</p>

<p>About 10 tentacles have stretched towards me.<br>
The red tentacles moves strangly reminding me of an angleworm or a snake.<br>
Very creepy.</p>

<p>But, because i stopped for an instant to take in that horrible site, the tentacles wrapped around me.</p>

<p>『Ugh, Is my MP being absorbed?』</p>

<p>Via the tentacle, I understood that my MP was being siphoned off.<br>
In addition to feeling terrible, it’s dangerous.</p>

<p>I feverishly attempted to escape.<br>
Fortunately, the strength of the tentacle was no bid deal, and it was possible to move just a little to cut myself out of its grasp.</p>

<p>『Hii〜<br>
That was close!』</p>

<p>When i checked my status, about 10 of my MP had been sucked away.<br>
If i would have stayed being held, i wonder how it would have turned out.</p>

<p>That guy is dangerous.<br>
I’m committed to kill it.</p>

<p>I decided to sneak over top of the air floater, when in place i charged with maximum velocity.<br>
After all, as for the power and strength of the tentacles, they aren’t that great.<br>
I cut the tentacles that have come after me once again, skip and pierce its body.</p>

<p>With the feeling of having penetrated some hard object comes a shining sword blade.<br>
The evidence that the magic stone which is a vital spot was destroyed.</p>

<p>With a “thud” the air floater deprived of the power fell to the ground.<br>
Because it was floating by the power of a skill, that body which died lost buoyancy.</p>

<p>And a skill of Flotation and magic absorption is added to me.<br>
They both seem like useful skills.<br>
In particular, i tried floating and it was very compatible with telekinesis.</p>

<p>At any rate, even if nothing is done, it’s a decent skill.<br>
Of course it takes MP to use , but it takes far less than to float using only a telekinetic force.<br>
When it’s combined with telekinesis, I can fly 5 times longer.<br>
If magic absorption is also combined, i could fly even longer.</p>

<p>In that way i noticed a certain thing when i inspected floating.</p>

<p>『Though an air floater had a skill like flotation if i remember right, there were no such skills of flight in the scavenger.<br>
Though it is a demon beast of the bird type.』</p>

<p>It’s the same as the poison fang rat.<br>
The skills that should be there are not.</p>

<p>Is there a common point?<br>
Poison fang and the flight skills to is there a reason?<br>
Well, as for flight i don’t know if i can obtain it since i don’t have any wings.</p>

<p>Un? Wait a moment, If it’s wingless, can’t a flight skill be used? After all is flight not a skill?</p>

<p>For example there are no skills such as walking or breathing in a goblin.<br>
And it’s the same as it’s natural for a bird to fly.<br>
That’s the proper function in which not magic, but a body has a skill.<br>
The magic and the skills aren’t related there.</p>

<p>So when i think so, as for the fang of the poison fang rat, couldn’t it have simply been a mechanism of the body using something like a poison gland that gives venom to the fangs?<br>
It’s the same as the poisonous snakes which were also on earth.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the Poison Fang the giant centipede used was poison which was created by magic, it’s probably a fantasy-like special ability.</p>

<p>『Because swordplay is an acquired one which was trained and obtained, can it also be absorbed as a skill? 』</p>

<p>There are still many things i do not understand about my body.<br>
More inspections seem to be necessary.</p>

<p>The hawk eye skill was also considerably good.<br>
It’s a skill which gives the ability to see things in a bird’s eye view. (T/N The author calls the skill Falcon/Hawk eye but it seems it is actually meant less literally such as being birds eye, so its really just a 3rd person POV skill.)<br>
Fortunately, the whole environment could be seen now.<br>
It’s the feeling as if the camera is now affixed to a fan that can finally move freely, instead of before where it was as if i was looking through a camera fixed to a handle.<br>
Well, it isn’t possible to separate very far from the body.</p>

<p>【Alright! Time to hunt even more various kinds!】</p>

<p>By the way, the status of the present sword is</p>

<p>Name: Unknown<br>
Race: Intelligence weapon<br>
Attack power : 132 Magic Power 200/200 Durability 100/100<br>
Skills<br>
Appraisal Lv6, Self- recovery, self- evolution, (Rank 1, Magic stone level 9/100, memory: 10) self modification, telekinesis, telepathy, small rise in owner status, small rise in owner recovery, skills sharing, magic<br>
Set skills<br>
Digging Lv1, Warning Lv1, Sword play Lv1, Hunting Lv1, Vibration sensing Lv1 , Throwing art Lv1, Magic absorption Lv1, Birds eye view, Poison fang, Floating.<br>
Memory skill<br>
Dismantling Lv1, Club Technique Lv1 , Leader lv1, art of Survival Lv1, poison resistance Lv1, Kobold Killer, Digestion reinforcement.</p>

<p>Modification point.<br>
(These are the changes the author made. ) I added “the eyes of the hawk” (Birds eye view as i called it) skill to the air floater and added the following parts to the sentence.</p>

<p>(T/N Copy paste cause its not important and im lazy ) It was the thing which the effect of the eyes skill of the hawk which stayed was considerably good for. It’s a skill that this skill be things to see in bird’s eye view. You can now see almost all around. Was a point of view like a camera fixed to the hilt up to now, but now fans sense 0 Le like camera move freely, like looking at things.<br>
END</p>

    < /br>

        <p>Chapter 5- Rank up!<br>
『OraOra! What color is your magic stone!』</p>

<p>It is now the 5th day since i have been reincarnated as a sword.<br>
It was just after i had slain the 12th demon beast since morning that this happened.</p>

<p>【Self-evolution has activated.<br>
Self-evolution points acquired : 10】</p>

<p>Immediately i check my status.</p>

<p>Self-evolution 【rank 2, Magic stone value 102/300, Memory 12 points 10】</p>

<p>The magic stone value has exceeded 100</p>

<p>「Oh, isn’t it early?」</p>

<p>When checking it this morning, the magic stone value should have only been at 80.</p>

<p>「Hmmm, The only difference since yesterday is that i moved to another hunting ground.」</p>

<p>Because i understood that i could fight without a problem, i moved my monster hunting grounds further from the ruins.</p>

<p>The enemies seem to become stronger as i leave the ruins, A 「Crash Boar」with a hammer like nose, An 「Iron Ant」which is a demon ant that can even crush rocks, Bigger and badder monsters appear frequently prowling the area.</p>

<p>They are also higher levels, possess more skills, and their magic stones are bigger.</p>

<p>『So, Size of the magic stone….. 』<br>
『Perhaps, the magic stone from strong demons, has a value that isn’t 1?』</p>

<p>Yeah maybe.<br>
In the first place, the magic stone of 「Crash Boar」of two meters, and the magic stone from the small fry goblin can’t be worth the same value.</p>

<p>『Will i confirm it a little in detail?』</p>

<p>My status has also improved.<br>
Moreover, it improved more than you can imagine.</p>

<p>Attack power : 162 Magic power : 300 Endurance: 200</p>

<p>『Oh! this fellow is happy, If i keep absorbing the magic stones, becoming the world’s strongest sword is not just a dream! I’m also increasing the number of memories quietly. 』</p>

<p>Ok, Lets aim for the counter stop! *( TN counter stop is the highest level a skill can reach)*</p>

<p>『And… What is point 10 of the self-evolution?』</p>

<p>When leveling up, i seemed to get it.<br>
I try to examine there in detail.</p>

<p>Oh? Some various items appeared.<br>
Is it a list of skills?</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>A list of possible skill acquisition.<br>
Attack power small rise, Durability value small rise, Telekinesis small rise, Sense talk small rise, Magic power small rise, Memory increase (small), skill level up, demon beast knowledge, plant knowledge, mineral knowledge.</p>

<p>Ooo? Though there are various kinds, is it that? Is it a bonus skill-like fellow?</p>

<p>I pick small increase in Magic Power, for the time being.</p>

<p>【Use 5 points, to acquire magic power small rise? Yes/No 】</p>

<p>Can i get it really? It’s YES of course!</p>

<p>【You have acquired Magic Power small rise】</p>

<p>Then the self-evolution points decreased to 5, and magic power small rise was added to the skill list.<br>
Furthermore, my MP went up by 100!<br>
Self-evolution sensei is great~! What next? I want everything, but i don’t have enough points.</p>

<p>This time, i try to choose the skill level up.<br>
As for this, surprisingly it seemed to be able to make a memory skill i possessed at present increase in level.<br>
But, i seem to have to choose a skill separately.</p>

<p>When i tried choosing fencing it required 2 points.<br>
Everything was tried but in the end everything was 2 points to level up.<br>
However, poison fang seemed to take 5 points.</p>

<p>Floating also required 5 points. What is the difference, i wonder if poison fang and floating are 5 points because they do not have a level.</p>

<p>Umu. i am at a loss in various ways, but I’ll choose Attack power small rise here.<br>
It would be the most effective against the demon animals.</p>

<p>And, after attack power small rise was added my Attack Power rose by 50.<br>
Good.<br>
With this, I came to look forward to increasing the magic stones value.</p>

<p>『”Yoshi!”, A motivation came! I’ll hunt demons around here, hunt and hunt exhaustively! 』</p>

<p>So I’ve decided, let’s take action at once!<br>
I glide triumphantly, through the plains.<br>
Looking for monsters from the sky and striking them down on discovery.</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Goblin ・Immediately ・Decapitated!</h1>

<p>This is my first Translation of any kind. Please treat it well, and point out any mistakes I’ve made! I didn’t write this, once again, I just translated it! Enjoy!</p>

<p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p>『Magic Stone getー!』</p>

<p>「shiyugiyagiyaー!」</p>

<p>『As expected, dens are delicious!』</p>

<p>Currently, I’m in a Goblin den.</p>

<p>But I wasn’t able to find it on my own; I followed an underling Goblin and found it.</p>

<p>I just let it swim for a bit, and it led me to its den all on its own. With that, I got them all at once. What a great strategy.</p>

<p>I had followed the Goblin by flying at low altitude. My footwork was completely silent. Well, I don’t have any feet, but that’s how it was.</p>

<p>I must have been stalking him for… About an hour? The Goblin had started dancing abruptly at points, and became engrossed with the sight of ants walking in procession, so most of my time was completely wasted.</p>

<p>I didn’t even observe the Goblin for a long time, but its actions were quite irritating. Because it advanced so slowly, I had contemplated killing it many times.</p>

<p>『Beheading that Gob left a deep impression on me.』</p>

<p>I’d like to praise myself for enduring for as long as I did.</p>

<p>And so, I’ve continued to assassinate Goblins since then.</p>

<p>I should have gotten rid of more than 30 already, but an uproar has yet to occur. Have they really not noticed me yet?</p>

<p>『Oh, I arrived at quite the wide passage.』</p>

<p>I just continue advancing. Around the corner’s a large room; it’s about 20 meters in length, but the height is a little less than 10 meters.</p>

<p>Inside, crowded together, there’re Goblins, Goblins, and more Goblins. There’s gotta be more than 50 of them.</p>

<p>1 on 1, they’re nothing but small fry, but in these numbers, they’re a considerable threat. I can easily defeat even medium-sized monsters, but… That’s the power of a group for you.</p>

<p>Later I learned that the Threat Level spikes when Monsters that can use group tactics make a horde.</p>

<p>The Threat Level that a single Goblin possesses is “G”. However, it becomes “F” when there are 10, and it becomes “E” when there’re more than 100.</p>

<p>By the way, Threat Level “E” is the equivalent of a Lesser Basilisk or an Ogre. It’s at the level that entire villages are essentially doomed.</p>

<p>And, at the back of the room sat an eye-catching existence. Many wounds are engraved onto its face, and its build is close to twice that of the other Goblins. Its appearance fits the word “Veteran” to a tee. It’s dressed in Iron Armor, with a huge Sword propped up to the side; both were likely taken from Adventurers.</p>

<p>『<strong>Ohh!</strong> Bingo!』</p>

<p>Race : Goblin King : Evil : Demonic Beast Lv.21</p>

<p>HP：87　MP：26　STR : 47　END：39　AGI：26　INT：17　MGC：16　DEX：29 (¹)</p>

<p>Skills:<br>
Intimidation：Lv1, Sword Arts：Lv2, Swordplay：Lv4, Leadership：Lv4、Raise Morale：Lv3, Shield Arts：Lv2, Provocation：Lv1, Throwing Technique：Lv1, Ambition：Lv1, Controlled Willpower</p>

<p>Equipment:<br>
Broken Crude-Iron Long Sword, Cracked Crude-Iron Armor, Leather Shield, Leather Loincloth (²)</p>

<p>Its Status is incomparable with the other Goblins. It truly is the Goblin King.</p>

<p>『Perhaps they’re aware of an intruder, but chose to defend the King?』</p>

<p>While looking at its Status, I trembled in delight. Excitement, like one you would get standing before an all-you-can-eat buffet, is welling up.</p>

<p>Moreover, I’ve confirmed that the other guys are the best of their kind. There’s a Soldier, Archer, and a Knight as well as a Mage, Thief, Warrior, Monk, Healer, and Shaman, whose existances were unconfirmed until now.</p>

<p>『I’ll do it!』</p>

<p>I thoroughly enhance my power. Telekinesis’ strength is capable of being changed depending on the mental image, and it’s possible to generate tremendous acceleration with Telekinesis via Magic.</p>

<p>Making use of these facts, I name it: <strong>The Telekenesis Catapult Attack</strong>! Kukuku, the first to taste it is you, Goblin King!</p>

<p>Jumping around the corner, I aim at the Goblin King and release my power. I went from 0 to max speed near instantly. In no time, I arrived at the King.</p>

<p>Telekinesis is completely silent. And so, the Goblin King wasn’t able to react at all.</p>

<p>And so, I pierce right into the face of the Goblin King.</p>

<p><strong><em>*DOBON!*</em></strong> (³)</p>

<p>I, who flew at the head of the Goblin King, became stuck in the wall.</p>

<p>My power is frightening even to myself. It’s surpassed the level of a Catapult; it’s already at the level of a cannon.</p>

<p>With a slight delay, the Goblin King’s body slowly fell, and for an instant, silence dominates the room.</p>

<p>After that instant, shrieks and angry shouts resonate within the small space from the Goblins.</p>

<p>『GiyaoOOOoo!』<br>
『GuRuuuAAAa!』<br>
『GoRURUUuaaa!』</p>

<p>One guy panics and, flustered, runs up to the body of the King and roars. There certainly are many reactions.</p>

<p>Then, besides the King, the guy who must be something like the King’s Adjutant shouts out something amidst the chaos. After that, 5 Goblins turn towards the passage and start running.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>The Goblins, which don’t think that a sword moved of its own fruition, seem to think that somebody threw a sword from the depths of the passage.</p>

<p>All of the Goblins, together, turn their eyes to the passage.</p>

<p>Idiots! There’ll be no one there even if you all look that way!</p>

<p>Smoothly, I slide out of the wall. With that momentum, I collided with the Adjutant. (⁴)</p>

<p>Or rather, it’s no exaggeration to say I specifically targeted this guy.</p>

<p>『Give me your Magic Skills!』</p>

<p>As a tactical goal, I aimed at the King. But as far as Goblins are concerned, the Goblin I wanted to defeat the most would be this Goblin Mage. I was dying for this guy’s Skills ever since I saw them.</p>

<p>Race : Goblin Mage : Evil : Demonic Beast Lv.9</p>

<p>HP：27　MP：36　STR : 14　END：15　AGI：20　INT：16　MGC：19　DEX：12</p>

<p>Skills:<br>

<p>Equipment:<br>
Broken Oak Staff, Fur Robe</p>

<p>『<em>Fuhahahahahaha!</em> With this, I can use magic!』</p>

<p>It’s magic in a different world! One of the yearnings of the otakus! By all means I wanted to use it!</p>

<p>And that very same magic has just fallen into my hands! There’s no helping it if I’m a little excited!</p>

<p>『But before trying Magic, I’ll finish up with guys!』</p>

<p>From there, it was a one sided slaughter.</p>

<p>The increased Morale brought about by the King disappeared alongside him, so the Goblins quickly started panicking and fell into disorder. The Mage, which had the ability to quell the confusion, had disappeared as well.</p>

<p>Top of their species or not, they’re no match when they’re no longer acting as a group. Normal Goblins can’t even deal damage to me, so long as it isn’t a critical.</p>

<p>And so, the Goblins lost the power of the group and became nothing but a disorderly crowd. Or rather, due to their close proximity, they’re just obstructing each other’s movement, so they might be even less of a threat than regular.</p>

<p>『Alright, this guy’s the last Archer!』</p>

<p>As for the other guys who could attack over long distances, I cleared them all up moments earlier. Afterwards, to me who couldn’t be attacked by staying close to the ceiling, the crowd of EXP Values could only look up.</p>

<p>I simply defeated Goblins while flying around the outskirts of the herd, taking precedence to the ones who try to run away, as keep them from escaping. A considerable amount of Goblins still escaped, but 30 of them were still hunted down in the end.</p>

<p>The improvement of my Skill Levels surprised me. When I absorbed the power of the Goblins’ Magic Stones, Swordplay and Club Arts improved in succession.</p>

<p>It seems that when I have the same Skill as my enemy, absorbing their Magic Stone increases Skill Proficiency. Or perhaps I simply absorb the accumulated Level of the enemy’s Skills? Well, either way, the fact that Skills can be improved is some pleasant information.</p>

<p>『<em>Fuhahahahaha!</em> Give me the experience!』</p>

    < /br>

        <h1>Night Flight</h1>

<p>I think I’ve gotten better at TL’ing, even though this is only my second time doing it now.</p>

<p>I take creative privileges during/after TL’ing (mainly grammatical stuff and making sentences flow better — no adding in random stuff, of course), but there are still some lines I’m not 100% sure on. I’d be thankful if anyone would add any suggestions to the areas I’ve footnoted.</p>

<p>Also, in regards to the previous chapter, I’ve changed “Intimidation” from the King’s Skills to “Coercion”, as I had thought it might be. <strong>*Next Line is a Spoiler!*</strong> This is because the <em>real</em> Intimidation Skill shows up in this chapter. <strong>*End of Spoiler!*</strong>. I also changed Narcotic Fang to Anesthetic Fang, as per the suggestion by Greed ⅩⅧ.</p>

<p>Ah, one last thing… The MC uses some pretty strong language, I’ve found. So if you don’t like swears… Ⱥṿɇɍŧ ŧħɨᵰɇ ɇɏɇṩ.</p>

<p>Now then, onto the Chapter!</p>

<p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p>Um… Which way is the Pedestal?</p>

<p>I eliminated the entire nest of Goblins and emerged triumphantly, but…</p>

<p>The darkness of night has already wrapped around the surrounding area, so I’ve lost my sense of direction.</p>

<p>『Well, there’s the silver Moon over there, so…?』</p>

<p>I have no idea. I don’t know what direction the Moon rises and, of course, I don’t know I don’t know which direction the Sun rises either. I’m already a completely lost child.</p>

<p>『Should I give up going home today…?』</p>

<p>To me, the Pedestal has been certified as my home, more or less. I’d like to return there every day, if possible. In addition, sitting inside of the Pedestal somehow gives me peace of mind.</p>

<p>However, it seems that it’s impossible to return.</p>

<p>Well, it can’t be helped, so let’s treat ourselves to some late-night hunting. Until now, I had been hesitant to go out at night in the Plains, but I don’t have a choice.</p>

<p>With that, I took to the air and searched for Demonic Beasts while maintaining a height where the ground is just barely in view. I’m not only at this height to search for Demonic Beasts, but also to easily reach the ground in case of a surprise attack from above.</p>

<p>『Flying high in the sky, I can see quite far into the distance; it’s quite nice.』</p>

<p>I haven’t seen one yet, but being attacked by some sort of transcendent Dragon would be the worst. So, not with just my eyes, I’m remaining vigilant with all five senses. Well, it’s five sense-like things, because I don’t have a body.</p>

<p>Anyways, it seems that the strength of Demonic Beasts doesn’t spike up just because of the night. Rather, it seems that they’ve grown weaker under the cover of darkness.</p>

<p>Even if it takes time to find them, combat’s settled in an instant.</p>

<p>『It’s good, it’s good! Using Echolocation to detect them! Convenient Skills are great!』 (¹)</p>

<p>For Monsters of the night, exploration Skills are quite substantial.</p>

<p>Especially Echolocation. With this Skill, I can grasp the topography of the area as well as Demonic Beasts, so I’m able to search the surroundings with considerable detail.</p>

<p>『Amassing Demon Stones like this, I wonder if I’ll be able to Rank up?』</p>

<p>Yeah, I was getting caught up in the moment. I was so successful in killing the nocturnal Demonic Beasts that, in my excitement, I didn’t pay attention to my surroundings. I had single-mindedly focused only on chasing prey.</p>

<p>「GYarURUroOOOo!」</p>

<p>Suddenly, such a roar resounded within my ears. I look up to find the source, and find a Demonic Beast whose size far surpasses that of a Giant Bat approaching from above.</p>

<p>『Impossible! There was no reaction from Echolocation!』</p>

<p>Shortly before, I had used Echolocation, but there was absolutely no response.</p>

<p>「Gyagyaoo!」</p>

<p>『Ohtto!』 (²)</p>

<p>At extremely-high speed, the huge shadow passes by right beside me.</p>

<p>It’s like a plane! (³)</p>

<p>『Nuah!』</p>

<p>A sound similar to a high-pitched metallic shriek comes from my blade with just a grazing touch. The impact is terrific, with all trees within about 10 meters being blown away. But that’s not all. With just that slight contact, checking my Status, my Durability was shaved off by 30.</p>

<p>『Shit! What an unpleasant surprise!』 (⁴)</p>

<p>Are surprise attacks your main strategy? No thanks. (⁵) I’m just a sword. Aren’t I a good sword? Even if I am, I’m just a sword! A sword! (⁶)</p>

<p>But I’ll still feel offended when I’m struck! (⁷)</p>

<p>I was sent flying in surprise, but I managed to stabilize my posture in the air. I wasn’t able to get a good look at my assailant, however.</p>

<p>Fast! That’s all I can say.</p>

<p>And, I figured out why it wasn’t caught with Echolocation.</p>

<p>Although it hasn’t even been five seconds since it collided with this master of the shadows, it’s already far off into the distance. He’s way too fast.</p>

<p>I don’t always use Echolocation, but when I do, it usually takes about a minute to examine the area. (⁸) If something has that much speed approaches from more than 30 meters away, then it takes about 5 seconds for the signal to reach me.</p>

<p>「Gyoooo!」</p>

<p>『Damn, here it comes again!』</p>

<p>I try using Appraisal at the last second while barely dodging him.</p>

<p>Strong! It’s a Wyvern: a degradation of the dragon species — it’s just a degradation, but it’s still the strongest Demonic Beast I’ve seen se far! It’s got a lot of Skills, too!</p>

<p>I avoided a direct hit because I devoted myself to evasion, but with wind pressure alone my whole body was shaken as a fierce gust of wind assaults me.</p>

<p>I’ve made light of this world. I’ve never had a hard fight, and as for Dragons, isn’t there no room for fighting half-heartedly? I think so.</p>

<p>『Damn it!』</p>

<p>My opponent might be able to move even faster than this.</p>

<p>Isn’t this an impossible game? No, wait. If I give up, then it really will be the end. It’s still too early to give up. When the time comes, I’ll be able to escape to the ground somehow. Maybe. But before that, let’s take on this challenge. Or rather, it’s unlikely that I’ll be able to get away if I don’t do anything to it. I’ll have to depend on counterattacks, even if all I can do is damage him a little.</p>

<p>So, let’s try to counter his charge. I speed up a bit in reverse, as to make an attempt to run at the same time. Survival is my priority.</p>

<p>Like that, I wait for the rush of the Wyvern. It seems that because it’s so fast, turning to charge once again takes a bit of time. While circling widely, it turns this way. The fact that I don’t have to worry about being rushed consecutively is my only saving grace in this situation.</p>

        </div>
        

<p>『It’s coming!』</p>

<p>「Gurugyaooo!」</p>

<p>My aim is its Abdomen, which appears to be softer than the rest of its body. I’ll barely dodge the dash by escaping below, and then raise my edge skywards to cut its stomach. I’m unsure whether it’ll go well, but I’ll try it anyways. If it’s wounded, then I’ll take that opportunity to escape.</p>

<p>Rapidly, its huge body approaches, but I was unexpectedly calm. Certainly, it’s faster than things like Cars and Motorcycles, but there’s no need to be overwhelmed because it’s simply coming at me in a straight line. My plan… Will it work?</p>

<p>『Sooi!』</p>

<p>「Guraa!」</p>

<p>Yeah. I failed. In the middle of a rush, this guy dodged the full brunt of my swing. But it left a deeper impression than I thought it would. Even though I intended to calm myself down, my subconscious seemed to find fear regardless. The edge that I raised only cut the Wyvern’s stomach a little. To its huge body, I made a scratch. When I found that I had given it a wound, I was genuinely happy.</p>

<p>「GURUruRUwu!」</p>

<p>『Wait, didn’t that make it super mad?!』</p>

<p>Even though I dealt so little damage, it seems that its anger is at its MAX! Didn’t this tactic have a boomerang effect?! While making its turn, its vicious eyes were glaring, completely fixed on me.</p>

<p>『Isn’t this slightly bad?』</p>

<p>And, it rushes once again. I had resolved myself ー to dodge this guy.</p>

<p>『Guaa!』</p>

<p>「GYAGYAUUUOOOO!」</p>

<p>『Damn it! This damn lizard! ー Even though it was only struck once!』</p>

<p>Because I understood the balance of defense and offense, I aimed to counter, but the Wyvern immediately performed a feat of acrobatics using its tail, manipulating its centrifugal force. With that, I received a direct hit from the talons on its hind leg.</p>

<p>But I didn’t simply take the attack. When I was hit by its claw, I was bounced directly in front of the fellow’s eye, so I made the split-second decision to jab myself into it. Well, as a result, the tip of my blade has been broken. The fragments should still be within the Wyvern’s right eye. Serves you right!</p>

<p>「GIIGIIIAAAAAAAA!」</p>

<p>It twists and writhes in agony while flying (although its flights seems quite disturbed).</p>

<p>『Apart from that, am I alright?』</p>

<p>Only about ⅔ of my blade is left. The rest splendidly snapped off. Naturally, there’s no pain, but am I really alright?</p>

<p>There doesn’t seem to be any problem flying. To begin with, I fly using Telekinesis and Floating, so my flight has nothing to do with air resistance. And so, even with a change in shape, there’s absolutely no change whatsoever.</p>

<p>Magical Power doesn’t seem to be leaking out from the damage, either.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, I’m alright. How much will Self-Repair be able to regenerate, I wonder. It’d be unpleasant to remain in this state.</p>

<p>When I thought such, the broken part of my blade began to glow slightly. Then, although it’s only a couple of millimeters, it starts to bulge. This is probably the start of restoration.</p>

<p>Phew. Self-Repair seems to be working properly.</p>

<p>『Shit, that damn Lizard! How dare it do this to me!』</p>

<p>Anger immediately boiled up after I confirmed my own safety. To put my beautiful white blade into this tragic state… Inexcusable.</p>

<p>It seems that the Wyvern doesn’t plan on letting this slide either. With my mind distorted by hatred, I recklessly throw myself up at the Wyvern. My reason vanished completely , but I can only chase it endlessly. (⁹)</p>

<p>Its movements have become poor with its injury, but it’s still faster than me.</p>

<p>『Even so, I’ll do it!』</p>

<p>I’ll cut him up until he’s nothing but a pile of severed bones! If my body’s a sword, then it’s no longer restricted with the same limits that I’m used to! And, if so, then I must be able to do more! (¹⁰)</p>

<p>First, I slow down a little to change the course of the Wyvern. That way, it would be mislead into thinking that I was going to escape. With that, the Lizard-bastard threw itself in a straight line.</p>

<p>What an idiot! It took the bait!</p>

<p>I change my route at once, accelerating towards the wing of the Wyvern. The Lizard-bastard was headed completely straight, so it can’t dodge.</p>

<p>Then, with both of us accelerating with tremendous momentum, we collide. As a result, my blade almost completely disappears. The remaining amount would be about ⅒. But it was worth it, as the Lesser Wyvern’s left wing was cut at the base, causing it to fall to the ground.</p>

<p>Through my baiting, the altitude exceeds 30 meters. As one would expect, not even a Sub-Dragon could fall from this height without a scratch.</p>

<p>Upon approaching the Lesser Wyvern that fell to the ground, its neck is bent in a strange direction with a large quantity of blood, vomit, and excreta pouring from its mouth. (¹¹) The body’s still convulsing, but it’s only a matter of time before it meets its end.</p>

<p>『Fuー Looks like I somehow won.』</p>

<p>That was dangerous. If I received just a little more damage, I would have been done for. My remaining Durability is 23. I really did just barely survive.</p>

<p>『Well, it’s good that I defeated it…… But what should be done about the Magic Stone?』</p>

<p>The Magic Stone needs to be recovered, but retrieving it from the Lizard-bastard will be difficult for me who’s lost most of my blade. There must be a way, right?</p>

<p>Watching the recovery of Self-Repair, it seems like it’ll take quite some time to make a full recovery. It’s possible that it won’t be repaired overnight either.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on this plain crawling with starved Demonic Beasts, I can’t help but think that the Lesser Wyvern’s corpse isn’t exactly “safe”.</p>

<p>『Well, I’ll manage somehow……』</p>

<p>As for recovery via Self-Repair, it seems that the ooze coming out is bound to the broken section.</p>

<p>『Nunununu…!』</p>

<p>I’ve got to put some fighting spirit into it! While doing so, didn’t the speed of the ooze squeezing out increase!? ー Yeah, what stupid things are you doing, me.</p>

<p>『Oh?』</p>

<p>I have the feeling that the brightness of my blade increased, somehow. Is this, by any chance…… Ohh. The restoration speed of the blade rose remarkably. Seriously?</p>

<p>Is it possible that the even the effects of auto-recovery Skills increase when it coincides with the user’s intentions? Alongside that increase, my MP is decreasing at an amazing speed; 1 MP/sec. But it’s worth it at this point, as my blade will be completely repaired at the expense of only ~200 MP.</p>

<p>『It was a struggle, but I gained some useful knowledge.』</p>

<p>Along with the Magic Stone. These are the fruits of struggling with all my strength. Its Magic Stone is comparable to being 20 combined into 1.</p>

<p>The Lesser Wyvern’s Magic Stone was located at the base of its neck. I had attempted to aim at it in the middle of combat, too.</p>

<p>『Well, let’s take a rest for today in the bushes.』</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>My first time using Magic</h1>

<p>Or, rather than “considering” I should say “I’ve already started”. Because the chapters are a bit longer than Sword-bro chapters, I’m working on them bit by bit — but Sword-bro is honestly much easier to translate in my opinion.</p>

<p>It must have something to do with the fact that this writing style doesn’t have a lot of long sentences, so it’s easier on the machines… Well, anyways.</p>

<p>As you might have noticed, the shading on the sight was brightened up a bit, as to make the works easier to read on Mobile devices. If possible, I’d like people who use said devices to take a look at  and tell me whether there’s a good enough difference. My eyes aren’t bleeding with the current Shade, so it’s fine… But making it any lighter’ll be painful, I think.</p>

<p>Moving on from that, here’s another chapter!</p>

<p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p>It’s the day after I killed the Lesser Wyvern.</p>

<p>I rose to the sky and looked for the Pedestal; because it’s daytime, I could see farther, so I thought I’d have better luck finding it.</p>

<p>My suspicion turns out true, and I discover the pedestal a considerable distance away. It was terrible of me to leave it so far behind, so I planned to return to the pedestal immediately.</p>

<p>『<em>Uryaaー!</em>』</p>

<p>With that, I flew to the pedestal in great haste. I encountered Demonic Beasts along the way, but I pierced through all of their Magic Stones immediately; they were delicious. For me, who experienced heated combat with the Wyvern last night, lower leveled Demonic Beasts have stopped trying to confront me.</p>

<p>The farther away from the Pedestal, the stronger the Demonic Beasts seem to become. Conversely, the Demonic Beasts are weaker the more one approaches the Pedestal.</p>

<p>Surely, this is caused by the strange Magic which spreads out of the Pedestal. Perhaps it was set that way as a sort of Barrier. Because I had been using MP a lot recently, I was able to get that sort of feeling from the area. I don’t know who made such a thing, though. I wonder if it was my creator?</p>

<p>I arrived before even 1 hour passed, thanks to charging straight with all my power. In the end, moving during the day is the most efficient.</p>

<p>Although I was only gone for one night, I missed this place. It feels comfortable to be in the presence of the Barrier.</p>

<p>『Uooー! Pedestal! I’ve returned!』</p>

<p>With that, I dive into the pedestal.</p>

<p><em>*Supo*</em> (¹)</p>

<p>Mm, with this I can relax. It’s very calming inside of the Pedestal. After all, this place is my home. This Pedestal is a space of healing.</p>

<p>『Fuu. At last I can take a breath〜』</p>

<p>For a while, I spend time simply looking up at the clouds. Ahh, I feel at ease.</p>

<p>Taking breaks is quite enjoyable.</p>

<p>『Fufufufu…… <em>Aーhahahaha!</em> At last! I’m no longer just a simple sword!』(²)</p>

<p>Yes, because I have Magic.</p>

<p>During yesterday’s Goblin extermination, I obtained the Fire Magic Skill from a Goblin Mage. <strong><em>THE</em></strong> long-awaited Magic.</p>

<p>『Set Fire Magic.』 (³)</p>

<p>Preparations complete.</p>

<p>I focus my consciousness. I’ve used Skills many times, so I should be able to use Magic one way or another. That’s what I thought, but —</p>

<p>『Nothing’s happening.』</p>

<p>I can’t get the feeling of how to use Magic. I groaned and finished. That’s all.</p>

<p>『Why? Is it a lack of Magic Power? No, that Goblin Mage didn’t <em>seem</em> to have more than me…… For the time being, I’ll try setting all the Mage’s Skills.』</p>

<p>I set Minerology, Leadership, Staff Arts, War Staff Arts, Fire Magic, MGC ↑ Low, and Magic Manipulation, and then prayed for success. With that, a number of images appeared.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>Fire ・Arrow and Fire ・Shield? Then, I’ll choose Fire・Arrow.</p>

<p>If it’s going to be my first spell, it has to be Attack Magic!</p>

<p>『Ohh, the image of the incantation appeared.』</p>

<p>I try reading the incantation, which floated into my mind, out loud. As I did so, I could feel Magic Power flow from my blade.</p>

<p>『Fire ・Arrowー!』</p>

<p><em>*Shuon*</em> (⁴)</p>

<p>An arrow made out of flame is produced in the air in response to my shout.</p>

<p>『Oh, Ohhh?』</p>

<p>The finished flame arrow then flies like a genuine arrow into the distance. The Magic was a success.</p>

<p>『<em>Aーhahaha!</em> Success!』</p>

<p>The Fire Arrow’s power was only to the degree that it burnt some ground. It it’s like that, then it would be 100 times better to just rush in myself — <em>but it’s different</em>. The important thing is that I was able to use Magic all on my own.</p>

<p>『Then, onto the next! Fire ・Shield!』</p>

<p>A small buckler of flame is produced.</p>

<p>『Hmm. But how strong is it?』</p>

<p>I use Telekinesis to throw a stone. I’ll test it using power only to that degree. It’s thrown at about 130㎞/hour? The Shield seems to prevent it. Then I throw the 2nd, and then the 3rd.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that it can only be used to that degree.</p>

<p>The Shield managed to prevent the third shot, then disappeared. It might be able to prevent arrows, but it’s doubtful it would be effective against swords and axes.</p>

<p>After that, I played with magic for a short while. The MP consumption seems to be ~5 for both spells, so if I were to improve them, continuous use should be possible.</p>

<p>『Fire・Arrow! Fire・Arrow! Hyahhoー!』</p>

<p>I calmed down after ~30 minutes passed. A couple of shrubs may have caught on fire, but that might just be my imagination.</p>

<p>『Fuu. That reminds me, I still have to properly inspect these Skills.』</p>

<p>I’ll be setting the Skills needed to use Magic, so first I remove any Skills that seem unrelated.</p>

<p>The ones remaining were: Staff Arts, War Staff Arts, Fire Magic, MGC ↑ Low, and Magic Manipulation.</p>

<p>『These two don’t seem that related.』</p>

<p>I removed Staff Arts and War Staff Arts.</p>

<p>『Fire ・Arrow!』</p>

<p>It seemed to activate without a problem. Next, I should exclude MGC ↑ Low.</p>

<p>Again, I could still use Magic. Next, Magic Manipulation. At that point, I only had it and Fire Magic set.</p>

<p>『It can’t be used.』</p>

<p>I set Magic Manipulation once again.</p>

<p>『Fire ・Arrow.』</p>

<p><em>*Shuon*</em></p>

<p>It seems that Magic Manipulation is required to use Magic. I’ll have to leave it on from now on; that way, I won’t have to be worried if I get another skill with a similar name to Fire Magic.</p>

<p>『Maybe I should also set Willpower Manipulation? Magic Manipulation is needed for Magic, so I wonder what Willpower Manipulation is used for?』</p>

<p>The Skills that I received from the previous owner of Willpower Manipulation — the Goblin King — are: Coercion, Sword Arts, Swordplay, Leadership, Raise Morale, Shield Arts, Provocation, Throwing Techniques, Ambition, and Willpower Manipulation.</p>

<p>It it Swordplay? No, there’s no new techniques related to the Sword. — What’s this?</p>

<p>After inspecting Sword Arts, I found that it allowed usage of techniques with Willpower Manipulation. Sword techniques seem to consume MP for Warriors to use.</p>

<p>There’s Double ・Slash, which creates a twin attack, and Heavy ・Slash, which is something like a certain-kill technique. These are also quite interesting.</p>

<p>『Shall I try them immediately?』</p>

<p>If I have stronger techniques, then I can fight against stronger Demonic Beasts. The benefits will also apply to regular hunting.</p>

<p>『Goblin hunting has already been completed, so perhaps I should try going on a little excursion?』</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 9: Fierce Battle! The menace of Area 5</h1>

<p>A couple of notes:</p>

<p>First, this chapter is <em>huuuuuge</em> compared to the other ones, with over 3,000 words, as compared to the previous chapters’ less-than-2,000.</p>

<p>Second, I’ve changed “Skill Points” within Self-Evolution to plain old “Points” in this chapter and all previous ones. That’s because the points only apply to Self-Evolution.</p>

<p>Third, I changed the classification of Goblins and their ilk from “Evil” to “Evil Beasts”, because of a certain description in this chapter.</p>

<p>Fourth, the Author seems have gotten lazy in writing the Set/Memory Skills of Sword-bro, so I’m not sure if we’ll ever see those again. I haven’t read ahead (because I need to translate this stuff to read it in the first place), so I’m not sure if they’ll do it <em>eventually</em> but… Just a heads up.</p>

<p>Fifth, I’m moving tomorrow. So… Yeah. Don’t expect a chapter for the next day or so.</p>

<p>That’s all, read on!</p>

<p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p>It’s the been 10 days since I started wielding Magic.</p>

<p>My day-to-day life hasn’t changed; I spent my time striking fear into the hearts of Demonic Beasts by slaughtering them. Alongside that, I absorbed enough Magic Stones for Self-Evolution’s rank to reach 5.</p>

<p>I’ve also gained a large number of Skills, as well as Skill Proficiency. The hideout of Gourmet Orcs, which is a subspecies of Orc, was especially delicious as they had a great number of Techniques and Magic Skills.</p>

<p>As for their racial characteristics, most of them had a high level of Cooking and Dismantling, both going up to about Lv5. It’s laughable, but despite being a Skill that I’ve had no opportunity to use, now the only Skill with a level higher than those is Swordplay.</p>

<p>80% of the Plains have been dominated, so now it’s something akin to my personal garden.</p>

<p>『Alright, shall I go?』</p>

<p>The next thing to do would be to explore outside of the Plains. It’s a place that I named “Area 5” without permission.</p>

<p>Somehow or another, the strength of the Demonic Beasts isn’t distributed evenly around here. The farther away from the Pedestal’s Barrier in the Plains, the stronger the Demonic Beasts. It seems that around the Pedestal, only small fish like Goblins appear — I’ve designated that area as Area 1. As the number increases, so too does the strength of the surrounding Demonic Beasts.</p>

<p>And for now, Area 5 is set as the maximum difficulty.</p>

<p>Outside of Area 5 is completely uncharted territory. But from what I can see, the Plain suddenly becomes a Forest. Occasionally, I can catch a glimpse of Demonic Beasts that move between the trees, but they don’t seem much different from the small fries from Areas 1 and 2. There certainly don’t seem to be any that’re stronger than the Demonic Beasts of Area 5.</p>

<p>Well, as for the question of why Demonic Beasts of Area 5 don’t just go there, I might be able to understand once I’ve reached there.</p>

<p>『There’re no small fries.』</p>

<p>As the Area increases on the Plains, the number of Demonic Beasts tend to decrease. Instead, the Area widens, and the number of large Demonic Beasts increases. In Area 4, which was my main battlefield until yesterday, I was only able to hunt about 20 of them per day. But, because the Magic Stones’ values exceed 15 each, the gain is overwhelmingly more than simply hunting 100 Goblins.</p>

<p>Ah, by the way, this is my current Status:</p>

<p>Name：Unknown<br>
Race：Intelligent Weapon<br>
ATK：314　MP：1000/1000　Durability：800/800<br>
Skills:<br>
Appraisal：Lv6, High-Speed Self-Repair, Self-Evolution〈Rank 5・Magic Stone Status: 1366/1500・Memory: 34・Points: 23〉, Self-Modification, Telekinesis, Telekinesis ↑ Low, Telepathy, ATK ↑ Low, Owner ALL Stats ↑ Low, Owner HP Recovery ↑ Low, MP ↑ Low, Memory ↑ Low, Demonic Beast Knowledge, Skill Sharing, Magic</p>

<p>With regards to Skills, I changed them a lot, so I honestly can’t grasp all of them. Among them, there’re a lot of Skills that can’t even be used, too.</p>

<p>As for ones that I use all the time, Swordplay has a Skill Lv. Up bonus, so its level is particularly high.</p>

<p>Initially, it didn’t do much, but once its Level exceeded 3, it started showing overwhelming effects. As it increases one’s ability to manipulate a sword, what do you think happens if you <em>are</em> a sword? I became able to attack my opponent’s weak points with deadly accuracy.</p>

<p>In addition, my ability to elude the attacks of giant Demonic Beasts also increased. Because I have the body of a sword, it’s no exaggeration to say that this Skill rose both my Offense and Defense.</p>

<p>『Oh, a Demonic Beast!』</p>

<p>Race：Goblin：Evil Beast：Demonic Beast Lv3</p>

<p>HP：10　MP：2　STR：7　END：9　AGI：8　INT：4　MGC：2　DEX：7</p>

<p>Skills:<br>
Cooking：Lv1, Vigilance：Lv1, Poison Resistance：Lv1</p>

<p>Description: An evil being born of a fragment of the Evil God, which was destroyed 100,000 years ago. These beings are born with strong malice and hatred towards those not of their own Race, so it’s impossible for it to them to live in harmony with others. They excel in Agility and Dexterity, and they’re violent and cruel by nature. Upon discovery, it is recommended to exterminate these beings immediately. Threat Level: G</p>

<p>Magic Stone Position：Center of the body; the Solar Plexus.</p>

<p>I discover a Goblin walking near the end of Area 2. The Goblins’ nest was annihilated, but you can still see them occasionally.</p>

<p>As for the explanation provided under the rest of its Status, it’s the effect of Demonic Beast Knowledge, which I gained using Self-Evolution Points. It’s capable of being used in tandem with Appraisal.</p>

<p>Thanks to that, battles have become much easier, as the weak point of Demonic Beasts, the Magic Stone, has becomes clear. With that, I’m able to turn my initial attack into a certain-kill.</p>

<p>『But seriously, remove on sight…? They’re treated just like cockroaches.』</p>

<p>This is the first time I’ve met a Goblin after gaining Demonic Beast Knowledge, but I’m getting the feeling that they’re more evil than I initially thought. Well, that could simply be because I’m human-like. I was originally a human, and so I’ve decided to side with the humans at least. I’ll just turn these guys into EXP from now on.</p>

<p>In that way, I move while hunting Demonic Beasts and viewing their descriptions.</p>

<p>『Hyahoー!』</p>

<p>I had come up with a great movement method the other day.</p>

<p>1： Use Telekinesis at maximum firepower, and blast off.<br>
2：Entrust my descent to free-falling.<br>
3：Repeat.</p>

<p>I had thought of it while using the Telekinesis Catapult Attack. I name it: The Telekinesis Catapult Movement Method. (¹) Because the only expenditure occurs at the start, I can save MP.</p>

<p>Repeating the Telekinesis Catapult Movement Method, I arrived at Area 4 before noon. The Demonic Beasts in Area 4 are quite formidable. The amount of opponents I can defeat with one attack decreases, and a fair amount of Durability is decreased by attacks from the other side. Where my Durability doesn’t decrease by the attacks of Goblins at all, attacks from the Demonic Beasts in this Area can decrease it by over 100 if I’m hit directly. (²)</p>

<p>And finally, while hunting Demonic Beasts along the way, I reached Area 5.</p>

<p>『Well, what kind of Demonic Beasts will appear in this Area?』</p>

<p>I use multiple exploration Skills to look for the Demonic Beasts. Finding the other party and landing a preemptive strike is very important while hunting, after all. In some cases, they can be defeated while I sustain no damage.</p>

<p>『However, there don’t seem to be any Demonic Beasts.』</p>

<p>I looked around for an hour, but I wasn’t able to discover any Demonic Beasts at all.</p>

<p>Are there perhaps absolutely no Demonic Beasts here? I had named this place Area 5, but is it possible that Area 4 actually had the highest difficulty?</p>

<p>As I thought so, I got a little impatient, but I was able to discover one at the edge of the area. There was a giant reaction in terms of Magical Power. (³) Undoubtedly, it’s a Demonic Beast. Moreover, it’s one of unprecedented strength.</p>

<p>『Uhyoー! What a strong magic power reaction!』 (⁴)</p>

<p>Until now, the Demonic Beast with the strongest Magic Power was a Flare Leopard which was in Area 4; it was a fire-attribute Demonic Beast with a length of ~7-8 meters. I could handle its Fire Magic, but its Magic Stone had a value of 47; it was a brutal fiend.</p>

<p>But this reaction exceeds it.</p>

<p>『Let’s gain a bit of altitude.』</p>

<p>I fly upwards as to not be discovered on the ground. Using Skills, I can conceal my Magic Power as well. Even though the level of each individual Skill is low, when combined the effects of multiple similar Skills, the effect raises. It’d be difficult to detect me if the opponent’s Perception Skills aren’t strong.</p>

<p>『I found it! But… What is it? A puddle?』</p>

<p>On the Plains, a lone Puddle(?) can be seen. It’d be ~5 meters in diameter?</p>

<p>But, from that Puddle, I can sense a strong Magic Power. Hmm… Is there something inside of it?</p>

<p>Should I approach it?</p>

<p>At first glance, there doesn’t seem to be anything inside of the Puddle.</p>

<p>『I should approach it a little more, and then Appraise it.』</p>

<p>As one would expect, Appraisal won’t work with the current altitude difference. I have to get within ~20 meters.</p>

<p>And so, I approached the Puddle.</p>

<p><em>*Burururn*</em></p>

<p>The surface of the water shook.</p>

<p>The wind? No, the wind wouldn’t be able to shake the entire thing. It seems like some form of gelatin? (⁵)</p>

<p><em>*Bururururururun*</em></p>

<p>The Puddle shook even more, and then overflowed like a fountain, making it give off the illusion of it exploding. Looking closely, it’s not water at all.</p>

<p>『Ugee! It’s a huge Slime!』 (⁶)</p>

<p>It seems that what I thought was a puddle was actually an extremely consolidated Slime. And so, I reacted by taking a fighting stance.</p>

<p>The Slime’s full length exceeds 15 meters. Its surface if Blue, but within its interior, it’s mixed with Gold. As for its figure, it looks like a huge <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gEWrtGQ7qHk/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">Steamed Bun</a>made out of water.</p>

<p>This is the first time I’ve seen a Slime this big. Ordinary Slimes are, at best, about 1 meter long. Even the higher ranked ones don’t exceed 2 meters.</p>

<p>And that body of over 15 meters contains transcendant-level Magic Power. It’s… A bit overwhelming.</p>

<p>『Well, first I should use Appraisal.』</p>

<p>Description: The strongest of the Slime species. It preys on the surrounding Demonic Beasts and grows indefinitely; it also has the ability to use Space-Time Magic to keep its opponent in Dimensional Storage, as to use them as a long-term food source. Its minimum Threat Level is C, but it varies depending on the amount of food in its environment; the highest reported Threat Level is A. It is said that such beings have preyed upon even Dragons. A subjugation force should be dispatched immediately upon discovery.</p>

<p>Magic Stone Position：The Center of its body.</p>

<p>Uwaー. This is a pretty dangerous Demonic Beast, huh? Infinite growth…… This fellow before my eyes has a description that makes it seem that it’s incredibly dangerous, but I had already expected that. (⁷)</p>

<p>Physical Attack Resistance and a Strongly Acidic Viscous Body? If I charge in badly, I’ll definitely be dissolved.</p>

<p>And Viscous Body Techniques is also a pretty nasty Skill. It’s a general term for attacks using the body of a liquid-like body, but the other Slimes I’ve seen only had it at about Lv4. That level was also excellent, as it allowed them to make their body whip-like to attack — but this guy’s is at Lv7.</p>

<p>『I’m getting the feeling that a direct hit is a death flag.』(⁸)</p>

<p>So, what should I do? Magic? My most effective magic is Fire Magic, but because it has Flame Resistance, it’ll be useless. As for other types of Magic, there don’t seem to be any that’d be effective.</p>

<p>The Slime Lord grows its body, but it still can’t reach me who’s at a raised altitude. However, it seems to have identified me as food due to its high Magic Perception.</p>

<p>Perhaps I could steamroll it with Skills? So long as I whittle away at it, there’ll eventually be a decline in its use of Instant Regeneration. With my battle experience against other Slimes, I know that their attacks using their acidic bodies will give subtle damage, even though I’m a sword. This fellow’s body is incredibly acidic, so I don’t want to have to attack it too many times.</p>

<p>『So, ーUo!』</p>

<p>The body of the Slime Lord bends slowly while its body quivers, and, like a gun, it shoots a piece of its own body like a bullet. A bullet made out of strong acid.</p>

<p>『That’s badー!』 (⁹)</p>

<p>Using a Skill to get a grasp of its location, I dodge it somehow. (¹⁰) But, with that attack it seems that I can’t remain passive. I don’t have confidence that I can evade attacks more intense than that one.</p>

<p>『Alright, fine. I’ll make this a brief battle. I’ll come with a single certain-kill attack.』</p>

<p>I set Skills related to high-speed mobility and destructive offensive-power, and throw together a combination that’ll allow the strongest Telekinesis Catapult Attack I can use.</p>

<p>But that’s not all.</p>

<p>『I know your habits!』</p>

<p>Using a Skill called Phantom Body, I create an illusion that looks just like me. This guy’s great, as it emits Magic Power similar to that of the main body, making it difficult to see through. (¹¹) In addition, when it takes a physical attack, its internal Magic Power bursts, generating a light shock wave. Its power is only to the degree of an adult hitting with all their might, but it’s effective as a surprise.</p>

<p>With this, my preparations are complete.</p>

<p>『Phantom, charge!』</p>

<p>Without a sound, the phantom rushes straight at the Slime. In response, the Slime Lord extends a tentacle. (¹²) And with that, the Phantom is struck easily. But that’s fine.</p>

<p>It surely felt the impact that the Phantom gave off. And so, the Slime Lord extends its tentacle once again for interception. That’s important, as while it’s defending,it transports its Magic Stone to the opposite side. Because its body is completely liquid-like, it can freely move the Magic Stone within its body.</p>

<p>But that’s just what I was aiming for. After all, that means that the body covering the Demonic Stone is thin on its back.</p>

<p>『Even in evolution, habits don’t change!』</p>

<p>I begin funneling MP like jet fuel, and rush forward.</p>

<p>In the end, it was nothing more than a simple dash. However, I put my heart and soul into this dash.</p>

<p>『For this attack alone, I intend to give it a name. I’ll name it: The Way of the Blinking Heavens!』 (¹³)</p>

<p>Because the tension was high I cried out my idea, but if I was calm, it would definitely be rejected. Maybe.</p>

<p>All sound disappeared for an instant. That’s the evidence of moving above the speed of sound.</p>

<p><em>*ZUDOOOOOoooooooo!!*</em></p>

<p>A mighty roaring echoed throughout the Plains. If I wasn’t a sword and had keen ears, I would have fainted in agony.</p>

<p>The Slime Lord couldn’t react, and a large hole was opened within its body. Of course, its Magic Stone was annihilated as well.</p>

<p><em>*BURuburuBURUBu*</em></p>

<p>And with that, the Slime Lord stopped moving, and spread out along the ground. It resulted in the dubious spectacle of some mystery-mucous covering the ground.</p>

<p>『Fuu, it seems I won…… Still, that was quite dangerous.』</p>

<p>Nearly half of my blade was dissolved by the mixture. If I was taken into him, I would have disappeared in an instant. And so, it was the correct choice to deal with it in a single blow.</p>

<p>〈 The effects of Self-Evolution have been activated. Self-Evolution Points acquired: 30 〉</p>

<p>Surprisingly, it seems that the value of its Magic Stone was 150. As expected of an advanced Demonic Beast.</p>

<p>Name：Unknown</p>

<p>Race：Intelligent Weapon</p>

<p>ATK：352　MP：1300/1300　Durability：1100/1100</p>

<p>Skills:<br>
Appraisal：Lv6, High-Speed Self Repair, Self-Evolution〈Rank 6・Magic Stone Status: 1516/2100・Memory: 40・Points: 53〉, Self-Modification, Telekinesis, Telekinesis ↑ Low, Telepathy, ATK ↑ Low, Owner ALL Stats ↑ Low, Owner HP Recovery ↑ Low, MP ↑ Low, Memory ↑ Low, Demonic Beast Knowledge, Skill Sharing, Sorcery</p>

<p>Now then, shall I also inspect the Skills that I’ve obtained here? There’re some Skills that seem considerably useful.</p>

<p>Here’s the first jab. (¹⁴) I can save the main Skills for later, so first I’ll use the Softening Skill which seems quite interesting.</p>

<p>『Ohh. I became soft.』</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem to be strong because its level is low, but my blade definitely became soft. (¹⁵) When I shake my body, my blade resounds with a <em>*myonmyon*</em>. (¹⁶) Interesting.</p>

<p>As for Mimicry and Hardening, I can’t see any effects. As for Instant Regeneration, because I have High-Speed Self-Repair, I wonder if it’ll do anything.</p>

<p>Well, those Skills were only appetizers; now let’s try the main Skills.</p>

<p>『Dimensional Storage: Activate』</p>

<p>It’s the so-called Item Box Skill.</p>

<p>A stone disappears right before my eyes. When I use it again, a stone appears out of thin air.</p>

<p>When I put a bunch of stones and grass inside, a list of stored objects is displayed in my mind. How convenient.</p>

<p>『Now, to test its capacity.』</p>

<p>If the amount’s extremely little, I’ll be quite disappointed. First, I’ll put a bunch of items in to look for the limit.</p>

<p>『Let’s start with this guy.』</p>

<p>I try to store the corpse of the Slime Lord, which was left unattended. Its mass is quite substantial; I think it’d be able to fill about half of a 25 meter swimming pool.</p>

<p>However, I was able to store it in an instant. And yet, it seems that there’s still space remaining.</p>

<p>『As expected of an advanced Demonic Beast’s Skill.』</p>

<p>It doesn’t mean much to me, but I think it’ll be useful for whoever ends up equipping me. For transporting stuff like food, for example.</p>

<p>By the way, once Self-Evolution is activated, my MP and Durability immediately recovers. Thanks to that, I’m completely unhurt. Mental fatigue, however, isn’t reduced.</p>

<p>『I’m tired, let’s hunt in low Areas for the rest of the day.』</p>

<hr>
<p>¹ Sword-bro has brilliant naming sense. Really. Freaking. Brilliant. ._.</p>

<p>² There was actually “無傷なのに比べて、” in the middle of this — right after the bit about the goblins — but it’s essentially just Sword-bro repeating himself and being redundant. Its translation is along the lines of “In comparison with being unhurt/flawless”</p>

<p>³ It’s literally “Giant” “Magical Power” “Reaction” here, so I translated it as you can see, but… Perhaps there’s a better alternative? 大きな魔力反応。</p>

<p>⁴ “Uhyo” seems to be an utterance of disbelief. It’s like this in Japanese: うひょー！</p>

<p>⁵ This line’s essentially saying that it’s more like “Agar” — which is a gelatinous-like substance. Another translation would have been “vegetable gelatin”. もっとこう、寒天的な？</p>

<p>⁶ “Ugee” is essentially “Yuck” うげぇ！</p>

<p>⁷ The part after the comma should actually be something like “it remains a dangerous opponent”, but seeing as it was already mentioned that it was dangerous just prior, it’s redundant. Therefor, I’ve changed the wording a bit.</p>

<p>⁸ I don’t have to explain what  are, right?</p>

<p>⁹ The text here is “Abbune!” which you’ve probably heard in anime. It looks like this: あっぶねー！</p>

<p>¹⁰ It mentioned a Skill that roughly provided a “Spatial grasp” of sorts, so I translated it like this. If anyone has a better suggestion, I’d love to hear it! 　空間把握と、回避のスキルで、何とか躱す。</p>

<p>¹¹ See through as in discover it’s a fake — not literally seeing through it.</p>

<p>¹² I can almost see all the “I’ve seen enough H*ntai to know where this is going…” comments.</p>

<p>¹³ So, the name’s actually “blink” (as in eye-blink) “Heavenly” “Way of the sword/killing method”. For the first two, it’s easy enough to put into a name… But the last bit changed the entire way the name would need to work, so there it is. If anyone has a better suggestion, let me know. 瞬天殺法</p>

<p>¹⁴ Sword-bro is meaning the boxing jab here, so I think he’s making the point of “weakening the number of Skills he’s obtained from the Slime Lord” here. まずはジャブ。</p>

<p>¹⁵ Soft as in “limp”. It’s 柔らかく</p>

<p>¹⁶ I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that *myonmyon* is a hyperbole for the sound a metal sheet would make if you shook it. ミョンミョン</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <p>Today, too, we’ll be exploring Area 5.</p>

<p>Because I fought the Slime Lord in the South yesterday, I’ll search a different direction today.</p>

<p>In the East area I discovered a huge Snake exceeding 20 meters in length: a Doppel Snake. (¹) The thickness of its body was like that of a Drum.</p>

<p>As its name suggests, it had a Skill called Fission Creation; it allows the user to create a body double which can imitate their original Skills, abilities, and so on.</p>

<p>When I defeated the first Doppelgänger and it disappeared like a phantom, I was really surprised. However, because its tactics revolved around using its double from a safe distance, the main body wasn’t actually that strong.</p>

<p>Its fighting power didn’t really exceed that of a Demonic Beast from Area 4. Once I found the body lurking underground, the fight was finished in an instant.</p>

<p>I used the Fission Creation Skill immediately after obtaining it, but……</p>

<p>「This isn’t the body of a Sword……」<br>
『It’s me from when I was living as a human.』</p>

<p>And so, the doppelgänger created by Fission Creation imitated a Human. At the same time, my thoughts were obtained simultaneously, so I was able to move my Sword and Doppelgänger body at the same time.</p>

<p>「Oh? If I do this, won’t I not need someone to equip me?」<br>
『Seriously? But what’s the strength of my alter ego?』</p>

<p>Wouldn’t equipping myself using my double be pretty good?</p>

<p>Or so I thought, but it didn’t go very well.</p>

<p>First of all, Fission Creation has a time limit. Currently, the limit’s 5 minutes. Second, the Doppelgänger is incredibly weak. With the exception of INT, its stats all had an average of 5 — weaker than even Goblins.</p>

<p>Moreover, its Skills were reduced. The Doppelgänger has the same Skills as my main body, but all of its Skill Levels were 1.</p>

<p>With that, the Skill can’t be used. I don’t know what would happen if I leveled up the Skill, but the Doppel Snake’s Fission Creation Skill was Lv9, which made its Doppelgänger body stronger than the main body.</p>

<p>Other Skills obtained from the snake such as Molting, Heat Perception, and Scale Regeneration couldn’t be used, so there was only one other Skill that would be usable. It’s a Skill superior to Poison Fang called Sovereign Toxic Fang. (²) It also had the Deadly Poison Fang Skill, but this Skill’s effects are above it.</p>

<p>For now, the Doppel Snake was placed into storage. Dimensional Storage still wasn’t full after holding that giant snake. Its capacity is greater than expected.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I headed towards the Northern area. Of course, I hunted down any Demonic Beasts along the way; after defeating them they were immediately stored.</p>

<p>After conquering the East, I understood that within the North, East, South and West there would only be one big Boss. I guess they would be Area Bosses? The only Demonic Beasts that I found strong were the Slime Lord and the Doppel Snake; anything else is probably just food for the Area Bosses.</p>

<p>So, the next area boss I would face was the one in the North.</p>

<p>『The Area Bosses always have strong Skills, so I’m looking forward to it.』</p>

<p>What was there was the smallest of the Area Bosses. A Turtle Demonic Beast; its Magic Power wasn’t at all inferior to that of the other Area Bosses.</p>

<p>Its overall length was only around 5 meters. From its shining black shell, 10 tubes stick out, with a thick gun-barrel protruding in the center.</p>

<p>『Blast Tortoise.』 (³)</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I’ve defeated a lower ranked version of this tortoise. It was a Demonic Beast called a Cannon Tortoise, which absorbed the surrounding air from tubes and shot it from its compressed barrel.</p>

<p>「GOOOooooOooo<em>!</em>」</p>

<p>It’s a form of Demonic Beast whose chosen form of combat is long-range bombardment; its detection range seems quite wide as well. Already, its eyes have become fixed upon me.</p>

<p>「<strong>Goo!</strong>」</p>

<p><em>*BOBOBOU!*</em></p>

<p>Compressed air bullets are shot consecutively. I didn’t think that it would be possible to release those continuously. For Canon Tortoises, it could only shoot once, and left no shots in reserve. Indeed, this is a superior race.</p>

<p>『Arayotto!』 (⁴)</p>

<p>Air bullets continue to come flying at high speed. I took a trajectory to evade, but……</p>

<p><em>*BOBON!*</em></p>

<p>『Nua!』(⁵)</p>

<p>An air bullet unexpectedly bursts, and I’m crushed by the exploding air bullets from all directions. It dealt almost 100% damage. Is this due to the aftermath? (⁶) Or, more importantly, being able to remotely explode them remotely… What an amazing power!</p>

<p><em>*Bonn!*</em></p>

<p>『Gu! Dangerous, dangerous!』</p>

<p>While my escape routes were sealed, there’s also the threat of air bullets in pursuit. With a direct hit, 400 durability is shaved off. In addition, I can see more being fired.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>By the way, thanks to Airflow Vision, I can see the incoming colorless and transparent air bullets. If I didn’t have that, it would have been difficult to avoid anything.</p>

<p>For the time being, I need to break through. I descended using Telekinesis Catapult to avoid an air bullet, and zigzag at maximum speed while continuing to dodge the barrage of air bullets.</p>

<p>『Don’t get cocky!』</p>

<p>I occasionally receive damage, but I gradually approach the Tortoise.</p>

<p>『I’ve got you!』</p>

<p>If I get this close, it’s my win. My blade plunges into the exposed neck of the turtle ー not.</p>

<p>『Ah?! Don’t run away!』</p>

<p>With a speed impossible to imagine from the slow movements of a Tortoise, it retracts its neck and legs. I attack the shell out of vexation, but it’s only cut a little. If I attack multiple times, I might be able to break through but……</p>

<p>『As if I’d permit such a thing!』</p>

<p><em>*BOBOboBOboboBO!*</em></p>

<p>The Tortoise who had retracted its neck began to rotate at high-speed. (⁷) Really, it’s just like Ga**ra. (⁸) And, like that, it scatters air bullets indiscriminately.</p>

<p>Precisely because it’s not directly aimed at me, it’s difficult to read, and thus difficult to avoid.</p>

<p>All around me air rends the ground, but even if I take distance there would still be air bullets in the sky.</p>

<p>I try to move to the blind spot directly above it, but because of the perception Skills that the tortoise possesses it simply distributes the air bullets above.</p>

<p>『Ohtto! Dangerous!』</p>

<p>If the top is hopeless, then perhaps the bottom would be a better choice. It might not be able to attack on its underside, after all.</p>

<p>I play with my Status a bit while dodging the air bullets fired off by the Tortoise.</p>

<p>I managed to avoid the bullets while changing my Status without a problem due to the Thought Division Skill.</p>

<p>Using my left over Self-Evolution Points, I achieve Ground Magic Lv4; that’s when it becomes legitimately usable.</p>

<p>This fellow will be on the receiving end of this Skill, as I’ve become able to tunnel using the abilities I’ve obtained.</p>

<p>『ーDig dug!』 (⁹)</p>

<p>I dive into the hole dug with magic; the ending of the tunnel is directly below the Tortoise.</p>

<p>『Dig dug! Dig dug!』</p>

<p>But that’s not all. Casting the magic consecutively, I hollow out holes at the feet of the Tortoise. The ground, which couldn’t tolerate the weight of the Tortoise, sinks in, causing its big body to be swallowed into the ground.</p>

<p>『All according to plan!』</p>

<p>Furthermore, because I had dug the holes at an angle, the Tortoise does one rotation and falls upside down.</p>

<p>The Tortoise struggles to get up, but I sandwich it in place using Ground Magic.</p>

<p><em>Kukuku.</em> It won’t be able to escape in this state.</p>

<p>Then, The Tortoise takes its neck and legs out, only to attempt to return back inside. But didn’t miss that chance.</p>

<p>The fastest blow that struck down even the Slime Lord resulted in an explosion of the head of the Tortoise.</p>

<p>After all, it’s nothing more than a Tortoise. It wasn’t a match against me. (¹⁰)</p>

<p>『Victory!』</p>

<p>However, that was quite dangerous. Again, Area 5 is to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>Piercing into the Tortoise’s shell through the head-portion’s opening, the Magic Stone on the side of its heart was acquired one way or another.</p>

<p>Of course, I also store the Blast Tortoise; the storage still isn’t filled.</p>

<p>『Now there’s one less Magic Skill remaining. Let’s head back for now.』</p>

<p>The search of Area 5’s Western region will be put off until tomorrow.</p>

<p>I still want to inspect the Skills I got from the Tortoise for now.</p>

<p>After returning to the Pedestal, I try out the Skills; compressing the air as well as firing two air bullets seems possible. It went well, because the two Skills seem useful.</p>

<p>Air Bullet Discharge strengthens the surrounding air, thus “casting” the bullet. It seemed that through sucking air into the inside of its shell, the Blast Tortoise gained the ability to fire continuously.</p>

<p>As for me, if I use Airflow Manipulation in conjunction with Wind Magic, repeated shots also seems possible.</p>

<p>Air Compression can be used to compress air; at first it looks plain, but it’s actually quite interesting.</p>

<p>For example, I can add strength to the bullet fired from Air Bullet Discharge, or can make a compressed wall of air around myself as a shield. It could be said that alone it’s weak, but when used with multiple Skills it becomes quite strong.</p>

<p>『I’m happy that there’re a bunch of good Skills, but〜 in order to utilize them, more training is required.』</p>

<p>Strong Skills are pretty hard to master.</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 11: Departure for Lunch</h1>

<p>Wheew~</p>

<p>This chapter’s a good one, so I’ll keep it brief, alriiight~?</p>

<p>So, first thing, about Gentle Demon — I’m still doin’ that. But, because I translate Sword Bro with a higher priority, there’re days that I don’t get around to translating it. Otherwise, I’d probably have released at least 1 Chapter — or even 2 — since I mentioned I’d work on it.<br>
That being the case, I figured that I’d translate it to 100% before doing another Sword-bro chapter after completing the Chapter 10 of Sword-bro… But then this chapter happened.</p>

<p>And now I just want to translate more Sword-bro.</p>

<p>Dang it, right~?</p>

<p>So, while Gentle Demon’ll be put on the back burner for a while longer, I <em>am</em> in the process of translating it. It’ll be out. Eventually. Probably.</p>

<p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p>『I won〜!』</p>

<p>Raising my edge towards the sky, I raise my shout of victory.</p>

<p>I’m laying down on the ground after fighting the strongest boss of Area 5.</p>

<p>The Tyrant Saber. (¹) To be honest, I thought I was going to lose.</p>

<p>With a build exceeding 10 meters, it moved like the wind and could use three-dimensional movement combined with aerial jumps. Its magic-enhanced fangs and claws were completely brutal, shaving off only a little less than 500 Durability just by being grazed.</p>

<p>Moreover, its fur was coated in Magic Power — but even without that, its muscles were hard enough to resist my blade anyways.</p>

<p>In the end, I used up 15 Self-Evolution Points on Sovereign Toxic Fang, so my victory was decided at the end of a long war. With Appraisal, I had found out that its Poison Resistance was low, which is why I used it. If that wasn’t the case, I would have had no choice but to escape.</p>

<p>But, somehow the Saber’s movements had dulled due to the poison, so I continued to attack. When I finally defeated it, 4 hours had passed since the fight began.</p>

<p>However, the outcome was worth the risk. To start with: its Skills.</p>

<p>I obtained Vibration Impact, as well as a Skill called Vibration Fang Skill, both of which are frighteningly amazing.</p>

<p>The vibration from Vibration Impact is transmitted to the target when they’re struck, which results in a strike that’s capable of destroying your opponent from the inside.</p>

<p>Vibration Fang allows its user to amplify the sharpness of their fangs via ultra-high vibration; it’s the so-called Super-Vibration Blade Skill. Because both Skills had great compatibility with me, my offensive ability jumped up explosively.</p>

<p>But that’s not all. Combining Air Bullet Discharge with Vibration Impact resulted in a new Skill called Vibrating Bullet Discharge. It’s a fiendish attack which allows the same vibration effects to occur at long distance.</p>

<p>Another boon from the fight was that my Self-Evolution Skill was raised by a rank. Using Magic Stones from the Area Bosses granted values more than 150 each; that, combined with hunting in Area 4, resulted in enough to rank up.</p>

<p>Name ：Unknown</p>

<p>Race ：Intelligent Weapon</p>

<p>ATK ：392　MP ：1650/1650　Durability ：1450/1450</p>

<p>Skills:<br>
Appraisal：Lv6, High-Speed Self-Repair, Self-Evolution〈Rank 7・Magic Stone Status：2109/2800・Memory：47・Points：68〉, Self-Modification, Telekinesis, Telekinesis ↑ Low, Telepathy, ATK ↑ Low, Owner ALL Stats ↑ Low, Owner HP Recovery ↑ Low, MP ↑ Low, Memory ↑ Low, Demonic Beast Knowledge, Skill-Sharing, Sorcery (²)</p>

<p>Also, thanks to the rank up, I made a complete recovery.</p>

<p>『I still have time tonight.』</p>

<p>In front of me stood the mysterious forest.</p>

<p>It’s the forest-area which opens up to surround Area 5. The plan was to survey it earlier, but……</p>

<p>『So, what should I do?』</p>

<p>I’ve sustained no damage, and I have time, too. Shall I go?</p>

<p>『I’ve already come this far, and I could return without doing anything, too.』(³)</p>

<p>And so, I decided to explore the area outside.</p>

<p>ーJust in case, I didn’t immediately rush in, and instead decided to watch for any inhabitants by making full use of Night Vision and Heat Detection.</p>

<p>『Mーmm, there’s nothing……?』</p>

<p>There seem to be a ton of wild animals, but there’re almost no Demonic Beasts ー other than Goblins, of course. But it would be excessive to forcibly chase them around and kill those.</p>

<p>『Are the only Demonic Beasts around here small fry?』</p>

<p>For Area 6, I was prepared to enjoy victories over Divine level Demonic Beasts.</p>

<p>But this place is comparable to Area 1. To be honest, it’s quite a letdown.</p>

<p>『Ahー, as expected, I feel that my hopes have been shattered〜.』</p>

<p>In spite of carefully taking a stance which was set to flee at any time, it seems that choosing to observe the woods from the outside is making me out to be nothing more than a fool.</p>

<p>『That’s enough. I’ll go in at once.』</p>

<p>I jump into the forest using Telekinesis Catapult with a <em>*babyun*</em>. (⁴)</p>

<p>With that, I enjoy a panoramic view of the woods from above. There’re still no signs of any big Demonic Beasts.</p>

<p>『Ah, discovered a clearing.』</p>

<p>In the middle of the forest, there’s an open field where the trees don’t grow. I change direction with Telekinesis and drop towards that space.</p>

<p>And stuck into the ground.</p>

<p>『All right, landing success!』</p>

<p>When using the Telekinesis Catapult Movement Method my body’s at an angle, so making a landing sometimes ends up with me crashing onto the ground on the side of my blade. Such a landing deals hardly any damage to me, but I’d still count it as a failure.</p>

<p>A “success” would be piercing the ground with my blade, like this time. Somehow, it makes me feel better.</p>

<p>It’s easy to make a proper landing if I use Telekinesis just before landing, but generally I entrust it to gravity and drop down to make a game out of the success/failure count from landing. It’s one of my few pleasantries other than hunting.</p>

<p>With the ground conveying its texture through my blade, I get the feeling that this land is something like a swamp. The feel is wet and sticky like clay.</p>

<p>『Then, another jump…… Hm?』</p>

<p>My body doesn’t move. Is the quality of the clay-like soil higher than I thought? I invoke Telekinesis a bit stronger this time.</p>

<p>『I-Impossible…… Telekinesis isn’t working?』</p>

<p>Or, to be exact, the moment I activate it, it’s forcibly terminated. The best solution in times like these is to put my all into it. I accumulate Magic Power, and load it all into Telekinesis.</p>

<p><em>*pos*</em> (⁵)</p>

<p>A light sound seems to escape. And then, nothing happens.</p>

<p>『Impossible.』</p>

<p>The Magic which I used was absorbed into the ground. All the MP I had poured into it had been lost in an instant.</p>

<p>『Well, if that’s how it is…』</p>

<p>I try to use a Skill. My strategy is to use Vibration Fang to make a gap between my blade and the ground. But, it seems that Vibration Fang doesn’t work either.</p>

<p>Then, perhaps an Air Bullet couple provide enough lift? Once again, it doesn’t trigger.</p>

<p>Using Fire Magic, I can blow myself away! ーBut that also doesn’t work.</p>

<p>『Ehー…… What to do〜』</p>

<p>Taking a break from my escape attempts, I observe the surroundings.It’s nothing more than a forest; really nothing more but… It seems that the reason why Demonic Beasts of the Plain don’t go into the Forest is due to this Magic Power absorption phenomenon.</p>

<p>To higher leveled Demonic Beasts, Magic is important, so if they wander into the forest haphazardly they could get bogged down. Just like me.</p>

        </div>
        

<p>『The only consolation is that I don’t feel hungry……』</p>

<p>For a little while, I try to invoke other Magic Skills, but it seems that they’re completely nullified.</p>

<p>Because my MP isn’t absorbed from my blade, if I don’t continuously fire off random Skills, escape might be possible.</p>

<p>About my sight, because it seemed to be controlled by Magic Power within my blade, there doesn’t seem to be a problem.</p>

<p>After several hours passed, I noticed something.</p>

<p>『My MP isn’t recovering.』</p>

<p>It might be because the atmosphere in the area is lacking any Magic Power, but it seems that MP wasn’t being restored automatically. I still have more than half remaining, but I don’t want to waste it.</p>

<p>This is bad; as it stands, I won’t be able to get out by myself.</p>

<p>Ahー, how could such a thing……</p>

<p>* * * (⁶)</p>

<p>3 days have passed since then. There’s still no change. On the first day, I tried to find ways to escape using Skills, but I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s completely impossible.</p>

<p>I can’t use any Magic, not to mention attack Skills; even Telepathy isn’t possible.</p>

<p>All I can do is hope for a other creatures passing by and accidentally pulling me out by chance.</p>

<p>Or perhaps a natural disaster miraculously occurring and blowing me away.</p>

<p>A Human coming along and pulling me out would be the best result, but…</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>10 days have now passed since I’ve been stuck. (⁷)</p>

<p>Please forgive me.</p>

<p>I hadn’t paid attention to the reality of the situation. It doesn’t need to be a Human. I’ll sincerely apologize to all of the Goblins I’ve killed, because I’m no longer able to call them EXP anymore. So please, someone release me.</p>

<p>After you release me, I’ll follow you for life. Anything would be fine. Even a Zombie Kobold.</p>

<p>Please.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>One month has passed.</p>

<p>Because I’m a good sword, please pick me up. Please!</p>

<p>I’m of excellent quality, you know? I’m something of a Magic Sword. I’m not sure, but I don’t think there’re many like me, you know?</p>

<p>I can even cook.</p>

<p>I have a bunch of Skills, too.</p>

<p>If I use Points, I can even level them up if you’d like.</p>

<p>Look, look! Cooking Lv10!</p>

<p>〈 Cooking has reached LvMax; bonus Stats will be attached to the Cooking Skill 〉<br>
〈 A new item has been added to the Self-Evolution Bonuses 〉</p>

<p>Would Dismantling be useful too? Wouldn’t it be convenient? I can level this up too. Hey look, another Lv10!</p>

<p>〈 Dismantling has reached LvMax; bonus Stats will be awarded to the Dismantling Skill 〉</p>

<p>I also have Appraisal. It can be improved too, you know? Hey, I raised it by 1 Level.</p>

<p>Aren’t I amazing?</p>

<p>My combat capabilities are even higher, you know?</p>

<p>Both Swordsmanship and Sword Arts are Lv7.</p>

<p>If you’d like, I could also grant Magic Skills, you know? Look, Fire Magic Lv10! How is it?</p>

<p>〈 Fire Magic has reached LvMax; Blaze Magic Lv1 had been learnt 〉</p>

<p>! Well well, there was even more on top of that! How about it? There’s nothing to lose through picking me up, you know?</p>

<p>This Skill, too ーー(⁸)</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>「ー……!」</p>

<p>Ah. I was too eager to see people and had an auditory hallucination. It seems that I’ve already gone terminal.</p>

<p>「ー! …… T–t wa-ー!」</p>

<p>Eh? Could this auditory hallucination be real?</p>

<p><em>*<strong>Gatagata</strong>gata<strong>gata</strong>!*</em></p>

<p>A slight vibration is transmitted through the ground. What is it?</p>

<p>「Sti– Ch–i-gー」<br>
「!…… I’– ca–y –u! Wha–」</p>

<p>It’s a Human’s voice!</p>

<p>A human came! Thank you, God!</p>

<p>Hey, I’m over here! I’m stuck! Don’t I seem like a legendary sword? That being the case, pull me out! Please!</p>

<p><em>*Gata<strong>gataga</strong>tag<strong>ata</strong>!*</em></p>

<p>The real identity of the noise was the wheel of a carriage. The covered wagon appears from out of the forest.</p>

<p>But isn’t it going to fast? If you turn with such a speedー</p>

<p>Just like that, the carriage overturned in front of me.</p>

<p><em>*<strong>Gashanー!</strong>*</em></p>

<p>Uwaahー! Are the people inside alright? But why were they in such a rush? They seem to have been chased by something.</p>

<p>For now I can’t talk, so I can only watch over them. A person crawls out from the carriage while I anxiously worried over the safety of its riders.</p>

<p>Ohh, it looks like they’re safe. He had the cliché appearance of a Merchant from a fantasy game. Speaking of appearances that use a similar overcoat, would it be easier to understand if I described his appearance as similar to that of a merchant from Dr**n Qu**t 3? (⁹)</p>

<p>In addition, a small subordinate-like small man comes out. After the small man called out, several men and women also came out.</p>

<p>But…… Their appearance is terrible.</p>

<p>Wearing tattered clothing which clearly wasn’t washed, their clothes are hardly clothing at all, because they’re only tied to their bodies with a single string each. Their hair is dirty as well, and big collars are fitted around their necks.</p>

<p>『Slaves… There’s slavery in this world?』</p>

<p>Well, I’m slightly disappointed. My precious feelings of a different world have been tainted. ー Slaves aren’t particularly bad, of course. I just thought that the Humans of this world would have been a little different from my former one.</p>

<p>「Have the Slaves carry the luggage!」<br>
「Come on, do it now! Hey, you, hurry up! Take the luggage!」<br>
「Uuu…」<br>
「Do it quickly you half-wit!」</p>

<p>Uwa〜 what scum. It’s Human waste. The little man beats a slave burdened with heavy baggage with a whip. Just looking at that, I start to feel sick.</p>

<p>「It’s coming!」<br>
「<em>Hiii!</em> Come on!」</p>

<p>And, the cause of their panic appeared.</p>

<p>「<strong><em>Gurururu</em></strong>」</p>

<p>It was a Demonic Beast: A Bear with two heads.</p>

<hr>
<p>¹ As in Saber-Tooth Tiger — not a sword. The actual translation is “Tyrant Saber Tiger”, which I would have changed to “Tyrant Saber-Toothed Tiger” but that’s kind of a mouthful. Thus the translation. 　タイラント・サーベルタイガー。</p>

<p>² Changed Magic -&gt; Sorcery (Because it’s actually always supposed to be “Magician/Sorcerer”, but I couldn’t find anything better than “Magic” until now. But the story uses a lot of terms that involve “Magic”, like in manipulation, the amount of Magic stored in oneself (MP), Magic Power/Strength (MGC), etc. All previous chapters have been updated as well.</p>

<p>³ In the second half of the sentence (after the comma) I’m pretty sure sword-bro is just saying that he can leave without any trouble, but I’m not sure. 何もせずに引き返してもな</p>

<p>⁴ Babyun = Whoosh; should I continue using the Japanese pronunciation? Or perhaps change it to the western norm? バビュン</p>

<p>⁵ Literally “POS”. Any better suggestions? ポス</p>

<p>⁶ The Author actually just used a double-space to represent the time change. I’ve changed it to three asterisks to make it more visible.</p>

<p>⁷ All of these lines were supposed to be in one paragraph — probably to display Sword-bro’s growing desperation — but because it just makes it look like a wall of text instead, I’ve separated the lines to create partial pauses with the same effect.</p>

<p>⁸ See ⁷.</p>

<p>⁹ Reference to a Merchant from Dragon Quest 3. I think. ドラ〇ンクエスト3</p>

                    <br>

        <h1>Can a Sword mofu a Kemonomimi?</h1>

<p>There’s an actual Author’s note this time~!</p>

<p>I’ve remodeled the Status Display and put it into the “Preformatted” font for this chapter. Tell me what you think about it; revert, or keep it? I’ll change all previous chapter according to the opinions on it!</p>

<p>Also, I hate the word Kemonomimi! Not the word itself, but the process of translating it from Japanese to English!</p>

<p>Sword-bro’s mean for putting that in this chapter more than once. It takes time, you know~? You mess up my machines, you know~?</p>

<p>Complaining aside: here’s the chapter.</p>

<p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p>Author’s Note: Cruel Descriptions? (¹)</p>

<hr>
<p>Panic reaches the Slaves and Merchants who are faced with the 2-headed Bear running out of the bush.</p>

<p>“The Horse-drawn carriage was being attacked by Demonic Beasts of the forest.” That would probably be an appropriate way to describe this situation.</p>

<p>The Merchant was in a hurry to put part of the load on the slaves, but then a different order was commanded of them.</p>

<p>「Slaves, hold it back!」</p>

<p>The Merchant would take that chance to run away.</p>

<p>The slaves don’t even have any weapons. The only reason they’d be sent out is to be eaten and buy some time. Even the Slaves should understand that much. But they obeyed the words of the Merchant and headed towards the Bear.</p>

<p>Why? The thought had crossed my mind when I first saw them, but perhaps they’re bound by Magic or something? The Magic Power absorption of this land doesn’t act on the body, so it doesn’t seem to interfere with whatever Magic was used to make the contract.</p>

<p>A tree’s trunk was cut down, and a male Slave was blown away. With only one shot, the lower half of his body bid farewell to his upper half. Despite being a low-class Demonic Beast with only a Threat Level of F, it isn’t an opponent that can be confronted without decent equipment. These Slaves are simply too powerless in the face of the Demonic Beast, which is the personification of violence.</p>

<p>If this keeps up, it’ll only take a couple of minutes for the Slaves to be completely annihilated.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, but I can’t do anything about it since even my voice has been taken. The only one capable of getting away from this situation unscathed is the piece of trash formerly known as the Merchant.</p>

<p>Damn it! If only someone pulled me out!</p>

<p>While I aimlessly though so, a figure stood before me.</p>

<p>A Slave girl. But even though the girl was dirty, her hair wasn’t unkempt; it was done up and fastened in place.</p>

<p>And her ears… They’re cat ears. On the top of her head, she had the mark of an animal! ー It’s a Beastman! (²) It’s a Mofumimi! (³)</p>

<p>I forgot the terrible scene unfolding in the area and was momentarily impressed. Well, Cat Ears are a treasure of the world, right? It’s hard not to be moved.</p>

<p>Ahh, come on already! The inability to let out my voice is so irritating!</p>

<p>And the Girl… Pulls on me. ー Please, I want to immediately mofu this Nekomimi! No, wait. How could I mofu with the body of a sword? Telekinesis? No, no. Since I have a sense of touch, if I can gently do it with the side of my bladeー</p>

<p>The girl continued to cling to me with all her strength.</p>

<p>She was told to die, but is still adamant about living. She’s one that doesn’t give up. This girl. I want this girl to use me.</p>

<p>『……』</p>

<p>The girl puts more force into her grip. Come on! Pull me out!</p>

<p>However, it seems that I was more firmly stuck into the ground than I imagined. Judging by appearances, she’s only about 12, give or take 3 years? It’s to my understanding that she wasn’t given enough food, so she’s quite skinny. With the powerless arm of such a girl, it mustn’t be easy to pull me out.</p>

<p>Hang in there! Do your best! Or rather, look behind you!</p>

<p>Just like that, the Bear was approaching behind the girl. As for the other Slaves… It was hopeless.</p>

<p>Only the girl remains.</p>

<p>『Pull me out!』<br>
「…? A voice?」<br>
『You, can you hear my voice?!』<br>
「Who…?」<br>
『The sword. I’m the sword which you’ll pull out.』<br>
「…… How surprising.」<br>
『You don’t seem surprised…』<br>
「I am.」<br>
『Enough of this, the Bear is coming! Pull me out quickly, girl!』</p>

<p>Talking seems possible under the condition that we’re touching, it seems. The girl seems to be the expressionless &amp; taciturn type of person. Good! Please, say “idiot”! (⁴)</p>

<p>The girl groans and puts more power into her arms.</p>

<p><em>*Zuzu*</em></p>

<p>『I moved a little!』<br>
「Uuーn…」<br>
『Do your best!』</p>

<p><em>*Zuzuzu*</em></p>

<p>『Just a little more!』<br>
「Nunu…!」</p>

<p><em>*Zubo!*</em></p>

<p>『I’m out!』<br>
「Beautiful sword.」<br>
『Thank you, but that’s not the case!』<br>
「It is.」<br>
『Can you fight?』<br>
「A little.」</p>

<p>I confirm the status of the girl.</p>

        </div>
        

<p>『Equip me!』<br>
「Already equipped.」<br>
『You need to go further! Properly imagine equipping me!』<br>
「? Alright.」</p>

<p>〈 Nameless has been registered as equipped 〉</p>

<p>Alright, this’ll be the first time I’ve used Skill-Sharing.</p>

<p>〈 Nameless has received multiple Titles 〉</p>

<p>『Oh? What’s this all of a sudden?』</p>

<p>Attempting to use Appraisal…… Isn’t possible. (⁶)</p>

<p>The girl had received the Titles: Master of Fire, Cooking King, Dismantling King, and Skill Collector; those four. When Skills become LvMax, that seems to occur. Their respective Skills have their effects increased, and in the case of Skill Collector, proficiency acquisition seems to become more efficient.</p>

<p>Well, I’ll leave it for now. Such information isn’t exactly helpful right now.</p>

<p>『Fight. You should be able to.』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
『Defeat that guy. (⁷) Believe in yourself, and wield me!』</p>

<p>The Swordsmanship Skill should be able to deal with the situation somehow. The opponent’s a lower-rank Demonic Beast, anyways. With Swordsmanship Lv7, losing is impossible. There’re other Status ↑ effects in place as well.</p>

<p>「…… Yes. I understand.」<br>
『Alright, good girl.』<br>
「…… <em>Yaa!</em>」</p>

<p>The poise of the girl was absolutely beautiful. With movements befitting an expert swordsman, she moved closer to the Bear and, with a single strike, she pierced it right through the heart. It was as if I had hit tofu, as I was met with absolutely no resistance.</p>

<p>「Eh?」<br>
『You were able to do it. How was it?』<br>
「…… Yes. Is that thanks to you?」<br>
『Indeed. Won’t you thank me?』<br>
「Thank you.」</p>

<p>After saying so, the girl prepared to put me back into the ground, so I stopper her in a hurry.</p>

<p>『Wait! Don’t put me back into the ground!』<br>
「 ? 」<br>
『Because of the ground here, I can’t do anything. Therefore, take me with you for a while.』<br>
「Uuーn?」<br>
『What’s wrong?』<br>
「You would be taken, probably.」<br>
『By the Slave Merchants?』<br>
「Yes.」</p>

<p>That would be unpleasant. Even though I had found a Mofumimi girl with much effort… I want this girl to use me! Even if I’m taken away by a Merchant and sold to a connoisseur, to be sealed once again would be a much worse result!</p>

<p>『Why not escape?』<br>
「Impossible. I can’t defy them because of the collar.」<br>
『Is it some form of Magic Tool?』<br>
「Yes. Even though I’ve tried to kill them multiple times, it’s impossible.』<br>
『You’ve tried to kill the Slave Traders?』<br>
「Yes. I’ve tried to kill them and escape.」</p>

<p>I see. This girl was more bloodthirsty than I thought. But it’s not like I dislike that.</p>

<p>『So, it was impossible because of the collar.』<br>
「Yes.」</p>

<p>While talking with the girl, I saw a man running from the other side of the forest. It’s the Slave Merchant. By the way, the little man had already passed away. His corpse is sprawled out just a little ways away.</p>

<p>「Only one’s alive?! I’m ruined! Such a heavy loss ー shit!」</p>

<p>There’s no sign of the man mourning over the deaths of the Slaves, or even his subordinate. Rather, he was lamenting his broken cargo. He’s so shitty that it’s refreshing.</p>

<p>「……」<br>
「Did you defeat the Twin-Headed Bear?」<br>
「Yes.」<br>
「How did you…… What is that sword?」<br>
「I picked it up.」<br>
「Give it to me.」<br>
「…… Un.」<br>
「Hey, what’s with those eyes, huh?!」<br>
「I’m sorry, I’ll do it.」<br>
「Tch. Damn beasts with their gloomy eyes.」<br>
「Ah…!」</p>

<p>Suddenly, the man strikes the girl. Seriously? It’s a feeling that I’m used to, but… From the girl who was now crouching on the ground, the man forcefully took me away.</p>

<p>「Hoo… Isn’t this sword beautiful? Won’t this be able to make up my losses?」</p>

<p>While ignoring the groans of pain coming from the girl, the man began appraising me.</p>

<p>「Hey, beast. Load the goods that’re still salvageable. Then, we’ll depart for town.」</p>

<p>Because of the Slave Contract, the girl can’t go against the will of the man. She stood up aimlessly while dragging her body, which much have been aching.</p>

<p>Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting. With just that, my killing intent is at its peak. Damn it! If not for the Magic Absorption in this place, I would have killed this guy already!</p>

<p>「–<em>Kupe</em>?」</p>

<p>When I thought of using Telekinesis, it was possible. .</p>

<p>No, for some reason, it seems that the Magic Power absorption was weakened after leaving the ground. When I was stuck into the ground the absorption was instant, but now there’s a postponement of about one second until it’s absorbed.</p>

<p>And so, while thinking that I wanted to kill the Slave Trader, I used Telekinesis with all my power and swung vigorously. As a result, I completely pierced the face of the Slave Trader, splitting his skull hard enough for his brain fluid to burst out.</p>

<p>Ah. I did it?</p>

<p>Uuーm. Maybe because he was a piece of shit? Or, perhaps it’s because I’m a sword? Either way, the feeling of guilt doesn’t come out at all. When I killed a Goblin for the first time there was a slight aching in my conscience, though.</p>

<p>『Well, what should we do now?』<br>
「 ? 」</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <p>『Calm down. First, let’s confirm the situation.』<br>
「I am calm.」<br>
『You’re too calm.』</p>

<p>This girl is more self-paced than I thought. I have a premonition she’ll be very successful.</p>

<p>『You have now become my wielder.』<br>
「Yes.」<br>
『ーAnyways, I’m a Magic Sword more or less. I should be quite strong…… Or so I believe.』<br>
「Yes.」<br>
『That’s why, I want you to use me as your sword. Even if you want to stow me away, it’s alright. But you… Do you intend to use me? In other words, will you use me to slay Demonic Beasts?』</p>

<p>Indeed, a girl shouldn’t simply be forced to live such a life.</p>

<p>Because I’ve been equipped for the first time, I have the feeling of wanting this girl to use me, but if she says she doesn’t want to, I’ll give up.</p>

<p>「I want to use you. Definitely want to use you.」</p>

<p>An immediate response. That figure which grasped onto my hilt tightly was as dignified as they come.</p>

<p>「I will become stronger. Absolutely.」</p>

<p>What circumstances would motivate her to this extent?</p>

<p>『What is your goal?』<br>
「Break through the wall.」<br>
『The wall? What’s that?』</p>

<p>While listening to her story, I discover that Beastmen seem to be a species that evolves, much like Demonic Beasts. There’re various conditions depending on the Race, but all evolved Beastmen receive respect from their people.</p>

<p>However, the vast majority of Beastmen die without being able to evolve. There seems to be a great difference between Beastmen who have evolved, and those who have not too.</p>

<p>The Black Cats, which is the Race of the girl, have had no one who has evolved throughout all of history. Because of this, they’re treated like underlings among the Beastmen. Her parents also pursued evolution, but ran out of strength in the middle of their adventure. The girl caught the eyes of Slave Traders, and was captured.</p>

<p>The girl has inherited the will of her deceased parents, thus her drive for achieving evolution.</p>

<p>『<em>Mh, mh!</em> What a story! A worthy reason! I’ll make certain that you’ll evolve!』<br>
「Really?」<br>
『Of course! I’ll forge you without holding back, right from the start; then, we’ll go into a Dungeon to level up! And then, evolution!』<br>
「Thank you very much.」<br>
『It’s fine! I wouldn’t pick just anyone to equip me! ーEr… That reminds me, what about your name?』</p>

<p>I still haven’t heard her name yet, even though she’s my important wielder. But the answer that the girl gave was unexpected.</p>

<p>「Don’t have one.」<br>
『Eh? You don’t have a name?』<br>
「No.」</p>

<p>Certainly, she had no name in Appraisal, but to really have no name…</p>

<p>『Why?』<br>
「Name disappears once you enter a Slave contract.」<br>
『Hmm? What do you mean?』<br>
「New masters usually want to decide on a name, so your name is erased.」</p>

<p>I see; so perhaps after using Contract Magic it’s forbidden to use their name? It’s like they’re Chihiro who had their name stolen by Yu**ba.</p>

<p>「My name was erased when I was 8.」</p>

<p>That means that she’s lived 4 years as a Slave without losing the determination to achieve her goal. It was surely a life wrought with troubles. She’s gained a little of my respect.</p>

<p>『Is that so…… Then, what was your original name?』<br>
「Fran.」</p>

<p>It’s the same name as a dog which I kept a long time ago, but oh well. It’s easy to say, at least.</p>

<p>『Hmーm. Then your name is Fran.』<br>
「Is that alright?」<br>
『Is that no good?』<br>
「No, it’s not no good. I’m Fran.」</p>

<p>She seems to be happy. She nods her head again and again. With this, it’s become easier to call out to her. But, from the words given from Fran next, I became perplexed.</p>

<p>「Your name?」<br>
『Eh? Me?』<br>
「Yes.」</p>

<p>In the past month I never talked to anyone, so I didn’t have to worry about it, but… I’ve never had a name, huh. How foolish, to have never noticed.</p>

<p>I have the name that I used during my last life, so I could claim that as my name. But that would be a person’s name, so it would be quite an odd name for a Sword.</p>

<p>But… Looking at my Status, my name is Unknown. Shit! If I had thought about it earlier, I would have been able to think of a cool name!</p>

<p>Something like “Cursed Sword Ch**s” or “Derfl**ger”! </p>

<p>『Well……』<br>
「No name?」<br>
『That’s correct.』<br>
「Then, I’ll name you.」</p>

<p>Well, that’s fine too. She is my wielder, after all. If Fran gives me a name she likes, then I will receive that affection. Besides, I’m apathetic towards what name I’m given, so she should call me what she’d like.</p>

<p>「<em>Uuーn</em>……」<br>
『<em>*Dokidoki*</em>』 <br>
「<em>Fuーmu……?</em>」<br>
『<em>*Wakuwaku*</em>』 <br>
「<em>Mumuー</em>…… I’ve decided.」<br>
『Oh! I see! So? What is it?』<br>
「Teacher.」<br>
『Ha?』<br>
「Teacher.」<br>
『Why?』<br>
「You’ve said that you’ll train me. Therefore: Teacher.」<br>
『Ahー. There’re no other contenders? Just that one?』<br>
「There isn’t. Best regards, Teacher.」</p>

<p><code>〈 Name has been temporarily set to Teacher 〉</code></p>

<p><em>Uwaahー!</em> An announcement came?! It’s a lie, right? My name isn’t seriously Teacher, right?</p>

<p>「Disliked?」</p>

<p>She’s as expressionless as before, but there’s a subtle anxiety showing on her face. Just a little. I can’t say that I hate it if you look at me like that!</p>

<p>『It’s not bad! It’s a good nameー!』<br>
「Yes.」</p>

<p>And so, Teacher was decided as my name. I can’t help but think that it’s not a proper name for a sword, but it’s fine so long as Fran likes it. Or so I persuaded myself.</p>

<p>『So, what shall we do from now on? Seeing as the Slave Trader is dead, what happened to the contract? Was it dispelled?』<br>
「It’s not. Collar didn’t fall off.」</p>

<p>Fran points towards her collar.</p>

<p>「The Contract should be at a Slave Firm.」<br>
『So even if a Slave Trader dies, there’s no meaning so long as the contract remains?』<br>
「Go to town: get caught.」</p>

<p>It seems I’ll have to deal with this collar somehow.</p>

<p>『Is breaking it no good?』<br>
「Mn. If broken: I die.」<br>
『Eh? Seriously?』<br>
「Seriously.」</p>

<p><em>Ohh.</em> Dangerous. I was thinking of just cutting it off.</p>

<p>『How should I deal with it……?』</p>

<p>Perhaps a Skill of some sort? When I thought so, I found some Skills I wanted to try.</p>

<p>However, because I can’t use Skills in this place, I have to leave the Magic Power absorption zone.</p>

<p>「Then, leaving the forest should be fine.」</p>

<p>I receive something valuable from the carriage, and we start moving. Of course, the Bear was also collected.</p>

<p>I have my blade wrapped in the carriage’s cover as a makeshift sheath, using the small man’s belt to fasten it to Fran’s back. Because she’s quite small I almost drag against the ground, but I don’t really mind.</p>

<p>Just by equipping me, her physical abilities are considerably strengthened. Fran seems quite surprised from that.</p>

<p>In less than 30 minutes we were able to pass through the forest, it was surprising indeed. Incidentally, because of Conceal Presence, we didn’t encounter any Demonic Beasts.</p>

<p>「Amazing. Teacher is amazing.」<br>
『Ahahaha, you think so?』<br>
「Yes.」<br>
『Now then, I’ll try out a Skill.』</p>

<p>First, Recovery Magic. I used Magic to try and cure her abnormal condition. There was no effect.</p>

<p>『Then, next is this.』</p>

<p>Next would be using Purification Magic, treating her status as a curse.</p>

<p>『Lv2 should be enough.』</p>

<p>It, too, was no good. I have hope in the next one, however.</p>

<p>Contract Magic. As its name might have suggested, my aim is to override the Slave Contract with my own contract.</p>

<p>Contract Magic allows its user to make a contract between the user and the target via Magic. Depending on its Level and the amount of MP used, I can choose from several contract contents. However… I cannot make a contract if the target doesn’t consent. I can only make a contract with one target at a time; attempting to making multiple contracts at the same time will result in failure.</p>

<p>So are the details of Contract Magic.</p>

<p>If the Slave Contract is using Contract Magic, I think it’s possible to overwrite it.</p>

<p>And so, I used Contract Magic with the image of dispelling prior Magic while making sure to also call the Magic within the collar out.</p>

<p><em>*pachi*</em></p>

<p>A small snapping sound resounded. I certainly felt that the Contract Magics had interfered with one another. However, my Contract Magic is too low, so it’s been repelled.</p>

<p>『Alright, this means that it’s possible to overwrite it.』</p>

<p>One by one, I use Self-Evolution Points to level up Contract Magic. Finally, at Lv7, I was able to overwrite the contract. As for the amount of Points used: it was 12.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>For the contents of the Contract, it was 『Range ：None ・Bestow Name ：Fran』. It seems giving other false names would also be possible using this method.</p>

<p><em>*pakin*</em></p>

<p>The Slave collar comes off naturally, due to the overwrite.</p>

<p>『Is your body alright?』<br>
「It’s alright. No problems.」</p>

<p>I watch the flow of Magic Power inside of Fran, but as she said, there’re no problems. Also, the Magic Power from the Contract Magic that bound Fran until recently was mainly based in the collar, so it it completely disperses within a couple of seconds.</p>

<p>「Thank you.」</p>

<p><em>Mmh.</em> The sight of a cat-eared girl being bashful! Beautiful things are beautiful! It was really cute! When you look carefully, it’s easy to see that she’s quite beautiful. When she grows up, others won’t be able to leave her alone.</p>

<p>That’s no good. I won’t allow it. You’ll have to defeat me if you want to go out with Fran!</p>

<p>「This.」</p>

<p>While my passion burnt by myself, Fran removed something from her waist. It’ the wallet that the Slave Trader had.</p>

<p>『What’s inside?』</p>

<p>I peer inside, only to find it having numerous contents.</p>

<p>There’re several pieces of money. Well, I don’t understand this world’s currency, so I don’t really know how much these’re worth. There’re Silver, Copper, and other such things, so it’s likely not a huge amount at least.</p>

<p>Besides that, there’re a couple of tools. They seem to be Magic Tools. Fran demonstrated each.</p>

<p>There’s a Torch which can be lit using Magic, a small pitcher which produces drinking water, and a Bracelet which has the effect of STR +1.</p>

<p>It’s not all that great, but it’s interesting in its own way. The Bracelet with STR +1, that is.</p>

<p>『Alright, what shall we do now? Other than your main objective, are there any prospects for right now?』<br>
「<em>Hmーm</em>. A town.」<br>
『Around here?』<br>
「Over there.」<br>
『Over there, you say…… About how far?』<br>
「Don’t know.」</p>

<p>Apparently, she had heard the Slave Trader speaking of a city to the East by chance. Because the Sense Of Direction Skill that Fran possesses, we’ll be able to advance in that direction somehow or another. As a result, her response wouldn’t go beyond a carefree 「There.」.</p>

<p>『Well, let’s head there then.』</p>

<p>And so, that marked the start of our journey.<br>

<hr>
<p> Reference to Yubaba from Spirited Away.</p>

<p> Both are references to swords of some sort. The first is a reference to Demonic Sword Chaos — or, Kaosu (魔剣カ〇ス = 魔剣カオス) — from the Rance Series. Thanks to <strong>Mesaphrom</strong> for pointing that out!<br>
The second is a reference to Derflinger — or Derufuringa (デルフリ〇ガー = デルフリンガー) — from the Zero no Tsukaima Series. Thanks to <strong>Mystletainn</strong> for pointing that out!</p>

<p> The sound of Sword-bro’s (nonexistent) heart palpitating.</p>

<p> The sound of Sword-bro’s excitement building.</p>

<p> It’s “Shisho” (師匠), so <em>technically</em> it could also be “Master”. <strong><em>Not the ‘Goshujin-sama~” type, though.</em></strong></p>

<p> The contents are actually 不都合のない範囲で、フランと名乗ること, but I essentially compounded the information. The bit pre-comma is saying “A range with no inconvenience” which, when separated into compounded characters = No Range — thus the translation. The second half is just as it appears; declaring Fran’s name.</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 14: The Walk to Town</h1>

<p>Through the improvement in Appraisal, there were some changes in the Status display. The first change was the mysterious “Magical Power Conductivity”. Fran didn’t seem to know what it was either. Is it the efficiency in conducting Magic? Really, I have no clue.</p>

<p>The next changes related to the display format of Skills. Different types of Skills became sorted, so it’s become somewhat easier to look at.</p>

<p>Oh, I also came to understand Self-Modification, which I didn’t understand thus far. Apparently, thanks to it new effects are gained once I reach a counter stop. (¹)</p>

<p>✧It can grant Superior Skills, which are simply be better versions of the Skill they’re derived from. To Skills that have reached LvMax, modifying it into a Superior Skill is a great bonus. However, these Skills are excluded from the Set Skills that I can share with Fran, and are usable only to me. This is, of course, because my own Skills cannot become Set Skills. Putting it into two categories for Skill Sharing seems to be impossible.</p>

<p>However, because it uses up 10 Self-Evolution Points, I’ll need to give serious thought to the Skills I want to modify. Why it uses Self-Evolution Points is quite mysterious, but because they’re primarily based in Self-Evolution itself, Self-Modification could be something akin to a support of Self-Evolution.</p>

<p>Along the way to the Town I teach Fran about myself, too. There’s nothing to hide, after all. We also need to know the proper truth beforehand in order to arrange an alibi of some sort for one another; that way we won’t be found out by others.</p>

<p>I taught her about my ability to absorb Magic Stones, Skill Sharing, my ability to increase the Stats of my wielder, etc.</p>

<p>「Magic Stones……」<br>
『Mhm. However, I just leveled up recently, so there’s a long way to go.』<br>
「Un.」<br>
『Ah, hey. What are you doing?』<br>
「Un.」</p>

<p><em>*Gangan*</em></p>

<p>My blade was pressed down into the middle of a Fang Rat, piercing the Magic Stone along the way. Usually, I would try to absorb it but she was a little unreasonable.</p>

<p>『Wait, wait! It’s no good if it’s just cut! It has to remain in contact with my blade!』<br>
「Like this?」<br>
『Yeah, like that.』<br>
「It was really absorbed…」<br>
『I can become stronger through doing this. We can also sell any materials we gain, so we should hunt Demonic Beasts proactively.』<br>
「Un. Roger.」</p>

<p>The journey up until this point has gone on without any problems. It seems that the Plains were quite special after all, as the Demonic Beasts which appeared outside of the forest weren’t very strong either. At best, they’d be equivalent to ones found in Area 2.</p>

<p>In regards to meals, it’s left to me.</p>

<p>When my sanity had been depleted, Cooking was one of the Skills that was elevated, after all. The ingredients are the Demonic Beasts stored within Dimensional Storage. Thanks to Cooking, I found out whether Demonic Beasts were edible or not.</p>

<p>Because Fran has the same Cooking Skill as me, she should be able to cook, but I’ll be taking charge in this area. This is the duty of a guardian, after all.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I also made absolutely sure that my Resistance Skills were set, alongside Absorption Enhancement, Digestion Enhancement, Predation, and other such Skills while meals took place.</p>

<p>Predation allows the user to absorb the power of what the user eats. I don’t know how much of a difference it’ll make, but there’s no problem with setting it anyways.</p>

<p>At present, Fran’s status looks like this:</p>

<pre>Name ：Fran 　Age ：12 
Race ：Black Cat Tribe

Equipment 
Regular Clothing, Bracelet of Strength +1</pre>

<p>For her Status, she’s overwhelmingly stronger than Goblins. In fact, she’s stronger than a Goblin King. She would be about equal to the Demonic Beasts and the top of the Orc Race in Area 3. She’s also changed from her previously shabby clothing into ones from the horse-drawn carriage.</p>

<p>Each of her equipments’ Stats have also been improved by ~20 per piece; this is due to the effects of Skills like Owner ALL Stats ↑ and STR ↑ Low. They’re quite the cheats. Like this, there’ll be no problem in a fight against lower-leveled Demonic Beasts.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>As for her Skills, these are the basic ones, but they’ll change often because I modify them depending on the situation.</p>

<p>The only problem at hand is money. The currency unit of this world seems to be “Gorudo” (³). From the Slave Trader we received 2 Silver Coins, and 24 Copper Coins. That’s a total of 224 Gorudo. It seems that’s along the fine line of having lodging at a hotel for one night.</p>

<p>The reason why I said “it seems” is because Fran isn’t an expert on the market of the world. It’s just general knowledge.</p>

<p>And so, the first order of business is getting money. Preparing Armor and such will be essential, after all.</p>

<p>Just in case, I have a certain prospect that we can use. That is, the corpses of the Demonic Beasts which have been stowed away in Dimensional Storage. Because they seem to be the main source of income for Adventurers, selling them as materials would be worth a little at least.</p>

<p>So, before arrival, we’ll dismantle the material and sort out the ones that’ll most likely sell.</p>

<p>Because the materials gained from high-ranking Demonic Beasts might attract unnecessary attention to Fran, we’ll have to sell materials from lesser ranked Demonic Beasts for now.</p>

<p>Well, that’s an issue for when we arrive at town though.</p>

<p>『Alright, it’s done.』</p>

<p>We’re in the middle of camping at the moment. Fran is in the process of dismantling the materials. Apparently, so long as I’m registered as Equipment, even if she’s not holding me Skill Sharing will still be in effect. The Status raises will also remain. So Fran can use Dismantling even if she’s a little bit away.</p>

<p>In one hand Fran held a knife, dismantling the corpse of a Demonic Beast lying on the ground. Deodorization from Purification Magic is also being used in order to keep Demonic Beasts from approaching due to the smell of blood. Fran set that up all on her own.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m preparing a meal . It’s a stew using the meat of Demonic Beasts inside of a pot taken from the Slave Traders’ carriage. I’m also making use of medicinal herbs harvested using Herbalism, so the nutrition’ll be perfect.</p>

<p>As a sword, it’s easy for me to cut up ingredients, and mixing isn’t a problem using Telekinesis. The taste should be absolutely flawless ーー Cooking is LvMax, after all. It’s quite regrettable that I can’t taste it for myself.</p>

<p>This division of labor will be the default in the future. I’ll be in charge of Cooking and lookout, and Fran will be responsible for Dismantling. I’ll take the Magic Stones, and everything will be either sold or eaten.</p>

<p>『Fran, it’s finished.』<br>
「Un.」<br>
『Rinse your hands with water.』<br>
「Aqua・Create」</p>

<p>Fran washes her hands with a *pachapacha* sound using water I created via Water Magic, with me as the source of MP. There’re no problems in regards to consumption. Because Fran is the one using me, my Magic can be freely used, so we’ll be able to generate as much water as necessary.</p>

<p>『Is the Dismantling finished?』<br>
「Almost. But one is impossible.」<br>
『Ahh, the Tortoise?』</p>

<p>For the Blast Tortoise, even at LvMax it seems impossible to dismantle with just a knife. Well, it can’t be helped. It’s a high-ranking Demonic Beast, after all.</p>

<p>The Tyrant Saber couldn’t be dismantled yesterday either. It’s an issue with the tools.</p>

<p>『Is it my turn today as well?』<br>
「Please.」<br>
『Mmh. Leave it to me. As for you, have a good meal.』<br>
「Un. Thank you.」</p>

<p>Now, I should dismantle it quickly before Fran’s finished eating.</p>

<p>“Correction”</p>

<p>It’s a Skill that could be said to be one of a kind; an amazing Skill resultant from reaching a counter stop: a Superior Skill.</p>

<p>And it’s worthy of the title “Superior”. (⁴)</p>

<hr>
<p>(¹) Counter Stop is Japanese gaming lingo for “When something reaches max value”, in this case, it’s when a Skill become LvMax.</p>

<p>(²) Previously translated as “Night Vision” — which it technically is. It’s spelt like this “夜目” whereas the Night Vision Sword-shisho has is “暗視”. To be honest, I knew that it was a bit different, but the Skills were practically synonymous. Now that Fran has both Skills however, I need to change it. Originally I would have made it “Cat Eyes”, but there’s a possibility that other Races will have the same Skill, so “Night Eyes” is the middle ground I settled with. As always, if you have a better recommendation let me know</p>

<p>(³) It’s ゴルド. That could also be changed to plain old “Gold” — but in the end it would just be a guess based off of the onomatopoeia, so I kept it as Gorudo. Tell me what you guys think.</p>

<p>(⁴) The Author makes a “→” here, which is essentially them referring back to a previous part of the chapter. For which part they’re referring to, it’s the part related to Self-Modification’s ability to elevate LvMax Skills to “Superior Skills” — I’ve marked it with a “✧” for easy finding if anyone wants to read it again.</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <p>It’s the third day since I met Fran.</p>

<p>We’re still walking towards the town. To others, I would be invisible due to the wrappings put in place while being carried on Fran’s back. If someone spots a loosened portion and sees me, then I have no excuse.</p>

<p>『Hey, will I be able to enter the town easily?』<br>
「Nn?」<br>
『There’re no toll fees or identification cards needed?』<br>
「I don’t know.」</p>

<p><em>*furufuru*</em> Fran shakes her head back and forth. Cute.</p>

<p>No, no, rather than that!</p>

<p>Fran was a Slave, so of course she wouldn’t have done any entrance procedures. But, because of that, I have no information to go off of.</p>

<p>『So long as anyone else is present, information should be obtainable.』</p>

<p>But even if I say that, throughout these three days not a single trace of people has been seen.</p>

<p>There’re no Peddlers nor Travelers — there’s not even any bandits. Why? If there were any thieves, I’d be able to beat information out of them at least.</p>

<p>「It’s not a highway.」</p>

<p>The Slave Trader seemed to move through a dangerous area for the sake of time. As a result, it was attacked by a Demonic Beast and wiped out. My condolences. Not towards the Trader, of course. He should have died alone without involving the Slaves.</p>

<p>『Hm? There’re highways, huh.』</p>

<p>It seems that the purpose of highways are to avoid areas where Demonic Beasts appear frequently — to skirt areas where Humans shouldn’t be, essentially.</p>

<p>『Where is the highway?』<br>
「It’ll appear if we keep walking.」<br>
『I hope.』<br>
「It’ll be alright. Probably.」</p>

<p>Four have passed after she said that. We advanced leisurely while hunting Demonic Beasts as we walked.</p>

<p>Then, we discovered the long-awaited highway.</p>

<p>『Alright! The road!』</p>

<p>The road is far better than the animal trails we had used thus far; even the grass is removed. Instead, the ground is worn through its long history of people coming and going; traces of wheels can be seen clearly, too. Without a doubt, it’s a highway.</p>

<p>Fran continues towards the town with her Sense of Direction.</p>

<p>「Mu, there’s a reaction of living creatures.」<br>
『They don’t seem to be people. Perhaps Goblins?』<br>
「Hunt?」<br>
『Just in case. We might be able to sell their materials, and their Magic Stones can be absorbed.』<br>
「Roger.」</p>

<p>When I nodded using my body in consent, Fran deviated from the highway and began to run. She’s already gained the ability to run between the trees like the wind using Skills like Leg Strength ↑ and such.</p>

<p>「There.」</p>

<p>It seems that their plan was to ambush anyone passing through, because Goblins had hidden themselves in bushes on the side of the highway. There’re 3 total. Fran erases her presence and goes around to the Goblin at the back of their formation. Without a sound, it’s struck from behind.</p>

<p>「<em>Fuu.</em>」<br>
「Gi?」</p>

<p>Its body is cut down from behind, and it crumbles to the ground with a <em>*gurari*</em> (¹)</p>

<p>「<strong><em>Haa!</em></strong>」</p>

<p>Because my Skill level has rose, the Sword Technique Double・Slash could be activated with reduced movements, thus cutting through the remaining two bodies. The Goblins didn’t even know what happened.</p>

<p>The entire battle had finished before the first body had even fallen to the ground.</p>

<p>「Teacher, please.」<br>
『Mhm. Leave it to me.』</p>

<p>After absorbing the Magic Stone, I cut off the horns of the Goblins, which can supposedly be used as materials. The remaining bodies were thrown into Dimensional Storage. It would be bad if I had left them unattended near the highway and a large Demonic Beast followed their scent, after all.</p>

<p>「Teacher, another Goblin.」<br>
『There was still one left, huh.』<br>
「What should we do?」<br>
『It’s running in a straight line, shall we take it?』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>Once again, Fran starts to run. However, an unexpected development unfolded because of that decision.</p>

<p>「Shit! Get away from me, damn Goblins!」<br>
「Giigigi!」<br>
「GuruRUA!」</p>

<p>A lone carriage was being attacked by Goblins. The Goblins numbered 6, while there was only one person on the side of the carriage.</p>

<p>『Perhaps the Goblins from before were on lookout?』</p>

<p>While their fiends attacked the carriage, they would watch for Adventurers; such was real plan, perhaps.</p>

<p>「Help?」<br>
『Yeah. In the meantime, do your best old man!』</p>

<p>After erasing her presence once again, a surprise attack from behind is launched. Three bodies were cut down using the shortened movement of Triple・Thrust. The power of three consecutive thrusts is weak, but against Goblins there’re no problems.</p>

<p>「I-I’m saved!」<br>
「<strong><em>Giii!</em></strong>」<br>
「Noisy.」</p>

<p>Fran, who suddenly appears her opponents, chops down the Goblins which raise cries of intimidation with a <em>*zashuzashu*</em></p>

<p>The final Goblin turns heel in order to escape, but Fran throws me and deals a decisive blow. Thanks to the Throwing Skill, its stomach is accurately penetrated. I intended to make adjustments mid-flight in secret if I went astray, but it wasn’t necessary.</p>

<p>「T-thank you, young lady. You saved me.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「You’re… Quite strong. Are you traveling alone?」<br>
「Nn?」<br>
「Well, you don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to.」</p>

<p>Fran is reticent, but it seems that the man misunderstood based off of her attitude. Well, I don’t want to transfer our poor information, so I’m grateful for that. Mentally, I directed Fran to keep the misunderstanding as-is.</p>

<p>「If you’d like, would you like to hitch a ride on my carriage? I’m headed towards Aressa.」</p>

<p>The name of the town we were headed to seems to be Aressa. The man of gentle manners in front of us seems quite determined, however. (²)</p>

<p>His aim seems to be obtaining an escort while simultaneously offsetting the favor we earned by fending off the Goblins.</p>

<p>However, because we wanted information, we decided to take up his offer. But shouldn’t the debt of having one’s life saved not be so light?</p>

<p>I use Fran as a relay my thoughts.</p>

<p>「You’ll hire me to escort you to town?」<br>
「Ah, yes. Of course.」</p>

<p>Fufun. Don’t force a smile.</p>

<p>「I want to know information in exchange. That’s good enough as a fee.」<br>
「Hahahaha, interesting! I like it! Get on!」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「The name’s Randell. You?」<br>
「Fran.」<br>
「Then, best regards on the journey, Lady Fran.」</p>

<p>I don’t forget to strip off the horns of the Goblins before getting into the carriage. I then proceeded to immediately ask him a question. Through Fran, that is.</p>

<p>「Do Goblin horns sell?」<br>
「Goblin horns huh〜, they do, but they’re terribly cheap. As a catalyst for Magic, its quality is the worst.」</p>

<p>Is that so? I suppose stripping all of those off was just a waste of time, then. Randell continues, however.</p>

<p>「But even if that’s the case, if you take it to the Adventurers Guild, you should be able to get a reward seeing as they’re pegged to be exterminated upon discovery.」</p>

<p>The description from Appraisal said the same thing, Thinking about it, that description is quite arbitrary…</p>

<p>The description clearly explained that Goblins were hostile to essentially everything, but in the first place, who wrote that description? God? If we assume that, then it would probably be God’s side who destroyed the Evil God, so the description depicting “Evil” would be biased.</p>

</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>Looking at it from a Goblin’s perspective, they might feel that justice is on their side, and Humans are evil.</p>

<p>Well, even if that’s the case I’m not complaining or anything. I just killed a bunch of Goblins, after all. Only good-natured people would feel conflicted in the face of that explanation. As soon as it was discovered, they would have a feeling of guilt. As for me, because it was written that they were “Evil”, I could simply use that as my excuse. Or rather, I should say that my desire to hunt only grew because of that fact.</p>

<p>That might have been the purpose that whoever wrote the description was aiming for. It could have been to kindle people like me to hunt those of the “Evil” faction.</p>

<p>As expected, could the one who wrote the explanation really be God? Come to think of it, when I was reincarnated into this world I had heard a powerful voice, so perhaps that was God. Then it’s fine if they’re a good natured person, right? Yeah, that’s how it is. Even if they tried to manipulate me, I wouldn’t know of it at least. Or perhaps that’s their strategy? No, no but………</p>

<p>Stop, stop. If I start doubting everything randomly without information, I’ll just be stuck in an endless cycle. There’s no harm at the moment, so I’ll just stop thinking so deeply.</p>

<p>「But really, I’d have never expected a group of Goblins to attack on this route.」<br>
「Is that so?」<br>
「Yeah. This is a road which is visited by Adventurers regularly, after all.」</p>

<p>Adventurers. They even have a Guild, this really is a fantasy, huh. (³) I’m looking forward to going to the Guild later.</p>

<p>「Personally, I can only fend off one or two Goblins at a time.」</p>

<p>By the way, Randell’s Status looks like this:</p>

<pre>Name ：Randell 　Age ：39 
Race ：Human 
Job ：Merchant 
State ：Normal 


Status　
Level ：20 
HP ：62　MP ：85　STR ：30　END ：31　AGI ：34　INT ：45　MGC ：40　DEX ：41 


Skills 
Transportation ：Lv3, Coachmenship ：Lv2, Negotiation ：Lv2, Arithmetic ：Lv5, Commerce ：Lv6, Spear Arts ：Lv3, Speech ：Lv2 (⁴) 


Titles 
None 


Equipment 
Inferior Iron Spear (⁵), Leather Breastplate, Spider Silk Overcoat</pre>

<p>Well, one-on-one against a Goblin he wouldn’t lose, but being surrounded would be pretty harsh. There’s only a difference of four levels, but the status of Randell compared to the cheat-like Fran is terrible.</p>

<p>「For some reason, the Demonic Beasts have become are a bit more active than a month ago.」</p>

<p>A month ago, huh. About the time I captured Area 5, then.</p>

<p>「Why?」<br>
「Not sure. Well, it might have to have something to do with Maokami Plains (⁶), though.」<br>
「Maokami Plains?」<br>
「You don’t know? It’s classified as a Rank A Haunt that’s located to the East of here.」<br>
「Famous?」<br>
「Of course. Although it’s inferior to the sizes of another 10 Haunts, it’s still Rank A.」</p>

<p>“Haunts” seem to refer to areas under the control of Demonic Beasts, Dungeons included. The Ranks have a range of G ~ S, with A being second from the top.</p>

<p>It’s not at the level of the 10 Haunts classified as Rank S, but Rank A is dangerous enough despite that.</p>

<p>In such a place, I hunted frequently. So, if you were to talk about the Bosses, they were universally recognized as Strong.</p>

<p>But that’s not what concerned me. I try to ask a question through Fran.</p>

<p>「Why is it called Maokami Plains?」<code>((See (⁶) to understand the stuff Sword-shisho thinks about below.))</code></p>

<p>In that Plain there were a few Demonic Beasts of the wolf type, but rather than one of them being an Area Boss, there was a feline instead. And so, I don’t understand why it would be called Maokami Plains.</p>

<p>「Legend has it that long ago, a Demonic Beast of Rank S called a Fenrir passed away in those Plains. In the center of the Plain, the Magic Power of the Fenrir still seems to persist, so the Plains seem to have the interesting characteristic of having weaker Demonic Beasts the closer you get to the center.」</p>

<p>So rather than some sort of barrier, it was actually the Magic Power of Fenrir? Moreover, it was a dead one? Without those boundaries I would have lived quite a harsh life, so I’d like to genuinely show my gratitude to that Fenrir.</p>

<p>Still, for what reason was I stuck in such a place? It’s quite worrying.</p>

<p>「I had heard that there’s some sort of altar in the center of the Plains, but I don’t know of its origins. It seems that various people checked it, but it remained unclear.」</p>

<p>『Eh? What about me? Is there no information regarding the sword stuck in the middle?』</p>

<p>「In the altar, was there some sort of Sword inside?」<br>
「A Sword? Not that I know of.」</p>

<p>『Hmーm. I thought that I would have been able to understand my origin, but I guess it won’t be that easy.』</p>

<p>Randell didn’t have any more information regarding the Plains. How regrettable.</p>

<p>「Maokami Plains is also surrounded by a special forest which has the special property of depleting Magic, too.」</p>

<p>I had quite the trouble with that already. I don’t want to enter that place ever again.</p>

<p>「Thanks to that, the Demonic Beasts of Maokami Plains don’t wander outside, but it’s not like it doesn’t have an impact on the outside either. You see, every few years there’s a sort of territorial dispute in the Plains, and a battle between Large Demonic Beasts occurs.」</p>

<p>I suppose that would be something like an alteration of generations for the Area Bosses?</p>

<p>「At that time, Demonic Beasts from the forest are sometimes scared off, and become quite aggressive. Being frightened by the signs of stronger Demonic Beasts, some appear around the highway. That’s why, it’s possible that the cause for the Goblins this time could have been another territorial dispute, see?」</p>

<p>That… Is definitely my fault. I hunted all of the Area Bosses, so the aftermath of the battle likely resulted in a turf war. . (⁷)</p>

<p>Randell was at a loss as to whether he would be able to retrace his path back to the highway, but in the end he seems to advance by force because he has to meet a deadline.</p>

<p>Hahaha… Sorry Randell. I won’t charge any additional fees for acting as your escort as an apology. So, seriously. Sorry.</p>

<hr>
<p>(¹) Sound effect for shaking violently. “Thump” would have been similar, but wouldn’t have the same effect.</p>

<p>(²) To get them on the Carriage, I think. しかしこの男、優男に見えて結構強かだな。</p>

<p>(³) I won’t ask why Sword-shisho didn’t mention how Adventurers were fantasy-like until now, seeing as the word was thrown around quite a bit. It’s probably just that the Author couldn’t find a good place to mention it, though.</p>

<p>(⁴) Speech actually uses “術” — which is “Arts” in all of the combat stuff, so I felt a little like making this “Speaking Arts”, but “Speech” is good enough, right?</p>

<p>(⁵) “Inferior” was actually from the Chinese “卑” character, which is “low/base/inferior/humble/vulgar”. Why Chinese you ask? Heck if I know.</p>

<p>(⁶) “Maokami” is a combination of “魔” (Demon/Devil/Evil Spirit/etc.) and “狼” (Wolf). They’re pronounced “Ma” and “Ookami” respectively. Because it’s a name, I stuck with an onomatopoeia.</p>

<p>(⁷) てへぺろっ。Yep.</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 16: Arrival at the Town of Aressa</h1>

<p>Just in case it wasn’t clear, “Randell” actually has two “l”s because it’s pronounced “Rand-elle” not like a weird spelling of “Randal”. Just thought I’d mention that so that your mental-reading is accurate.</p>

<p>What, you don’t read things by having a voice recite the lines in your head?</p>

<p><strong><em>Weirdo.</em></strong></p>

<p>As for notes related to the story, if you haven’t already noticed, I’ve changed the drop-down menu a bit for Sword-shisho and separated the viewable chapters by number.</p>

<p>It’s hard to explain, but I’m sure you’ll get it if you just take a look yourself.</p>

<p>The reason for this change is simply to keep the amount of scrolling necessary to a minimum.</p>

<p>Anyways. This chapter’s shorter than most… But that doesn’t mean I’ll do a double release or something. I had to finish off moving stuff that was stored in my previous house today, so I was occupied for a good 6 hours. Or maybe more.<em>*shrug*</em></p>

<p>Enjoy the chapter.</p>

<p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p>We continued to be tossed about in Randell’s carriage for two hours.</p>

<p>「Oh, I can see Aressa!」</p>

<p>Atop a hill, I saw what appeared to be walls. Although, even if I say that I saw them, it was still quite distant. It’s a distance that seems like it’d take another two hours to reach.</p>

<p>Still, it’s quite large. According to Randell, it seems to be the biggest town in this area, with a population of around 10,000. The only Adventurer’s Guild in the area also seems to be in Aressa.</p>

<p>That reminds me, I forgot to ask about something important.</p>

<p>「How much is the entrance fee of the town?」<br>
「Ah, it’s 300 Gorudo.」</p>

<p>Crap, I don’t have enough. What should we do? Goblin Horns seem to be too cheap if they’re sold to anyone other than the Adventurer’s Guild…</p>

<p>That being said, I should also ask about the prices of other things as well. That way, I can calculate the necessary expenses, and plan for the future.</p>

<p>「How much per night at an inn? A cheap one would be fine.」<br>
「An inn, huh… The lowest rank inn would be about 200 Gorudo. Of course, rooms like that would come without meals.」</p>

<p>I also asked about prices of other things. The average meal is 50 Gorudo, a loaf of bread is 10 Gorudo, a cheap knife is 300 Gorudo, and using a bathhouse is 20 Gorudo per visit.</p>

<p>Those seem to be the rough values, at least. 1 Gorudo is about 10 yen, it seems.</p>

<p>As for money… The coin rankings are: Copper Coins → Large Copper Coins → Silver Coins → Large Silver Coins → Gold Coins → Large Gold Coins. It takes 10 coins of the same kind to go up a rank. Even though Randell’s a merchant, it seems that he’s never seen a Large Gold Coin.</p>

<p>「How much would the Goblin Horns be at the Guild?」<br>
「One pair would be 20 Gorudo. Merchants would buy them for about 5 Gorudo per pair, though.」</p>

<p>Cheap! Goblins are really cheap! If you didn’t hunt 10 a day you’d be unable to pay the inn’s charges……</p>

<p>But what should we do? Even if we sold the 8 pairs of horns to Randell, we still wouldn’t reach 300 Gorudo.</p>

<p>While being troubled, my Presence Detection showed a reaction. It belongs to something further ahead on the highway.</p>

<p>I tell Randell to slow down, and then proceed to scout ahead. Regular old Goblins were hiding in the bushes, it seems. As always, we’ll counter using an ambush of our own.</p>

<p>The battle is finished in an instant with Fran’s swordplay and my Magic. While collecting the horns of the five Goblins, I catch sight of a sword one of them were carrying. Wooden Clubs wouldn’t be worth anything because they’re nothing more than large branches, but I’m sure that a sword would be worth something, at least.</p>

</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>『Lucky. If we sell this to Randell, we just might reach 300 Gorudo.』</p>

<p>When we return to the carriage, Randell buys the sword for 200 Gorudo. Its price was higher than expected.</p>

<p>「That much?」<br>
「It’s made out of Bronze, but it’s in good condition. Adventurers would surely buy it if it were put for sale.」</p>

<p>That really was lucky. With this, we’ll be able to enter the town. Of course, the horns will be sold to the Guild, too.</p>

<p>As we continued along the highway, we hunted another Demonic Beast, which Randell bought. It was a black bug known as the Black Beetle. Its length was about 50cm long. It seems that its exoskeleton is used to make protective gear for beginners, so he bought it for 20 Gorudo.</p>

<p>Still, Demonic Beasts are quite cheap. Its materials could be used to make protective gear, yet it’s only priced at 20 Gorudo? Well, I suppose being a lower ranked Demonic Beast would also contribute to that, though. Aiming for weapons carried by Goblins would likely be more effective. As expected, it’s the fate of Goblins to be hunted by me.</p>

<p>◇◆◇</p>

<p>「So, Randell, were you able to return safely?」<br>
「While traveling, there were a number of times it became quite dangerous.」<br>
「Ahh. Who’s the young lady?」<br>
「I picked her up along the way. I’ll be taking care of her Admission Procedures as well.」<br>
「Alright. Your luck must have been good for coming across Randell’s carriage. Randell’s quite strong, so having him around would be quite reassuring, right?」</p>

<p>Towards the words of the middle-aged Gatekeeper, Randell smiles wryly. In actuality, it was Fran who protected and escorted Randell, after all.</p>

<p>However, because revealing that fact would have been unnecessarily conspicuous, we decided upon the scenario of Randell picking up and escorting a young girl along his trip.</p>

<p>「Alright, that’ll be 300 Gorudo. Here’s your temporary entrance certificate. It’s valid for 3 days. Because re-entry costs money again once it wears off, be careful!」</p>

<p>Alongside that information, I had already learned that if one has an official identification as the town’s inhabitant, or an Adventurer card, entering the town seems to be free. Because of that fact, I wanted to hurry and obtain an Adventurer card.</p>

<p>「Welcome to the town of Aressa.」</p>

<p>Joining the Adventurer’s Guild doesn’t seem to have an age restriction. There is, however, an aptitude test that needs to be taken before the card is issued.</p>

<p>「Well, I’ll be heading back to the shop. I suppose Fran will be going to the Adventurer’s Guild?」<br>
「Unn.」<br>
「My store’s to the West of the main street, if you have time, please pay me a visit.」</p>

<p>After saying so, Randell went on his way.</p>

<p>Even as he left, he didn’t say anything else. Even though it could only be seen as naïve, he let a young girl that was walking along the road alone accompany him without even knowing her circumstances. Even until the end, he didn’t ask of anything but her name. He was a genuinely good natured person.</p>

<p>After we’ve collected some money, we should pay him a visit. A visit to the man who was our first companion on our journey.</p>

<p>『Well, let’s get going.』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 17: My Insignificant Doubts</h1>

<p><code>Ensig:</code><br>
Just so you’re aware, I’ll be changing some things in the previous chapter in accordance to . Or… I would have, if there was anything to change.</p>

<p>Yeah. Turns out Sword-shisho refers to what I <em>thought</em> would be “Monsters” as literal “Demonic Beasts”. This: 魔獣 — which could also be “Magic Beasts”.</p>

<p>One might think “Well, because they have ‘Magic Stones’ shouldn’t the change happen?” but that would be incorrect. This is because “Magic Stones” can also be “Demon Stones”. Yep: 魔石. If you didn’t catch on already, 魔 can mean “Magic” or “Demon” among other things, which is why this is the case.</p>

<p>I considered changing all of the Demonic Beasts into Magic Beasts — because not all of them will be “Demonic” I’m sure, but because a so-called Evil God was in a certain description, I’ll keep it as-is until an “Intelligent Demonic Beast” shows up. And by “intelligent” I mean “capable of differentiating good and bad, and thinks they’re ‘good'”.</p>

<p>And so, this chapter’s title was <em>incredibly</em> convenient, in that my doubts over the identity of Demonic Beasts was all for nothing!</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p>We walk over to the Adventurer’s Guild through the road that Randell had taught us.</p>

<p><em>Hーmm</em>. It’s quite a beautiful town. It looks like a European-like town from the middle ages. It’s got a good feeling of “fantasy” floating about.</p>

<p>Also, this is the first time since I’ve come to this world that I’ve seen so many Humans. That alone would be enough to raise my spirits.</p>

<p>I only became more excited, because we ended up walking within a large group of people, each of different races. There was an old Kemonomimi with a fluffy tail, a big-breasted woman who ruined my image of Erofus — er, Elves. (¹) There’re also a wide variety of other races walking about, like a bearded Dwarf.</p>

<p>Mixed among the crowd, I was able to see the figures of Adventurer-like people here and there, too.</p>

<p>After confirming a couple of their statuses, I find that there doesn’t seem to be anyone that can match Fran. I’d like it if we can find someone with a close status.</p>

<p>In addition: Fran’s sheer number of Skills as well as the levels of said Skills are overwhelmingly higher than most. The highest Skill Level I saw was from a guy with Lv5 Sword Arts. I know the difference between that level and Lv7 well.</p>

<p>It’s possible that if they utilized Skills or Status values, they might be able to win… Because I’ve fought on the Plain, I understand this fact.</p>

<p>Or rather, the difference of Status makes little difference in the face of Skills. But it’s jus because of this that I don’t think Fran will have a problem fitting in with adventurers.</p>

<p>But still, I couldn’t help being a bit depressed for a different reason.</p>

<p>The reason is the performance of the other Adventurers’ weapons.</p>

<pre>Name ：Good-Quality Steel Longsword 

ATK ：398　MP ：5　Durability ：600 

Magic Power Conductivity・F 

Skills ：None</pre>

<p>My form is equivalent to that Longsword, and yet… Its ATK is superior to mine. I have a feeling of loss as a sword.</p>

<p>To add insult to injury, there’s its material: Good-Quality Steel. In other words, Mithril and Orichalcum — the so-called legendary metals — lost to simple Steel. That… That’s depressing.</p>

<p>After that, weapons, all boasting higher attack power than me, jump into my eyes. 1 in 5 people would have one better than me.</p>

<p>And, hung at the waist of the man who was walking before me, was this:</p>

<pre>Name ：Mithril Alloy Dagger 

ATK ：423　MP ：20　Durability：700 

Magical Power Conductivity・D+ 

Skills：None</pre>

<p>『Ha… <em>Hahahaha</em>……』</p>

<p>I can’t do anything but laugh. <em>Aah</em>. I was <strong><em>weak</em></strong>. I defeated Demonic Beasts, thinking that I was so clever. But in reality, I was simply a sword with an excess of decorations.</p>

<p>「What’s wrong?」<br>
『Aah, Fran. I’m already useless.』<br>
「 ? 」</p>

<p>I explained the situation to Fran. About how I was an inferior Skill if you look past the Skills. More inferior to any random weapon, at that. Surely, it was some upstart nouveau riche who made me.</p>

<p><em>*pat pat*</em></p>

<p>Fran pats me after I finished the explanation.</p>

<p>『Fran……』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
『Are you comforting me?』<br>
「Teacher has Skills.」</p>

<p>Hm…? Wait… Wait, that’s right, girl! I may be inferior to the average sword in attack power, but I can support with Skills! Or rather, that’s my only worth! Then it’s decided! I’ll become the king of Skills!</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>However, it would be best to buy a proper sword, as opposed to an inferior one like me, right? You’ll have no choice but to use me for now, but I’ll buy a strong sword for you eventually!</p>

<p>Therefore, we should register with the Adventurer’s Guild, and earn money energetically!</p>

<p>『Alright! I’m sorry to have worried you. I’m fine now, so let’s go to the Adventurer’s Guild!』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>An excessive amount of time was taken because of my moping, but we’ve finally arrived at the Adventurer’s Guild.</p>

<p>『It’s large…』</p>

<p>It was considerable size compared to the surrounding buildings. The size was likely due to the amount of Adventurers which come here.</p>

<p>『I have a request!』</p>

<p>I’m all fired up! — Ah, but no one heard me.</p>

<p>The inside is cleaner than I thought it would be. I expected its interior to look like some form of dingy pub, with an overpowering impression and cluttered interior, but… The front desk seems like it belongs to an expensive hotel.</p>

<p>Well, if it looked terrible, I suppose that would stain the reputation of the Guild.</p>

<p>However, when a 12-year-old girl walked in, a considerable amount of attention was drawn. While we walk up to the counter, the eyes of the surrounding Adventurers are following us.</p>

<p>「Register.」<br>
「Ah, yes. Are you alone?」<br>
「Alone.」<br>
「Erm… This is the Adventurer’s Guild, so……」<br>
「I know.」</p>

<p>It seems that in this world, a 12-year-old girl coming alone to register to be an Adventurer is rare. Their weapons and protective gear are perfect, and so despite her only being 12 years old and giving off an atmosphere that shows discipline from a young age, the mumbling continues to increase. (²) Even when I was a child I acted better than them.</p>

<p>Fran doesn’t have any armor, either. Rather, her appearance is quite shabby, which would only be common for runaway slaves.</p>

<p>We’re too out-of-place.</p>

<p>I recovered from my thoughts once the Receptionist starts to explain.</p>

<p>「Anyone can register, but there’ll be a test.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「It’ll be a test of fighting forms, but is that alright?」<br>
「Good.」<br>
「Are you really sure? You could get injured…」<br>
「Unconcerned.」<br>
「Well… If anything happens, the Guild takes no responsibility.」<br>
「Alright.」<br>
「So, you still wish to do it……? I understand. Just a moment, please.」</p>

<p>She probably understood that Fran genuinely wanted to take the test. The Adventurers become a bit noisy.</p>

<p>There wasn’t anyone who started a quarrel, but the atmosphere is nowhere near welcoming. A child taking on an Adventurer’s test… It likely rubbed them the wrong way.</p>

<p>That would be natural. If I was in their position, I would likely feel the same way.</p>

<p>『Are you alright, Fran?』<br>
「 ? 」<br>
『Well, it’s fine even if you don’t understand.』</p>

<p>After a few moments, the Receptionist returns.</p>

<p>「Sorry to have kept you waiting. This way, please.」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>At the back of the Guild was a spacious area surrounded by walls on all sides. It seems that this is the Guild’s training ground, or at least something similar.</p>

<p>A rugged man is standing in the middle of the grounds. His height would be about 2 meters. He’s wearing rough black body armor, which looks like it would be sharp to the touch; he looks just like a High King ruling at the end of a century. A huge Battleaxe is leaning against his side, which doubles his overpowering impression. From behind him, I can practically see the <em>*gogogogo*</em> sound effects. (³)</p>

<p>If it was a regular child, they would cry as soon a they laid eyes upon him. Even I, who was used to the pressure of Demonic Beasts, was slightly surprised.</p>

<p>「Are you the registration applicant?」</p>

<p><em>Uoーo</em>. Through his glare alone, that powerful of intimidation increases.</p>

<p>「Nn.」</p>

<p>However, Fran doesn’t seem to be frightened at all. It’s the same attitude as always. My girl is a big shot! (⁴)</p>

<p>「I’m your testing examiner, Donna Dorondo」 (⁵)</p>

<p>There’re way too many “do”s… It’s difficult to say. He doesn’t look like a Donna either.</p>

<p>「The contents of the examination are easy. You have to fight me. If you’re defeated too easily, you don’t pass!」<br>
「Understood.」<br>
「Just so you’re aware, I’m not good at holding back. When I fight, I do it seriously. If you don’t want to fight, now’s the time to leave!」</p>

<p>The moment Donna Dorondo shouted that, a terrible pressure fell over us. Isn’t this obviously the Coercion Skill (⁶)? Doesn’t that mean that the fight has already begun?</p>

<p>『Alright, let’s do it!』<br>
「Nn!」</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p>Standing in the Adventurer Guild’s training grounds, we stand face to face against our examiner. There’s a fierce sense of intimidation in the air.</p>

<p>If I was still a human, I have the feeling that I’d kneel on the ground and beg for my life. But as a sword, so I’m fine.</p>

<p>Well, let’s see what he’s made of.</p>

<p><em>Ugeーe! <strong>Strong!</strong></em> In terms of Status it’s our complete defeat! This old man… His physical abilities exceed that of the Lesser Wyvern! In addition to that, he has a variety of Skills at high levels. His equipment is also at a whole other level.</p>

<pre>Name ：Greataxe of Heavy Wrought Steel

ATK ：650　MP ：3　Durability ：650 

Magical Power Conductivity・E+ 

Skills ：None</pre>

<p>650 ATK? You’ve got to be fucking kidding me! (⁴) That’s absolutely mortifying!</p>

<p>He’s also a member of the cool-named Race called the Kijin. (⁵)</p>

<p>The title of the Instructor is no joke, either. All the Adventurers we’ve seen thus far don’t hold a candle to this man.</p>

<p>This fellow is coming at us full-force? Seriously? This is a Beginner test, right? If it was a normal beginner, I can’t think that they’d be able to do anything but lose outright……</p>

<p>Ah well, let’s give it a try. Even if we don’t win, we should show off our abilities at least.</p>

<p>『Fran, are you ready?』<br>
「OーK.」<br>
「Let’s begin!」</p>

<p>The figure of Donna Dorondo becomes hazy.</p>

<p>And Fran jumps to the side immediately.</p>

<p>Go!</p>

<p>「One, avoided!」<br>
『Not good –!』</p>

<p>When I noticed, there was already an Axe right beside us in mid-swing. It was at a speed that would be unimaginable from someone with such a large body. Moreover, looking at how the ground is becoming hollow, his power is also immense.</p>

<p>「<em>Muun!</em>」</p>

<p>In addition to the already present swing, he strikes the Axe to increase its speed further.</p>

<p><strong><em>*DOGOON!*</em></strong></p>

<p>The ground was gouged, and stones became nothing but gravel, scattering across the ground. Fran’s bangs shift due to the wind pressure.</p>

<p>Hey, wasn’t that first strike just now incredibly dangerous? Even though it was only a grazing blow… I’ve already taken a serious amount of damage. This is too much, right?! How could you pass this exam with thus guy?!</p>

<p>『It’d be dangerous to run away… In that case, let’s attack!』</p>

<p>I refuse to wait-and-see. Before receiving another dangerous attack like that, I’ll go at him at maximum force. I won’t worry about killing him; the other side is overwhelmingly strong, and even if his HP became 0 his bracelet would simply become a sacrifice.</p>

<p>「<em>Haa!</em>」<br>
「<em>Ho</em>? This one’s quick!」</p>

<p>The blow was easily caught with the axe. Even when secretly supported by AGI and STR raising Skills, this person still overcomes it.</p>

<p>However, his win isn’t certain.</p>

<p>To prevent any continuous attacks against Fran, Donna’s lower body is bound by tentacles.</p>

<p>「<em>Nuu?!</em> <strong>Aria Destruction!</strong>」</p>

<p><em>Fufun</em>. Don’t be so surprised. Fran didn’t emit any Spells — she didn’t even chant.</p>

<p>To tell you the truth, I alone am capable of invoking Magic without any trace. And so, Donna Dorondo, who needs to deal with Fran, wasn’t able to avoid any Magic aimed at his feet. Contrary to his situation, Fran nimbly jumped backwards and released an attack.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>Donna was confined, and only capable of moving his upper body, so he’s at the mercy of Fran’s assault. All he can do is receive it. Eat it.</p>

<p>「――<strong>Tri・Explosion</strong>!」<br>
「<em>NuoOOhh!</em>」</p>

<p>Donna Dorondo was engulfed by the Lv10 Fire Magic. It’s am attack that’s difficult to prevent, as explosions come from three directions simultaneously. Of course, Fran had only pretended to invocate it; in truth, I had used that Technique.</p>

<p>Doing it this way, while I chant, Fran can hold a Sword Technique in reserve.</p>

<p>「<em>Fuuuu</em>… <strong>Dragon・Fang</strong>!」</p>

<p>This is a thrusting Sword Technique of Lv7. Moreover, Vibration Fang is used alongside it. The small figure of Fran rushes over to the large body of Donna, who can’t move due to the explosion.</p>

<p>I wonder if he noticed the real nature of the Skills that Fran was using? Donna Dorondo opens his eyes wide as his face makes an expression of surprise.</p>

<p>「This girl is……!」</p>

<p>However, even if he notices it, avoidance is impossible.</p>

<p>「The end.」<br>
「<strong><em>Guggaaaah!</em></strong>」</p>

<p>The attack pierced through to Donna’s flank, sending his gigantic build flying.</p>

<p><em>*Doon!*</em></p>

<p>His body, which likely exceeded 200 kilos., was blown 10 meters away and embedded into the wall of the training grounds.</p>

<p>I had only used this technique against Demonic Beasts, so I suppose this would be what happens when it’s used against a humanoid opponent.</p>

<p>But… Perhaps we overdid it? I don’t think he’s dead, but…</p>

<p>「…… <em>*Gofu</em>*……」</p>

<p>Excellent, he’s alive. While vomiting large quantities of blood, Donna Dorondo seemed to remain conscious.</p>

<p>Fran approaches slowly. Will you be using Recovery Magic? While I considered what she’d do, I was thrust before the eyes of Donna.</p>

<p>「Pass?」</p>

<p>Mhh, that was a composed decision. As for me, I had already completely forgotten about the exam.</p>

<p>「…… You… Pass.」<br>
「Understood.」</p>

<p>This fellow… He can still move? What a sturdy guy. Even though he was pierced through the flank, to my surprise, Donna Dorondo steps out of the wall and begins to laugh. Taking a quick look at his Status, his HP has already recovered to about 300, and his wound is closing, too.</p>

<p>「<em>Hahahahaha!</em> You’re the first rookie to have ever given me damage!」</p>

<p>His toughness is already monster-class, seriously. Does someone who can kill this man even exist?</p>

<p>「<strong>Donna Dorondo!</strong>」</p>

<p>I hear a deafening roar, followed by the receptionist rushing over.</p>

<p>「I <em>told</em> you not to do anything unreasonable, so what was — Eh?」</p>

<p>Ahh. I see.</p>

<p>This old man… He’s sent out to repel any unhatched beginners, isn’t he? If that’s the case, I suppose it would be unexpected that Fran was the one who sent the other side flying.</p>

<p>「Eh? <em>Ehh?</em>」</p>

<p>It seems that Ms. Receptionist is quite surprised to see Donna seriously injured.</p>

<hr>
<p>(¹) It’s essentially “Oni/Ogre Person” — but I wasn’t sure whether I should just make it “Oni/Ogre” or not, seeing as there’ll likely be a Demonic Beast of that exact Race… So, onomatopoeia! If anyone has a better suggestion, feel free! 鬼人</p>

<p>(²) Both “Playback” and “Revival” have to due with coming back from the dead. 再生 and 起死回生</p>

<p>(³) The bracelet is 身代りの腕輪, which could also be “Sacrificial Bracelet” — so essentially another thing related to revival. It’d take his place if he died, essentially.</p>

<p>(⁴) Just TRY to translate ふざけんな without cussing while staying true to the writing. I dare you.</p>

<p>(⁵) No, this isn’t me praising my naming sense. It’s really there. 種族も鬼人とかいう、かっこいい種族だし。</p>

        <h1>Chapter 19: We Joined the Guild</h1>

<p>「<em>Ahahaha!</em> Wellー, I lost!」<br>
「Donna, this is no laughing matter.」</p>

<p>After the examination, Fran and I were brought by Donna Dorondo to the top floor of the Adventurer’s Guild.</p>

<p>Waiting for us was a thin, blond, fair-skinned man. If one looked at his ears, they would discover he was an Elf. At first glance he seems weak, but……</p>

<p>It was a man who exceeded Donna. Those Magic Skills are just too dangerous. Spirit Magic also seems to be quite rare. As expected of a Guild Master.</p>

<p>「First, let me hear your name.」<br>
「Fran.」<br>
「Age?」<br>
「12.」</p>

<p>Donna howled at the words of Fran.</p>

<p>「What? You really are as old as you look!」</p>

<p>Ahh, I suppose it would be like that. Looking at Fran’s abilities, it would be easy to think that she was actually a member of a long-lived race. Otherwise, it would be quite bizarre, given her appearance.</p>

<p>「Donna…」<br>
「<em>Ahー</em>, excuse me.」</p>

<p>Donna, who was rebuked by the Guild Master, shrugged his shoulders. Not cute at <em>all</em>. However, his manners are completely different than the one before the examination. At the time he the embodiment of Fun’nu (⁴), but now he has the feel of of a good-natured uncle.</p>

<p>「However… I understand how you feel. Only 12 years old, and yet capable of using Sword Techniques directly after firing off Lv10 Fire Magic — without a chant, even? Is that some kind of joke?」</p>

<p>The Guild Master furrows his brow. His eyes become sharp, as if peering deep into Fran.</p>

<p>「Moreover… You have a Appraisal blocking Skills?」</p>

<p>That reminds me, this person has Appraisal, doesn’t he? He likely tried to find out whether the story told by Fran was a lie using it. However, it was intercepted.</p>

<p>At times like these, my Self-Evolution Points were well-used. The nice thing about this Skill is that it effects Fran as well as me, unlike some Skills.</p>

<p>Appraisal Concealment  ：A Skill used to inhibit the use of Appraisal on the user. When equipped with this ability, Appraisal of the user’s equipment is also blocked.</p>

<p>However, because of this Skill doubt has surfaced.</p>

<p>「So, according to you, you’re 12. But where did you come from?」<br>
「Secret.」<br>
「…… Is there a reason for that?」<br>
「Secret.」<br>
「…… <em>Haa…</em> How troublesome.」</p>

<p>Weーll, I’ve become slightly anxious. He’s trying to probe Fran.</p>

<p>「Pass? Fail?」<br>
「I won’t turn away someone strong enough to take on Donna.」<br>
「Then, Guild Card.」<br>
「… I understand. I’ll prepare it now, so please fill in the necessary information on this form. If you cannot write, then perhaps I could do it on your behalf?」<br>
「Unconcerned.」</p>

<p>On top of Fran’s parents giving a good education, she was also taught how to read and write in order to increase her value as a Slave.</p>

<p>「Any skilled Adventurers are welcome! Right, Guild Masterー?」<br>
「<em>Haa</em>… That’s right. The Spirits aren’t being noisy either.」<br>
「Spirits?」<br>
「Even if you look around, only Spirit Users can see them.」<br>
「What do they tell you?」<br>
「Well, Spirits are sensitive to emotions. Therefore, depending on their behavior I’m able to determine those with malicious intent, and those with a wicked heart.」</p>

<p>Spirits sure are convenient. I’d also like to use them by all means. The problem is whether there’s a Demonic Beast that’s capable of using Spirit Magic.</p>

<p>「Is there a Demonic Beast that can use Spirit Magic?」<br>
「There’re Spirits which feed on the malice of others, but even so they rarely devour such things from Demonic Beasts. Regrettably.」</p>

<p>I see. That’s good news. That just means that there’re some worth looking for.</p>

<p>「Guild Master, we’re ready.」<br>
「I see. Then, let’s go.」</p>

<p>The Guild Master personally guides us to a small room adjacent to the front counter. There’s something like an alter within the room, and a crystal ball is enshrined there.</p>

<p>「Please touch this. It will finish immediately.」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>Just as the Guild Master said, it finishes in an instant. It seemed to register Fran’s Magical Power one way or another. Next to the crystal ball, the receptionist tinkers with the crystal ball. Pressing the card against it, the process seems to be completed.</p>

<p>「Now, to select a Job.」<br>
「Job?」<br>
「Yes. There’re various benefits depending on the Job itself, but each person has their own aptitudes.」</p>

<p>Speaking of Jobs, Randell had been a “Merchant”. Donna is a “Great Warrior” and the Guild Master is a “Greater Spirit User”.</p>

<p>「For Jobs, Fran can choose…… Eh?」<br>
「What’s wrong, Flannel?」(⁵)<br>
「Her Job aptitude is a bit… Strange.」<br>
「Hoh?」</p>

<p>I look at the screen from behind the Guild Master.</p>

<p>Warrior, Swordsman, Pugilist, Magic Swordsman, Blink Swordsman, Magician, Flame Magician, White Magician, Summoning Magician, Demonic Beast User, Spy, Doctor, Butcher (⁶), Cook</p>

<p>There’re a lot. Job aptitude seems to depend on the Skills that Fran has equipped. There’re also Spear Arts and Spear Techniques equipped, but it seems that there’s no Job for them. Even though there’re Jobs called Cook and Butcher…</p>

<p>「This is……」</p>

<p>Even the Guild Master is at a loss for words. Is this perhaps bad?</p>

<p>「Haa… Well, Magic Swordsman and Magician were to be expected after hearing of the battle with Donna.」</p>

<p>Ah, it seems to be alright. He’s probably getting used to being surprised.</p>

<p>「Then, what will you choose?」<br>
『Ask about his recommendation.』<br>
「Suggestion?」<br>
「Hmm. Because Magic Swordsman, Blink Swordsman, and Flame Magician are all intermediate Jobs, they’re quite rare. The benefits gained from them will also be quite strong. If you wish to use both the sword and Magic, I recommend the Magic Swordsman. If it’s just swords, then the Blink Swordsman. If you wish to focus on Magic, then perhaps the Flame Magician.」</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>I see. What to do……</p>

<p>『Which one would you like, Fran?』<br>
（Magic Swordsman: cool.）<br>
『Then, perhaps the Magic Swordsman?』</p>

<p>However, there’s still one piece of information needed before the final choice.</p>

<p>「Change Jobs?」<br>
「Yes. You may do so at the Guild at any time, however, only one Job’s effects can be set at a time. So, if a high leveled Magic Swordsman changed to a Lv1 Blink Swordsman, their status would fall.」</p>

<p>Well, I don’t mind because that’s what I expected. If it can be changed anyways, then perhaps Magic Swordsman would be alright for now?</p>

<p>「Then, Magic Swordsman.」<br>
「With this, the Guild Card has been completed.」</p>

<p>It looks like a regular bronze card. Fran’s name, place of registration (Aressa), Job, and the Adventurer Rank of G are all listed.</p>

<p>「The Guild Card can be used as an identification card, and having it re-issued will cost 5,000 Gorudo. Because it’s been registered via the Magic Power of the individual, it’s only usable by that person alone. Be careful not to lose it.」</p>

<p>Other points, such as other cautions and its application in the Guild were then explained by the Guild Master. Usually this would be work of a receptionist, but in this case the Guild Master took care of it all personally.</p>

<p>Collecting all of the information together, it can be summarized as the following:</p>

<p>Regarding Guild requests:<br>
An Adventurer can only take requests in accordance to their Adventurer Rank. Specifically, they’re only able to take requests one Rank above and below their own.</p>

<p>Under certain conditions, a Rank-up test can be requested.</p>

<p>For the color of the cards:<br>
G and F are Copper, E and D are Black, C and B are Silver, A is Gold, and S is Platinum. Purchasing the materials required for the card isn’t necessary.</p>

<p>There aren’t any annual membership fees, but there is the possibility of being demoted or expulsion if an Adventurer doesn’t take on a request for a certain period of time.</p>

<p>Betrayal against the Adventurer’s Guild will result in a complete purge of rank, so it’s best to be careful. In addition, it’s best to be careful of trouble between Adventurers, because the Guild takes no responsibility.</p>

<p>That last piece of information was likely advice specifically for Fran. Didn’t doing so just raise a flag, though?</p>

<p>「With this, you’ve become an Adventurer.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「Is there anything else you’d like to ask about?」</p>

<p>I’ve inquired about what I’d like to hear, but there’s still one thing left to ask.</p>

<p>「Examination content, published?」<br>
「No. Because it involves the ability of the Adventurer themselves, doing so would be reckless.」<br>
「Alright.」<br>
「Do you not wish to attract attention?」<br>
「Don’t want to.」<br>
「Then I’ll make you a promise. We three people: Donna, Flannel from reception, and I will not reveal information regarding the examination. Well, doing so would be convenient for us as well. Donna stands at the front of the Adventurers in case of emergencies, so it would be better to not reveal his loss.」<br>
「I’ll give my assent. If the little lady wants to keep it a secret, I understand.」<br>
「I think that, given your abilities, you’ll attract attention immediately regardless, but……」</p>

<p>Uーmu. I can’t refute that. Well, I guess it’s fine that it’s peaceful for now, at least?</p>

<hr>
<p>(¹) Easiest name to translate so far. It only has the option of being the name Klimt. クリムト</p>

<p>(²) A couple of notes regarding some of this guy’s Skills.<br>
First: I had previously translated 土魔術 as “Ground Magic”; now, however, it is<strong>“Soil Magic”</strong> — because 大地魔術 (which this guy has) is the <em>ACTUAL</em> Ground Magic. My best guess is that Ground is the LvMax Magic type gained through Soil Magic, like how Flame was to Fire. I’ve made the changes to C10 and C13 — but I can’t remember if it was mentioned elsewhere, so if it was, tell me!<br>
Second: Compounding is like the medicine compounding. It could also be “mixing” 調合</p>

<p>(³) Regarding the titles:<br>
“Guardian Deity” can’t just be “Guardian” because it’s 守護神 (literally Guardian Deity).<br>
Not sure why this guy has the Master of Nature title despite Nature Magic only being Lv6 but… <em>*shrug*</em> It’s there. 樹木術師<br>
For those who actually translate that on their own, it’ll be “Tree/shrub Technique User” — but all the “Master” titles are like that. I made that change because it fit with the fact that the Skill needed to be maxed out, but… Perhaps I need to reconsider now that this one’s arrived?</p>

<p>(⁴) This might just be a reference to a noise or something. “He was all *Fuuーnuuu!* for example. But I have no clue. When I did a search, it brought me Duel-Master pages and <a href="http://gathe.ocnk.net/data/gathe/product/43054.jpg">this image</a>, so this is just my best guess.<br>
The image is fitting, after all. フンヌー</p>

<p>(⁵) Receptionist’s name = Flannel (ネル) apparently. -kun was also used, so I’m unsure of their gender at this point. In the previous chapter I had used “Ms. Receptionist” at the end, but it turns out that was just my machines being sexist. (受付嬢 = Receptionist or Reception Woman)<br>
Because it’s possible that the Guild Master simply uses -kun because Flannel is likely way, way younger than him, and not directly equivalent to any sexual orientation. Not that that matters, <em>right</em>?</p>

<p>(⁶) “Butcher” is related to the Deconstruction Skill, but “Deconstructor” just doesn’t sound right as a Job among the other ones, and “Demolitionist” brings the image of someone standing a couple hundred feet away and blowing stuff up, so… Yeah. Butcher <em>was</em> listed as an applicable translation, so I went with it.</p>

<p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p>If you haven’t read about the status of the other works  yet, then please do so. Well, if you read other things here, that is. Seeing as I finished this chapter, you can ignore the info on Sword-shisho though.</p>

<p>This was asked by the Flannel the receptionist. I was reminded by those words; after getting the Guild Card, there was so much to do that I forgot about it. And “it” was that we won’t be able to stay at an inn if we don’t sell our materials to the Guild.</p>

<p>「I have Goblin horns.」<br>
「Ahh, in that case, I’ll accept them at the request report counter. This way, please.」</p>

<p>Because Fran’s new as an Adventurer, Flannel politely leads the way after his response. As one would accept from a receptionist of the Adventurers Guild. They’re very thorough in educating their members.</p>

<p>「Also materials.」<br>
「Ah, you can sell those at the material purchase counter. First, however, comes the payment for the Goblin Horns.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「8 sets, so that’ll be 160 Gorudo total. Please confirm it.」</p>

<p>The amount needed to book a room at an inn hasn’t been reached yet. The worst inn was supposedly 200 Gorudo, so we’ll need just a bit more if we want to stay overnight.</p>

<p>We move over to the material purchasing counter after the transaction is verified.</p>

<p>「Has the material’s already been dismantled? If not it usually takes up a lot of space, so it can be brought to the space beside the counter. If it’s too large for that as well, we’ll use a special room instead.」</p>

<p>Flannel carefully explains. So, what should we do… Lower ranked Demonic Beasts are cheap, judging by the advice we were given in regards to the Goblins and Insects earlier. So, I suppose the minimum we should give should be intermediate or above? I have a couple of slightly larger ones, so perhaps those?</p>

<p>「Slightly big.」<br>
「Then, I would like for it to be placed in the purchasing space. Are they currently stored at an inn? Materials should be managed carefully if they’re expensive, so –」</p>

<p>Ahh, at first glance we don’t look like we’ve brought anything, so I suppose his question is natural. However, when I was Appraising people earlier, I found many individuals with the Dimensional Storage Skill, so it shouldn’t be unheard of. It should be fine if I take it out here and now because of that.</p>

<p>「Taking out.」</p>

<p>Of course, the materials are actually being taken out by me. This is one of the slight drawbacks of this Skill and Skill Sharing. Fran can use the Dimensional Storage Skill as well, but the storage is exclusive to Fran. Similarly, I can’t share the contents of my storage with Fran, so she obviously can’t retrieve anything I’ve stored.</p>

<p>Fran assumes a stance that makes it seem as though she takes out the materials, and I place the materials where she directs.</p>

<p>At first, I take out beginner-class materials exclusively.</p>

<p>Among them is Fran’s commemorative first prey, the Twin-Headed Bear’s fur and claws. Because its innards can be used to make good medicine, they remain within the storage. I also leave them because it would make a disturbing scene if they were brought out. I bring out two sets of Poison Fang Rat pelts and fangs, and figure it would be best to stop there for now.</p>

<p>「When did you…?」<br>
「While coming to town.」<br>
「Did you also dismantle these yourself?」<br>
「Yes.」</p>

<p>Some curious Adventurers became a little noisy in the surrounding area. <em>Oi</em>, don’t laugh after glancing over here. Hmm… Could it be that the materials are worth even less than expected?</p>

<p>Then… Next I’ll place one a bit better.</p>

<p>From Area 2 in the Plains, I take materials from 3 Demonic Beasts.</p>

<p>First are the sinister-looking wing membranes and resonating bones (¹) of Giant Bats. Next are the fangs, fur, and skulls of Crashing Boars. Finally, I take out the shells and horns of Rock Bison.</p>

<p>Although they aren’t strong Monsters (²), they should be enough to buy a few days worth of lodging at an inn, alongside cheap protective gear.</p>

        </div>
        

<p>We could gain even more if I took out the materials from the Tyrant Saber or the Doppel Snake… But I refrained. Not only would doing so attract too much attention, but the materials might be able to be used to make Fran weapons as well.</p>

<p>The Guild Master’s scale clothing makes use of something similar to the scales of the Doppel Snake, and the cloak used by Donna made use of a Demonic Beast’s fur similar to that of the Tyrant Saber. In other words, those materials would be ones which only high-ranking adventurers would be able to use in their equipment. It would definitely make a commotion if we sold such materials here.</p>

<p>Flannel is making a slightly difficult face. As expected, it would be difficult to comprehend the fact that the young-aged Fran could take down strong Demonic Beasts — Demonic Beasts that even an adult male would have trouble defeating.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the materials from low-grade Demonic Beasts wouldn’t grant much income, so this is for the sake of getting funds. Even if it’s a bit conspicuous, it would be better to finish it all at once.</p>

<p>That being the case, perhaps it would be better to sell off all of the lower and intermediate ranked Demonic beasts here and now…?</p>

<p>『Hey, what do you think?』<br>
（One time is better.）<br>
『Indeed! Then, I’ll take out the rest!』</p>

<p>I take out pouch-fulls of thread from Stone Spiders, as well as their carapaces and poisonous fangs. Next, I take out Burrowing Moles claws and fur, followed by the pelts and claws of the Paralysis Nailed Cat are then placed into the purchasing space.</p>

<p>Because I can use most of the meats to make meals for Fran, I leave them within the storage.</p>

<p>「All this.」<br>
「…… Y-Yes. I see. I’ll now use Appraisal, so please wait a moment.」</p>

<p>Flannel uses Appraisal on each of the materials. That skill is incredibly versatile. Other receptionists are also called over, so in the end three people check over the materials.</p>

<p>Everything had gone through Appraisal after about 10 minutes.</p>

<p>「Sorry to have kept you waiting.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「Altogether, we’ll purchase them all for 195,000 Gorudo total. Is that acceptable?」(³)</p>

<p>Ha? 195,000?! Seriously?! Isn’t that way too high? I had thought that ~30,000 would have been satisfactory…</p>

<p>「Very high?」<br>
「No, that’s a reasonable price. Even though they’re materials from Demonic Beasts with Threat Degrees of F an E, due to the fact that the state of the materials was extremely good, the price was increased.」</p>

<p>I didn’t think of the material’s state. But… Thinking about it, that would be correct. It would be outrageous to think that the price of a pelt covered with scratches would have the same price as a beautifully preserved one.</p>

<p>「For example: usually, the fur of a Twin-Headed Bear is purchased for 6,000 Gorudo. The fur you’ve brought, however, doesn’t have any scratches. The Deconstruction is perfect, and on top of that, the whole body was prepared. Because of that, its price was raised to 18,000 Gorudo.」</p>

<p>It tripled. Unbelievable… Since the other materials are also in such a state, the price would be reasonable… Right? Well, I’ll accept it regardless.</p>

<p>「This is the reward. Please confirm it.」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>Fran tucks the money away in Dimensional Storage immediately.</p>

<p>「Then.」</p>

<p>With that, Fran turned her back to the counter.</p>

<p>「<strong><em>Goraa!</em></strong> Wait just a second!」</p>

<hr>
<p>(¹) It’s 共鳴骨. I’m not sure what “resonating bones” are — but it could also be “sympathy/sympathetic”. Those’re the only two options, so I went with “resonating” because it might related to the Bats’ echolocation.</p>

<p>(²) The Author used 魔物 (Monster) here as opposed to 魔獣 (Demonic Beast).<em>*gasp*</em></p>

<p>(³) There’s no mistake, because it’s in legitimate numbers (195000) in the raw.</p>

<p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p><code>Ensig:</code><br>
The Flag.<br>
<strong><em>It really </em>was<em> raised, huh?</em></strong></p>

    < /br>

        <p>「<em><strong>Goraa!</strong></em> Wait just a second!」</p>

<p>After receiving payment for the materials, we’ve been stopped by a single Adventurer right before leaving the Guild.</p>

<p>「Nn.」<br>
「<em>Hey</em>, wait brat!」</p>

<p>Fran, who ignored the man, attempts to pass by through moving to the side. Because he blocked the way in such a flashy manner, he likely wasn’t expecting to be completely ignored. Hurriedly, he moves to block Fran’s route.</p>

<p>But Fran continues walking.</p>

<p>「Nn.」<br>
「Didn’t I say to wait?! Hey, are you listening?!」<br>
「In the way.」<br>
「Listen up and stop!」</p>

<p>Incredible. We really did experience such a refreshing template development. (¹) I’m slightly interested in this mob-like Adventurer.</p>

<p>『Fran, let’s listen to him a little.』<br>
「Nn? Understood.」<br>
「It’s fine if you understand.」</p>

<p>Looking at the man’s appearance, he’s a mob character no matter how you look at it. He has slightly-damaged Iron Shoulder Pads with spikes facing outward, the spikes seem to have design as a priority. For armor he’s wearing pitch black Leather Armor with a smell I’d like to avoid experiencing no matter what, and a Battleaxe strapped to his back. Finally, he has a bald head that could only be seen by people cosplaying as a Bandit.</p>

<p>Ahhー, my reincarnation is worthwhile meeting this classic Fantasy element: The King・of・Mob character.</p>

<p>If his cheeks had scratches, he’d be perfect… Truly regrettable!</p>

<p>Moreover, 4 similar fellows came out in a stream behind him. It’s a mob character festival! Woohoo~!</p>

<p>「Hey!」<br>
「What?」</p>

<p>Mr. Mob raises his voice, and turns towards the astonished Flannel.</p>

<p>「This is favoritism!」<br>
「<em>Ha?</em> Favoritism?」<br>
「Yeah! When I sold the pelt of a Twin-Headed Bear earlier, it wasn’t bought for even 2,000 Gorudo!」</p>

<p>Listening to those words, Flannel makes a deep sigh.</p>

<p>「<em>Ahh</em>, I remember. You’re the party who brought the corpse of a Twin-Headed Bear that had scarring all over, one of its heads missing, and a badly bruised body, then demanded it be dismantled and sold, right?」<br>
「That’s right! We gave the same thing: a Twin-Headed Bear, so shouldn’t we have gotten the same amount of cash?!」<br>
「It’s not the same at all. The materials that you brought in all had the lowest ratings possible.」<br>
「<em>Haa?</em> Rating?」<br>
「Good grief, this is why I hate muscle-brained mercenaries like you… Because your fighting power is alright, you act all high and mighty despite being a beginner. You don’t understand even a fragment of what it means to be an Adventurer. Just drop dead.」</p>

<p>W-Woah. Flannel had said it in a low voice, but I heard it. If possible, let’s try not to oppose Flannel from now on.</p>

<p>「Your group had surrounded the Twin-Headed Bear, and recklessly stabbed it from all sides, correct?」<br>
「Yeah. We lured it in with bait, and then all 5 of us attacked it. Because it had a Threat Level of F, it was advised for beginners to take care, but it was an easy win! Saying that it would be a hard fight, I guess other Adventurers are just cowards!」</p>

<p>Ahー. I get it.</p>

<p>He likely confused the reason for that difficulty rating. There’s a difference between “difficult to defeat” and “difficult to defeat cleanly”. The simplistic Mr. Mob and his buddies probably thought that so long as it was defeated they could cash in regardless of the corpse’s state.</p>

<p>They made too lightly of the cheat Skill known as Dismantling! Skinning it neatly, and polishing every material is difficult! It’s hard labor! Even Fran and I only managed to dismantle these materials through considerable hardships. We thought we would be hated if we brought them in without dismantling them first, after all.</p>

<p>「Is that so?<br>
The Fur was completely worn out, and wouldn’t be usable for decorations. If it was used for equipment, the product would no doubt be lower grade.<br>
The heads are usually processed and stuffed as trophies, but one was missing and the remaining one was badly damaged.<br>
The nails were missing as well, giving it the minimum value.<br>
Organs that could be used for medicine were wounded too badly to be usable, and the meat had already spoiled by the time it was brought in, so it couldn’t even be used for food.<br>
In other words, the Twin-Headed Bear you brought in was almost as good as<em>garbage</em>. You brought a <em>bulky piece of rubbish</em> in, so wouldn’t it be impossible for us to make any money off of it?<br>
<em>Ahh</em>, also, because it wasn’t dismantled, I had to dismantle it myself didn’t I? The dismantling rate for disposing of things like the rotten internal organs should have been taken into consideration when it was assessed. The total should have been 1,600 Gorudo, right? In retrospect, even that was too much.」</p>

<p>The man can’t interrupt Flannel as he continues to talk about his evaluation. Stunned, all he could do is listen to Flannel talking like a machine gun in utter amazement.</p>

<p>I would too if he was directing those words at me. However, it seems that he still couldn’t understand. No, he wasn’t capable of understanding. He seems to be the type who refuses to back down.</p>

<p>「So noisy, stop nagging already! (²) Talking about things that seem suitable in order to make a smokescreen, don’t fuck with me! The amount you gave us was unfair, so cough the rest up right now!」<br>
「<em>That’s right! That’s right!</em>」(³)</p>

<p>I was amused at first but… This is just pitiful. He’s the type that believes that his reasons are absolute, and refuses to listen to others. He’ll make noise until his opinion is accepted.</p>

<p>It’s becoming more irritating by the second.</p>

<p>「It isn’t unfair.」<br>
「It <em>is</em> unfair! It was decided unfairly!」<br>
「<em>Haa…</em> Instead of complaining, why not improve your ability to hunt? Unlike Mercenaries which just cut down their enemies, being an adventurer is difficult in a lot of ways. Although, judging by your appearance, it seems impossible for you to become a proper Adventurer.」<br>
「<em>Haa?!</em> You talk so highly about Adventurers, but on the battlefield they’d be seen as nothing but cowards! If we took ’em on, they wouldn’t stand a chance!」</p>

<p>We’re likely not the only ones feeling offended by this guy. The eyes of the neighboring Adventurers seem to certify that suspicion. To make a fool out of Adventurers here…</p>

<p>Furthermore, he directed such words towards the beautiful receptionist Flannel, who is no doubt popular. (⁴) Because he picked a fight with Flannel as well as Adventurers in general, it’s natural that the anger in the surrounding is building up.</p>

<p>These guys… Do they have some kind of death wish? Their status is inferior to the other Adventurers in the lobby.</p>

<p>He’s a small fry. This is the status of the strongest of them. It it was me, I could beat him in less than 5 seconds.</p>

<p>While being troubled over what to do, the supposed leader of the group turns this way. I suppose he thought that arguing to Flannel would be useless; that’s what I can read from his foolish appearance, at least.</p>

<p>「Besides, how the hell could a brat like this bring in such a large amount of Demonic Beasts?!」<br>
「What?」<br>
「The exchange must have been fixed!」<br>
「And so? What could that have to do with this? Suddenly claiming that this girl got the materials through illegal means has nothing to do with you, right?」<br>
「…… It is! It <em>is</em> related! Because that money should have been ours to begin with, we have the right to take it back!」</p>

<p><em>Uwaーa</em>. There’s no longer any sense remaining in this guy’s argument. What kind of thought process led him to that conclusion? Kichi〇i is over hereー! (⁷)</p>

<p>「She gathered those materials with her own hands. Her abilities are enough to kill a Twin-Headed Bear and beautifully dismantle it at minimum.」<br>
「Hah! You really think so?! <em>Hey</em>, you’re a member of the Black Cat tribe, right?」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「The Black Cat tribe are particularly famous for their people being <em>complete weaklings</em>. For a member of that tribe to kill a Demonic Beast like that one is impossible! As expected, there’s definitely something more to it!」<br>
「<em>Yeah! Yeah!</em>」<br>
「Damn brat. I’ll overlook your crime this time if you pay some consolation money. Take out the money you received a minute ago.」<br>
「<em>Hehehe…</em> The Guild doesn’t stick their neck into a fight between Adventurers, so you won’t be intervening, right?」<br>
「<em>Tch</em>……」</p>

<p>To their behavior, Flannel becomes stiff. What they said was correct. The Guild doesn’t interfere with the quarrels of the Adventurers. In other words… Whatever happens, the Adventurer’s Guild will turn a blind eye. Even if that quarrel becomes a crime. That should be natural.</p>

<p>If these guys are really thinking that, then something must be wrong with their heads. It’s not even at the level of a fool anymore. Could it be that inside of their heads, there’s a Slime trapped inside?</p>

        </div>
        

<p>「<em>Hey</em>, what’s with that look?」<br>
「……」</p>

<p>Fran looks up at the man. Her face is expressionless as always. But a clear anger is evident within her eyes.</p>

<p>「<em>Ah?</em> Does a weak member of the Black Cat tribe intend to go against someone from the Red Dog tribe?」<br>
「<em>Yeah, yeah!</em> Damn cat, don’t get carried away!」<br>
「You put us Beastmen to shame! But hey, I just might forgive you if you hand over the money, you know?」</p>

<p>To call her the lowest of the low, is that what you intend to say? If Fran wasn’t angrier than I was, I would have cut them down long ago.</p>

<p><strong><em>*Buti*</em></strong></p>

<p>The sound of one running out of patience. I surely heard such a thing.</p>

<p>Fran’s goal is to raise the position of the Black Cat tribe, to succeed the will of her deceased parents. With these guys’ abuse, she probably can’t endure any longer.</p>

<p>「Shut up.」<br>
「What?」<br>
「Your barking is noisy, <em>dog</em>.」 (⁸)</p>

<p>She said it! You said it, Fran! You did well! I’ll treat you to something delicious later!</p>

<p>「You bastard! I’ll kill you!」</p>

<p>I’m tired of hearing template-like lines already.</p>

<p>「Impossible, weakling.」<br>
「<em>Ah?</em> Did you just call me a weakling?」<br>
「Even though you’re just a weakling of the Black Cat tribe!」<br>
「Disappear in 5 seconds, or bark 1,000 times. I’ll overlook you, <em>dog</em>.」<br>
「<em>You–!</em> After I have my way with you, I’ll sell you off to the Slave Traders! No more mercy!」(⁹)</p>

<p>Extortion, assaulting a little girl, and human trafficking. These guys are finished. If the police were around, they’d immediately be arrested. There’re already some Adventurers walking out of the Guild.</p>

<p>Well, shall we put an end to this?</p>

<p>「Bad breath. Stop talking.」<br>
「Fucking brat!」</p>

<p>He put his hands on his weapon! Yes, justifiable defense has been established!</p>

<p>「Die, brat!」</p>

<p>Out of the question. You can’t even move anymore, after all.</p>

<p>「Ah? I-Iaa, <strong>AHHHhhhhhhhh!</strong> My foot is–! <em><strong>Hiiaaaa!</strong></em>」</p>

<p>The man’s body, losing its support, falls to the side. Both of his legs have been severed from the knee.</p>

<p>Fran didn’t pull me out, either. She had used the Lv6 Sword Technique: Aura・Blade. It’s a technique which develops a blade made purely out of magic power, just for an instant. Its power is low, but it can be combined with Vibrating Fang, and depending on the user’s MGC, it can become invisible. It could be seen as an ideal technique for assassination.</p>

<p>And she’s already learnt how to use it! Fran, my frightening girl!</p>

<p>The man squirms about like a caterpillar in the pool of blood which continues to grow from his legs’ wounds.</p>

<p>「<em>AH<strong>ii</strong>II</em>, <strong><em>Ahiiiiiiii</em></strong>」</p>

<p>Disgusting! Absolutely revolting.</p>

<p>「Y-you…… B-B-But, <em>Aahh?</em>」<br>
「<em>!!…!… <strong>I-It hur–!</strong></em>」</p>

<p>Two more people fall to the ground due to Vibration Bullets fired by Fran breaking and tossing their legs aside. In addition, as a follow-up attack, more Vibration Bullets are fired at their faces. Their power is held back, but their noses are destroyed and their frontal teeth are completely lost. Their eyes might be done for as well.</p>

<p>The two remaining can’t understand the situation. For the time being, they back away from Fran, so they likely understand that she’s dangerous at this point at least. However, it’s not like Fran’s disdain has disappeared. <em>They should have run away.</em></p>

<p>『Slow judgement is fatal.』</p>

<p>Cleanup would have been troublesome, but Fran would have been fully capable of killing them if she intended to.</p>

<p>Fran kicks the floor, and in the next moment, she’s right before one of them them. And with me, who’s still covered in cloth, she strikes their face with all her might.</p>

<p><strong><em>*Gan! Gan!*</em></strong></p>

<p>More or less, it was equivalent to striking with the back of one’s sword. No, because they were hit with the abdomen of the sword, perhaps it would qualify as an abdomen strike? (¹⁰) Well, regardless, their legs and faces now have comminuted fractures. (¹¹) Most likely, low-leveled potions won’t be able to heal them completely.</p>

<p>Turning around, the first technique from Pugilism: Aura・Kick is used against the last one remaining. With vibration applied, of course. He was abut to draw his weapon, but it was too late. His knee was broken, and the muscles inside were shredded. To finish with, he’s struck in the face with a vibrating elbow strike.</p>

<p>End scene. Noise from the surrounding Adventurers has disappeared entirely, and only the screams for help from the other men resounded in the Guild.</p>

<p>「Hey?」<br>
「Y-Yes!」<br>
「May I go?」<br>
「<em>Ah</em>…… Yeah. Thank you very much. We hope to see you again.」</p>

<p>Ohh, Flannel has a good smile. How refreshing. Secretly, I make a mental thumbs up for “Good Job”.</p>

<p>「Well, as for <em>you guys</em>, I’ll hand you over to the soldiers.」<br>
「<em>Ahh– Ahh</em>, you don’t plan on catching that damn brat?! W-We were suddenly attacked, so–!」<br>
「<strong><em>Haa?</em></strong> What nonsense are you saying? Damn scum, all that child did was act in self-defense, isn’t that right?」<br>
「R-right. <em>That’s right!</em> That’s how it is!」<br>
「It was completely self-defense!」</p>

<p>Hooray~ I can be at ease if Flannel and the other Adventurers have to give testimony.</p>

<p>「It hurー! <strong>It hurts!</strong> Please, heal me!」<br>
「<em>Ahh</em>, before that, I need to receive the bill for the floor you defiled. Blood is hard to remove, you know? You suffered a great loss, so I’ll leave it at <em>10,000 Gorudo</em>. If you pay it, I might just heal you.」</p>

<p>You didn’t say that you’d heal them for sure! Flannel!</p>

<p>After listening to Flannel’s remarks, we leave the guild.</p>

<p>A considerable amount of time was taken up. The sun is already starting to set.</p>

<p>『Shall we look for an inn for the time being? Since we’re in town, I’d hate to camp out.』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<hr>
<p>(¹) For those who don’t know, “Template” is essentially equivalent to cliché — it’s just that it’s a bit slang-ish.</p>

<p>(²) It was  in the flesh. Better strike that off the bingo card.<br>
I may or may not have spent over an hour watching Vocaloid music and ending up at  when I linked that.</p>

<p>(³) This is from the follower-mobs, just so that’s clear.</p>

<p>(⁴) “Beautiful Person (F)” (美人) is used here. Flannel is confirmed to be a girl — and a beautiful one at that. Add another template to the list, m8’s.</p>

<p>(⁵) ダムン. The first two characters could actually be “dumb”. Well played, Author.</p>

<p>(⁶) Changed Fran’s Race to “Black Cat Beastman” because adding Beastman in is actually more accurate. The exact translation would be “Beastman・{Type} Tribe”, but instead of adding in “Tribe” I’ll just have it as a bit of invisible logic. For example: You can understand that Black Cat Beastmen in general are being talked about if I say “Black Cat Tribe”, right?</p>

<p>(⁷) Another unknown reference. I have no clue. I suppose it’s some sort of insane character? Or perhaps a nonsensical one? キチ〇イ</p>

<p>(⁸) 犬 is “Dog” — but it can also be the derogatory “loser/asshole”. Just know that as the conversation progresses.</p>

<p>(⁹) He uses 犯し which is, so we’re clear, essentially “rape”. When “assault” is used in the line above, it can also be rape. I’m going to enjoy translating this trash being kicked around.<br>
After translating, I can confirm: I did indeed enjoy translating that.</p>

<p>(¹⁰) I think this was a joke, but translation killed it. It’s essentially a reflection on how, as a “broadsword” type of sword, rather than a “back” he used his “abdomen” (side) to strike a non-lethal blow.</p>

<p>(¹¹) The type of fracture one would get from car crashes. It’s 粉砕骨折 — so “comminuted fracture” is the only translation.</p>

<p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p>You may have noticed, but I used <em>italics</em> a lot in this chapter. It’s not because I’m in love with them or anything, it’s just because the bandi– I mean Mob guys use “ー” a lot.</p>

<p>Just so you’re aware, “ー” isn’t a dash (-) — it’s a sort of Japanese character used for elongating vowels. For example: Uwaaaaa =  Uwaーa. Screams and such are excluded, but they can be used in compleーteley regular sentances, you knoーw? It just loーks awkward if they’re uーsed a lot. Riーght?</p>

<p>Thus, italics.</p>

<p>Anyways, time to sleep~</p>

<p>If there’re any mistakes, make sure to comment ’em, ’cause it’s 3:12 AM currently, and I have neither the desire nor consciousness remaining to edit ’em all out!</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <p>My name is Flannel. I work as a receptionist for the Adventurer’s Guild in the town of Aressa.</p>

<p>Today, I was quite astonished.</p>

<p>I’ll start at the beginning, when a young girl whose appearance wasn’t clean by any means came to the reception desk at the Guild.</p>

<p>Unintentionally, I had asked a question.</p>

<p>「Ah, yes. Are you alone?<br>
「Alone.」<br>
「Erm… This is the Adventurer’s Guild, so…」<br>
「I know.」</p>

<p>It seemed as though she really intended to become an Adventurer. She even seemed to carry a sword on her back……</p>

<p>If one thinks of making money, Adventurers are one of the things that naturally come to mind. And so, I thought that this girl was aiming to get rich, much like many others. But a lot of such people die. Especially for children, it can be said that most people who become Adventurers don’t survive.</p>

<p>And so, I informed the Guild Master of the young girl. Sure enough, Donna Dorondo was to take charge of the exam.</p>

<p>The Adventurer’s Guild doesn’t have any particular conditions for recruiting, as to attain a wider range of talented people. However, the Guild Master of Aressa secretly imposes a limit. That limit is to protect those younger than 15 years old by inhibiting their registration. Of course, it’s not explicitly stated.</p>

<p>When a child comes to register, Donna Dorondo is put in charge of the exam, thus forcing the participant to fail. At first, he’d give verbal threats as a show of force, and then makes them submit by force if they don’t give up at that point.</p>

<p>Without exception, children could not win against Donna Dorondo. So, it could be said that the chances of success for Donna Dorondo’s exam was “0%”.</p>

<p>Even though it leaves a bad taste in the mouth, it’s for the sake of the child. Children have usually no training to be qualified as an Adventurer, and so they’re bound to die almost immediately. If one did survive, then they would be lucky just to scrape by financially. There’s no way that they’d be able to make a lot of money, after all.</p>

<p>They aren’t just sent away afterwards, however. When the child fails, I can enroll them in the Beginner Training conducted by the Guild without a participation fee. If they accept and complete the training, they can take the exam once again.</p>

<p>That day, however… There was an exception. I didn’t watch over the test, so when I rushed to the training grounds in response to a large noise, finding the girl standing unhurt, and the figure of Donna Dorondo sunk into the wall vomiting blood… I was surprised to say the least.</p>

<p>But the surprises happened one after another afterwards.</p>

<p>First would be the number of possible Jobs. Where there was usually only 2, maybe 3 to choose from, the girl had 15. Furthermore, they included intermediate Jobs like the Magic Swordsman, Flame Magician, and Blink Swordsman. At the time, I couldn’t even let out my voice……</p>

<p>After making the Guild Card, the girl– Fran was her name — wanted to sell some materials. Because they didn’t seem to be carrying anything, I had thought that they stored the materials in an Inn……</p>

<p>But instead, they took the materials out of nowhere.</p>

<p>Talking about storage, Item Box comes to mind, but that wasn’t the case in that situation. The materials were taken out of the hole which appeared out of thin air. It was a Technique from a super rare attribute: the Spatial-Temporal attribute. I’ve worked at the Guild for a long time, and among the people I’ve seen capable of using Spatial-Temporal attributes this girl was the 3rd.</p>

<p>The next surprise was when the fur of a Twin-Headed Bear was taken out. Its threat level was only F, so it wasn’t a very strong Demonic Beast — but I had never seen one in a state like that one.</p>

<p>The fur didn’t have a single cut, and had absolutely no blood stains. The dismantling was perfect, and the two heads remained close to one another. Moreover, it was a large individual, so its fur weighed in at about 1.3 times the normal amount.</p>

<p>Aristocrats would want this material without a doubt. It could be made into a coat, or even a carpet… Otherwise, it could be used as a material for a piece of high-quality equipment.</p>

<p>The cleanly dismantled Poison Fang Rat pelts could also be used for a wide range of applications. Its materials can be used to make poison-resistant gear, so despite being a lower ranked Demonic Beast, its value is high.</p>

<p>To that 12-year-old girl who brought out perfectly dismantled materials, the surrounding Adventurers could only raise voices of surprise. Some looked back at their own dismantled furs and give a dry laugh.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>But that wasn’t all. What she did next stole their voices entirely, rendering the Guild quiet.</p>

<p>She took out materials from the Giant Bat, then the Crashing Boar, then the Rock Bison, the Stone Spider. the Burrowing Mole, and finally she stopped at the Paralysis Nailed Cat. F and E threat level Demonic Beasts came out one after another.</p>

<p>A Demonic Beast of threat level E is said to be capable of leveling a village. It’s equivalent to an average Adventurer at rank D if it’s one-on-one. In other words, those who hunt them would have to be people who have ascended the ranks of beginner adventurers, or a party of said “beginners”.</p>

<p>And this girl hunted them alone? Moreover, she dismantled them perfectly? For dismantling of that caliper, a Dismantling Skill level 5 or 6 would be necessary at least… But having a Skill of such a high level at only 12 years old was abnormal.</p>

<p>By any chance… Did she have a form of blessing? But even with that, I thought that she was a little too strong…… The results of the mock battle with Donna Dorondo weren’t a lie, it seemed.</p>

<p>But what was the true identity of the Adventurer who asked that her personal information remained a secret? There’re many people who have done the same, but…</p>

<p>I strongly endured it, and assessed the materials properly. It was the most materials brought in by any copper ranked Adventurer recently. (¹) Naturally, it was a record high for the amount of materials brought in by a G rank.</p>

<p>If it had ended there, I would have finished while thinking 「A Promising Rookie has arrived.」</p>

<p>Instead, a certain situation developed. It was one that I expected, but it happened earlier than I thought it would.</p>

<p>Who would have thought that fools would cause a fuss within the Guild’s walls? Doing so would allow me to take away their Guild Cards. At worst, they could have even been turned into crime slaves.</p>

<p>Thinking back, they were a rookie party that regularly caused turmoil at the time. The leader was a Mercenary who crossed over and became an Adventurer because he didn’t make enough to eat.</p>

<p>But seriously, a useless Mercenary has no place picking a fight with an Adventurer! Unlike Adventurers who require a great deal of talent, Mercenaries abilities only include battling and decreasing the size of their brains.</p>

<p>There’s no end to these guys who convert to Adventurers thinking that it’ll be easy simply because they have some war experience. Such people have high pride, and low ability. I wouldn’t mind if they were more skillful, but…</p>

<p>Well, anyways. This group of idiots was of that category. They were primitive people who carried in a Demonic Beast that they hunted because they lacked the Dismantling Skill.</p>

<p>They also misunderstood the Guild’s rule not to get involved in fights between fellow Adventurers. The rule means that we’ll overlook mere squabbles. If we overlooked criminals, however, the Guild would be dissolved by the country. I’m really tired of idiots like them who can’t understand that much.</p>

<p>And so, while the group of idiots continued to add groundless arguments to their foolish reasoning, Fran snapped. Because she was the expressionless type, I didn’t recognize her at all.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a quiet child becoming angry is amazing. I’ll make sure to avoid angering Fran. I vowed so in my heart. At the end, I was called out to. Inevitably, it gave me a bit of a start.</p>

<p>The Adventurers who had spectated the event were also stunned. Without a doubt, they came to the understanding that she was stronger than them.</p>

<p>Even though she had stained the ground with the blood of fools, I didn’t particularly mind. Rather, I thought that she did well.</p>

<p>Screaming to be healed, were they idiots? Ah, right, they were.</p>

<p>They likely carried other crimes, so the death penalty was almost certain. At minimum, they would become Mining Slaves. They had threatened with illegal trafficking and attempted extortion, after all. In this Kingdom, such things are categorized as capital offenses.</p>

<p>While watching Fran leave the Guild, I had a simple thought.</p>

<p>「Before they’re delivered, could you extort the consolation money?」</p>

        <h1>Chapter 23: Old man Gallus</h1>

<p>『I didn’t think we’d be refused.』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
『”Even if you have a Guild Card, we don’t give shelter to children?”』</p>

<p>When we had arrived at an inn, that’s what the proprietress had said……</p>

<p>Clearly, she was paying attention to Fran’s appearance. Fran’s wearing tattered clothing and sandals, so she must have thought that Fran was either poor or a runaway slave. She doesn’t smell bad, however.</p>

<p>I can clean us using Purification Magic, so we’re completely sanitary.</p>

<p>『I suppose we should fix your appearance by buying Equipment first, then.』<br>
「 ? 」</p>

<p>But I don’t know where we can. Well, because I’ll be choosing the equipment just leave it to me!</p>

<p>We head towards the town’s plaza, located near the Adventurer’s Guild. Around here, there’re shops with Adventurers lining up in large numbers.</p>

<p>There’re lots of shops and stalls, so there’re enough Adventurers to match. There’re smithies for Weapons and Armor, Tailors, Apothecaries, Accessory Makers, Taverns, Restaurants, etc. There’s Really quite the variety.</p>

<p>This is also a good place to study the prices of things.</p>

<p>An Iron Knife is 2,000 Gorudo, a Grade 5 Life Potion is 10,000 Gorudo, a Grade 4 Antidote Potion is 20,000 Gorudo.</p>

<p>Grade 5 seems to be the lowest rank, but the price is quite reasonable. Even deep wounds seem to be cured in an instant, after all. If there was a medicine with the same effect in Japan its price would be far higher, which is why I think that the price is alright.</p>

<p>Such products are lined up next to one another, so I’m getting strangely excited.</p>

<p>『How interestingー』<br>
「Un.」<br>
『Oh! Fran thinks so as well?』<br>
「Lots of rare things. Amazing.」<br>
『I see, I see.』</p>

<p>Looking at Fran’s eyes, they’re shining bright. Her expressions don’t change much, but it’s good that Fran’s also enjoying this.</p>

<p>Now then, where’s the shop we’re looking for? As a matter of fact, while we were browsing I had heard an encouraging bit of information.</p>

<p>That is, about a famous Blacksmith who was staying in Aressa. They seem to have rented a store to open their smithy, too.</p>

<p>I want that Blacksmith to make Fran some armor. It might be impossible given our current funds, but we may as well ask.</p>

<p>『Well, I wonder where it is.』</p>

<p>Looking around, there’re many smithies and Armor shops, but none of them seem all that great. If it was a shop with an amazing Blacksmith, I figured there would be a large crowd, but I suppose not.</p>

<p>『Perhaps they’ve already closed for the day?』</p>

<p>It could be so if their goods were popular enough.</p>

<p>「You there, young lady. Like what you see?」<br>
「Un?」<br>
「Yes, yes, you my lady.」</p>

<p>Good heavens, did someone make a pass?! I put my guard up, but the voice belonged to an old Dwarf. It’s possible that he’s just an Erojiji (¹) using the disguise of a wrinkly old hermit, however, so it’s not safe yet.</p>

<p>If he plans to do anything strange, I’ll pretend to fall and pierce his foot to scare him off.</p>

<p>「You seem to be looking for some armor, so how is it?」<br>
「How did you know?」<br>
「Well, I could understand with a look at you.」<br>
「……」<br>
「Ahh, so cautious. Whaーt, it’s pretty simple. Looking at your footwork, I can see that you’re quite skilled. And yet… Your armor is quite poor. You’d turned your eyes to many Armor Shops and Blacksmiths, so wouldn’t the only conclusion be that you’re looking for some armor?」</p>

<p>This guy’s not just your run-of-the-mille old man! Just who on earth is he?</p>

<p>This old man was the great Blacksmith from the rumors, it seems. I suppose that would also explain his keen observation from a moment ago?</p>

<p>Well, it’s convenient at least. He ended up finding us, so I’ll consider myself lucky.</p>

<p>「Amazing.」<br>
「<em>Wahahahaha!</em> Even though I look this old, I’ve still got a long way to go! So, why don’t you take a look at my shop?」<br>
「Mhm.」<br>
「Well then, this way.」</p>

<p>Guided by Gallus, we’re led to a store at the corner of the plaza. In the meantime, the gazes of innumerable people are turning their eyes to us in the surrounding area. Their stares stick, so it’s pretty uncomfortable.</p>

<p>『Eh? Isn’t everyone around looking here?』<br>
「Enemies?」<br>
『No, they’re not but……』</p>

<p>The gazes from merchant-like men are particularly terrifying. Fran, who misunderstands those stares as intimidating glares from enemies returns sharp glances around the area.</p>

<p>What on earth is going on?</p>

<p>「Ahh, don’t worry about it; it’s just pressure from greedy Armor merchants. I’ve driven them away in the past, but since then they’ve started persistently approaching people who’ve purchased items from my shop in order to sell them second-hand.」</p>

<p>No, no, isn’t that troubling in itself?</p>

<p>「Weーll, we’ll be going around back to get in, so be at ease. More importantly, what’re you looking for exactly?」</p>

<p>There’s no way I can feel relieved with just that… But there’s no helping it even if I worry about it. Rather than that, it was good luck to find a skilled Blacksmith, so we should take this chance no matter what.</p>

<p>「Why to me?」<br>
「I only sell to Adventurers who’ll actually use my wares. You, my dear, are one such person.」</p>

<p>What a stubborn craftsman. I don’t hate that, though.</p>

<p>『First, have him show you a sword.』<br>
「First, a Sword.」<br>
「<em>Haa?</em> Aren’t you already carrying a fine sword? This is the first time I’ve seen an Intelligent Weapon, you know?」</p>

<p>W-What?! How did he know? Appraisal? No, I have Appraisal Concealment. It’s impossible for it to have been exposed!</p>

<p>「…… Intelligent Weapon?」</p>

<p>Good performance, Fran! Keep up that deceit!</p>

<p>「Ahh, well… It doesn’t make a differenceー. I was just making sure. My eye is a little special you see, so even if you have Appraisal blocking Skills, I can still see a bit of information. Especially in regards to Equipment.」</p>

<p>There was such an ability?! Now that he mentions it, on top of having Appraisal and Discernment, he also had the God’s Eye Skill, didn’t he…? Is that its effect?</p>

<p>「Well, only an Intelligent Weapon would have its Attack Power and Magic Power Conductivity. Is that enough of an explanation, Sword?」<br>
『Well, I can understand in that case. This girl… I want Fran to be able to use a proper sword.』<br>
「<em>Oohh?</em> You really can talk? You really are intelligent! <em>Incredibleー incredibleー!</em>」<br>
『You look like a kid…』<br>
「Teacher also, sometimes.」<br>
『<em>Eh</em>, seriously?』<br>
「Really.」<br>
『<em>Aーhh</em>, well. I suppose in the face of something interesting, anyone would revert to the mind of a child.』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>I look over to old man Gallus who’s still frolicking around.</p>

<p>『… I’m the same as that?』</p>

<p>I’ll try to be a bit more prudent in the future.</p>

<p>「Oops, sorryー. I was just a bit excited. Anyways, looking at your performance, a different sword doesn’t seem like it’d be necessary.」<br>
『No, no. Did you look at it right? Old man, your swords are stronger. Like that sword over there.』</p>

<p>The High-Quality Steel Longsword (⁵) that I had seen in town earlier was made by this old man, no doubt about it. And in this shop similar weapons are all over the place. All of them were at least as strong as me, if not more.</p>

<p>Watching such weapons, I hold back feelings that seem like they’d make me cough up blood. How would a blunt weapon like me compare to them?</p>

        </div>
        

<p>「Well, only in terms of simple attack power. <em>Ahh</em>, I see. By any chance, do you know of Magic Power Conductivity?」<br>
『Magic Power Conductivity? I know of it, but…』<br>
「But do you know what it is, hmー? It’s pretty importaーnt.」<br>
『How is it important?』<br>
「It’s really important, you knoーw! It’s especially important when evaluating a sword!」</p>

<p>How! Enlighten me, already!</p>

<p>「It’s quite the wonderー.」<br>
『Explain in detail, please.』<br>
「Mmh. Magic Power Conductivity refers to the efficiency in which a piece of equipment can be clad in Magic Power. When it’s made use of, the weapon’s performance varies greatly.」<br>
『Hmmm.』<br>
「For example, this weapon:」</p>

<p>Gallus picks up a Dagger which was hung on the wall. Appraising it, I find that it’s made of Steel. Its Magic Power Conductivity is E.</p>

<p>「Its Magic Power Conductivity is E, which means the conduction efficiency is around 5%. And so, using 100 Magic Power, its attack power rises by 5.」</p>

<p>Gallus explains further by taking out a Dagger made out of Mithril. Its Magic Conductivity is C-, with a conduction efficiency of about 70%. In other words, pouring 100 MP into it results in an ATK increase of 70. With this, conductivity is definitely important. It allows the difference in performance to be overturned easily.</p>

<p>「Furthermore, efficiency isn’t the only thing that increases with conductivity ratings. The amount of time magic can be contained within the weapon also increases. In other words, effects imbued upon the weapon last longer.」<br>
『So, is Mithril’s conductivity of C- quite high?』<br>
「That’s right. Mithril is particularly superior when it comes to conduction efficiency. It’s no exaggeration to say that weapons exceeding C- exist on the market as well, but by giving priority to increased conductivity, their basic attack power is low. In most cases, at least.」<br>
「Then, A is amazing.」<br>
「Mmh. Swords with a conductivity of A are pure Magic Swords; they have a conduction efficiency of 200%. Frankly, regular weapons pale in comparison.」</p>

<p>200%… So if 100 magic power is put in, ATK raises by 200? That’s absurdly strong, isn’t it?! I suppose that means my time has come?</p>

<p>『Is there a limit to the amount of magic power put into the weapon?』<br>
「That depends on the materials. As for your material…… I don’t understand it very well. Halmolium (⁴) seems to be the base, but there seem to be a mix of magic metals as well……」</p>

<p>Fran hands me over to Gallus, and he taps me with a hammer with a <em>*concon*</em> as if to be certain.</p>

<p>「You don’t seem to be inferior to Orichalcum, so about 1,000 magic power wouldn’t a be a problem I think. Well… Normally most people wouldn’t possess such an enormous amount of magic power in the first place — even the Court Magician in the Royal Capital can barely reach 800 MP, after all!」</p>

<p>Disregarding Gallus who’s laughing with a <em>*Gahahaha!</em>*, I internally break out into a cold sweat. For me… I can supply 1,000. In other words, I can increase my ATK by 2,000…? I had always found it a little strange up until this point. I could defeat seemingly-difficult opponents in one shot. Aiming at their vitals combined with acceleration via Telekinesis probably contributed as well, but…… I had probably wrapped myself in Magic Power unconsciously.</p>

<p>「Lasts how long?」<br>
「Well, that depends on the material. For E, it’s 5 minutes. Each successive rank increases that by about 2 minutes.」<br>
『Then, for A……』<br>
「It’d be 29-30 minutes.」<br>
「Long.」<br>
『That’s more than enough for a short-term battle.』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
『Then I’m not a dull sword?』<br>
「If you’re dull, then most of this world’s swords are dull as well.」<br>
『I see, so that’s how it is…… <em>Uoーh!</em> I’m gladー!』</p>

<p>I’m really, really glad! If I had eyes, tears would be pouring out from my happiness. I’ve become a sword in both body and mind. Finding out I was stronger than other swords, I didn’t think I’d become this pleased. Well… It isn’t an unpleasant feeling.</p>

<p>「You’re at the pinnacle of strength for a Magic Sword. You might even reach the feet of Divine Swords.」<br>
「Divine Sword?」 (⁶)<br>
「Mmh. Were you made by a Divine-class Blacksmith?」<br>
『Well… I don’t know. I have no memories of my creator.』<br>
「Is that so……」<br>
『Do you know something about it? If you do, please tell me.』</p>

<p>It feels quite bad not knowing my roots. And so, I want to know one way or another.</p>

<p>「You see, Blacksmiths have a ranking system.<br>
There’s the regular Blacksmith, Advanced Blacksmith, Magic Blacksmith, and finally Divine Blacksmith. There’re other Jobs derived from those as well, but the Job that reigns above them all is the Divine Blacksmith without a doubt. There’ve been no more than 5 people who have reached that level in the past. Truly, Blacksmiths of legend.」<br>
「5 Legendary people. Cool.」<br>
「For Blacksmiths like myself, they’re existences to admire. Divine Swords can only be forged by Blacksmiths of the Divine class.」<br>
『And you think a Divine Blacksmith made me?』<br>
「I think so, but I can’t be sure…… You’re quite weak compared to other Divine Swords, but you’re too strong to be a regular Magic Sword. You’re right in the middle.」<br>
『What’s with that… Then it could have just been a skilled Magic Blacksmith who made me?』<br>
「Well, that’s also a possibility.」<br>
『How much stronger are Divine Swords?』</p>

<p>I asked so purely out of curiosity. “How much stronger could such a sword be stronger than myself?” It was with such a thought.</p>

<p>「Divine Swords are said to be transcendent weapons that divide the sky and rend the land. In fact, there are records depicting such a sword taking the lives of over 10,000 people in only a matter of hours in a war of the past.」<br>
『Are they all swords?』<br>
「So long as it’s a weapon forged by a Divine Blacksmith, it’s referred to as a Divine Sword. It seems that there have been ones that don’t take the shape of swords, though.」<br>
「Seems?」<br>
「I’ve seen one such weapon. The Flame Sword: Ignis.」<br>
『I see. How much stronger was Ignis?』<br>
「When I had seen it my Appraisal Skill was low, so I couldn’t see it all, but…」</p>

<pre>Name：Flame Sword・Ignis 
ATK：1800　 

Magical Power Conductivity・SS 

Skills 
Flame Magic Bestowal, God Flame Bestowal, Unknown</pre>

<p>「That’s about it.」<br>
『Ahh, so it’s like that. I shouldn’t have held any form of rivalry in my heart… There’s no way that I’m a Divine Sword.』<br>
「Don’t be like that… As a sword, aren’t you plenty strong enough?」<br>
『Consoling an inferior sword? What a nice old man you are!』<br>
「You’re a good sword. I’m happy to have met such an interesting weapon!」<br>
『<em>Old man Gallus!</em>』<br>
「<em>Sword!</em>」</p>

<p>Disregarding us, Fran who lost interest in us started browsing the rest of the shop.</p>

<p>「Nn. This Breastplate is good.」</p>

<hr>
<p>(¹) Like Erofu — just with “old man”. In other words, a perverted old man.</p>

<p>(²) Regarding some of the Skill names:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Dedication (不眠不休) is actually “Without sleep or rest”.</li>
	<li>Smithing Magic (or more accurately Blacksmithing Magic — 鍛冶魔術) and Magic Blacksmithing (魔法鍛冶) are extremely similar, but are different things. I’m not sure what Smithing Magic would look like, but… Well, there it is.</li>
	<li>Discernment (目利き) is not Appraisal (鑑定).</li>
</ul>

<p>(³) クランゼル = Kuranzeru, unless someone has a better suggestion</p>

<p>(⁴) ハルモリウム =  — it seems to be an ingot-type from the Atelier series that’s composed entirely out of pure Orichalcum.</p>

<p>(⁵) Translated it as “good-quality” before. Not sure why. It should be “high”.</p>

<p>(⁶) Fran actually says “Magic Sword? Divine Sword?” probably as a “What’s the difference” question, but in English just asking for what one article is would be enough to understand the difference. 「魔剣？　神剣？」</p>

        <h1>Chapter 24: Equipment Acquisition</h1>

<p>「<em>Gahahaha!</em> Sorry for leaving you alone, miss!」<br>
「Un.」<br>
『I’m enough in terms of weaponry. I’d like you to make me a sheath instead, is that fine?』<br>
「<em>Ou!</em> I’ll make the best sheath you’ve ever seen!」<br>
『We can’t pay you too much, though…… We want other equipment as well, after all.』<br>
「Is that so~? How much is your budget?」<br>
『Leaving some for lodging and medicine, about 150,000 Gorudo.』</p>

<p>We’ll be buying cheap protective gear, but Gallus is a renowned Magic Blacksmith. 150,000 might be a bit low.</p>

<p>「Really. Alright, because I like you guys, I’ll sell you one set of equipment and a sheath for that much.」<br>
『Is that really alright? I’m saved.』<br>
「This much is fine! Then, what kind of armor would you like? I may be a Blacksmith, but I can also work with leather. I don’t mind whatever you choose.」<br>
『Hmm. Well, what do you think?』<br>
「Lighter is good.」<br>
「Leather then. My recommendation is to use steel to strengthen the areas that cover your vitals.」<br>
「I see.」<br>
「What about headgear?」<br>
「Better with none. Bad visibility.」<br>
「Then, perhaps an earring for Beastmen? There’re types that don’t need a piercing, if you’d like.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「Just a moment, then.」</p>

<p>Old man Gallus takes multiple pieces of equipment out from a storehouse of some sort. There’re various kinds.</p>

<p>「Try out whichever one catches your eye.」</p>

<pre>Name ：Remodeled Breastplate of the Flame Bull 

DEF ：88　Durability ：330/330 

Effect ：Fire Resistance ↑ Low</pre>

<pre>Name ：Remodeled Gauntlet of the Paralysis Clawed Cat 

DEF ：39　Durability ：160/160 

Effect ：Impact Resistance ↑ Low, Paralysis Resistance ↑ Low</pre>

<pre>Name ：Boots of the Poison Wyrm

DEF ：52　Durability ：200/200

Effect ：Poison Resistance ↑ Low</pre>

<pre>Name ：Mithril Earring of the Cat Tribe

DEF：10　Durability：100/100

Effect ：Magic Resistance ↑ Low</pre>

<p>As a set, the DEF adds up to 189.</p>

<p>It’s weaker than the Guild Master’s equipment, but compared to most Adventurers around town it’s a bit strong. It’s better equipment than I had expected to receive.</p>

<p>The main color of the equipment is black, which suits Fran better than I had anticipated. In addition, two pieces of clothing without any defensive properties were also tailored for her.</p>

<p>『Is it alright giving us such strong equipment?』<br>
「It’s fine. Strong Adventurers should be equipped with strong equipment. Above all, this equipment is inferior compared to yourself, so it’s quite vexing. Well, anyways, I won’t go into the red or anything, so don’t worry about it.」<br>
『Well, Fran?』<br>
「Thank you.」<br>
「Come again in the future. It’s not every day I get an opportunity to analyze an Intelligent Weapon, after all.」<br>
『Isn’t that reason a bit strange?』<br>
「Don’t mind it. It’s for Appraisal and Discernment.」<br>
『Well, if that’s how it is…』<br>
「Bringing in materials is also welcome, you know? If you bring them in, I’ll lower the price of the equipment made out of it.」</p>

<p>At his words I remembered the strong Demonic Beasts’ materials I had stored. Since I won’t be selling them to the Guild, wouldn’t passing them to old man Gallus for the sake of better equipment be as inconspicous as it gets?</p>

<p>「Materials.」<br>
『That’s right. I’d like you to make some protective gear out of them to dispose of them without attracting attention, old man.』<br>
「<em>Hou.</em> Putting it like that, their quality must be quite substantial.」<br>
『They’re not from small-fry Demonic Beasts. They’re from beings with threat levels of D and C.』</p>

<p>It wouldn’t be strange for an entire Country to take action for Demonic Beasts of Threat Level C. If one such creature appears near a town, the armed forces appearing soon after would be expected.</p>

<p>Even for Adventurers, they’re dangerous to the degree that you’d need at least 3 parties — more than 15 people — of Silver ranks.</p>

<p>『Are there any vacant rooms we can use?』<br>
「Yeah, there’s an empty room over there. Did you bring them with you?」<br>
「We did.」<br>
「You have an item bag, then? But where……」</p>

<p>No item bags can be seen from the figure of Fran. She only has clothes, sandals, and me equipped currently.</p>

<p>『It’s an ability of mine.』<br>
「I see. Interesting… For a Sword to have an item box ability…… I had no idea…」</p>

<p>While the old man murmurs and mumbles to himself, I was moved to the vacant room. It was likely a warehouse of some sort originally. It has a dirt floor, a high ceiling, and a sizeable area. I have no complaints.</p>

<p>『Then, I’ll take them out.』</p>

<p>I take out the fur, fangs, and claws of the Tyrant Saber. Next are the poisonous fangs and scales of the Doppel Snake, and followng that is the shell and skin of the Blast Tortoise. With just that, the room was filled with materials.</p>

</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>For the materials of the large Slime Lord, I left them stored and simply conveyed their existence verbally. The whole room would be covered with its slimy liquid if I took it out, after all.</p>

<p>「What the……?! D-Did you kill these? Despite them being materials of high-level C and D ranks?」<br>
『Well…』<br>
「Alone?」<br>
『To be precise, it was just me. I had used Telekinesis to soar around at that time.』<br>
「<em>Hahahahahaha!</em> How fierce! You must have quite the variety in abilities.」<br>
『If one’s basic abilities are low, versatility is key.』<br>
「If it’s this, then… Equipment of considerable quality can be made. It’ll be gear at a level that would be out of reach to a bronze rank.」</p>

<p>That should be expected, it’s material of only strong Demonic Beasts after all.</p>

<p>「However, these are all leather materials. <em>I can’t handle it all alone. I’ll have to cooperate with someone. After <strong>that</strong>, that guy’ll —</em>」<br>
『Um, old man?』<br>
「Oops, excuse me. Because there’s such interesting work after a long time, I’ve grown a tad excited. I wonder how many times you’ll surprise me before you’re satisfied!」</p>

<p>While saying so, a big smile floats on his face.</p>

<p>「Then, will you?」<br>
「Of course!」<br>
『However, it’ll be a custom-made set provided by a skilled artisan. How much would be sufficient old man?』<br>
「That’s right…… Even with materials provided, the price usually wouldn’t dip below 2,000,000 Gorudo.」<br>
『Seriously? That’s absolutely impossible.』<br>
「This material… Is it fine if I take it all?」<br>
『Aah, yeah that’s fine.』<br>
「Then, the negotiations’ll be simple. There’re far too many materials for the equipment of the young lady alone, so I’ll buy the surplus materials. For the price, how about we settle with a complete offset of the crafting cost?」<br>
『That’d be a great help.』<br>
「Alright, deal.」<br>
「How long?」<br>
「It’ll take one month.」<br>
『It’ll take longer than expected,』<br>
「What are you saying? That time is <em>already</em> pushing it! Well, that’s just because of the material, of course. It’s an odd job, for sure, but thankfully there’re enough raw materials to work with, so it’ll work out one way or another.」<br>
『It can’t be helped. What do you think, Fran?』<br>
「Nn. Looking forward.」<br>
「<em>Ou!</em> Leave it to me!」</p>

<p>Old man Gallus then proceeds to prepare several iron barrels to load the body of the Slime Lord into. The slime seems to have multiple uses.</p>

<p>「I’ve looked already, but… Are there no Magic Stones in these?」<br>
「None.」<br>
「Really. That’s too bad.」<br>
『Can Magic Stones be used in equipment as well?』<br>
「<em>Ou.</em> During creation, I can mix them in. For example, using the fang of this Doppel Snake Poison Resistance is assured for armor; for weapons, toxic effects would be expected. However, those effects would increase with the addition of the Doppel Snake’s Magic Stone. Using other stones would also apply an effect, but the materials have a natural affinity with the Magic Stone of the same kind.」</p>

<p>To think that Magic Stones had such a use… Unfortunately, their Magic Stones have already been absorbed by me. Perhaps I should leave Magic Stones that have Skills I have already in the future. They can be absorbed from storage at any time if they turn out useless.</p>

<p>『I’ll be careful in the future.』<br>
「<em>Ou</em>, that’s good then.」<br>
『Then I suppose we’ll take our leave for today.』<br>
「Bye bye.」<br>
『I’m sorry for troubling you in various ways.』<br>
「Hahaha! Just look forward to the finished products! Make sure to come back for the sheath in 3 days, too.」<br>
『Understood.』</p>

<p>Because we had processed the materials, strong armors could be ordered. Really, it was quite a good encounter.</p>

<p>『You look good, Fran. You match the look of a fledgling Adventurer to a tee.』<br>
「Thank you.」<br>
『Next is…… Do you need underwear?』<br>
「 ? Not really.」<br>
『I-Is that so?』</p>

<p>Because she said so, it’s alright, right?</p>

<p>No, that won’t do. Certainly the hurdle is high when it comes to lingerie and undergarments, but if I back away now, I’ll end up running away forever! If I do so, Fran will lose quality as a lady!</p>

<p>Here and now, I must take the offensive!</p>

<p>『That’s no good. We’re going to buy some underwear!』</p>

<hr>
<p> “Wyrm” should actually be “Sub/Inferior Flying Dragon”, but “Boots of the Poison Sub-Dragon” sounds kinda… Well… Weird. Especially because the Wyvern way back when was a sub-dragon of sorts, making the identity of the boots’ materials quite vague compared to other gear. If you have a better recommendation, lay it on me. 劣飛竜.</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 25: *Dokidoki* — I’m a guy, after all</h1>

<p>It’s been 10 minutes since we left old man Gallus’ shop.</p>

<p>『Here it is.』<br>
「Frilly.」</p>

<p>As Fran said, looking through the store window a lot of frilly women’s clothing are displayed.</p>

<p>『Because it’s a shop specializing in women’s clothing.』<br>
「Buying what?」<br>
『What do you mean, what?』<br>
「 ? 」<br>
『Well, it’s fine. Let’s enter.』</p>

<p>My heart isn’t pounding just a little, currently. Well, I don’t have a heart to begin with but… Any man would react like this. In addition, this is the first time I’ve entered such a shop — I hadn’t done so even in my past life.</p>

<p>「Welcome!」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「An? An Adventurer?」</p>

<p>Coming out from the back of the shop is a vulgar delinquent-like young woman. She has deep blue short-cut hair, and is wearing impressive cyberpunk-looking clothing, exceeding my expectations of a fantasy.</p>

<p>「And? What do you want? We’ve got underwear, lingerie, casual clothing, formal attire, pretty much everything. What’re you looking for?」<br>
（What are we getting?）<br>
『Just say as I say.』<br>
（Understood.）</p>

<p>We’ll give the general idea, and then push rest onto the saleswoman.</p>

<p>「Underwear for 5 days. Easily washable: good.」<br>
「Uh-huh.」<br>
「Also, clothing and underclothes for under armor.」<br>
「5 days worth of those as well?」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「For underwear, I’ll assume the lowest size would fit. Got any preferences?」<br>
「Appropriate.」<br>
「That’s no good for a cute girl like you!」</p>

<p>This lady was once an Adventurer. She had conceded on getting sturdy underwear for the sake of adventuring, but she was dissatisfied with there being few cute ones to choose from, so she took action. Uniting with the storekeeper of this store, she had developed various articles for female Adventurers.</p>

<p>「For a fair-skinned, black-haired, black eared beauty like yourself, this one might be good.」</p>

<p>What? Black panties!? Moreover, one with a fascinating tail hole? Outrageous. Truly, outrageous!</p>

<p>「This series has a hole in it specifically for Beastmen. How is it?」</p>

<p>Well… Isn’t it a bit too mature for Fran? It’s still a bit too early. Cuter ones would be more suitable. While thinking such, the young lady introduces other goods.</p>

<p>「Or perhaps something like this?」</p>

<p>— T-Those are striped panties, no doubt about it. Moreover, they’re ones with stripes of light blue and white!</p>

<p>「These, too.」</p>

<p>Kuh — S-Stop! Don’t make me look at the modest-shaped cream colored underwear decorated with small ruffles and bows…!</p>

<p>More enchanting types of underwear are unleashed in sequence, all of which are strong yet elastic.</p>

<p>「We also offer a service to open tail holes in articles which don’t already have them, you know?」<br>
「Then, these.」<br>
「Ok, Ok. Anything else?」</p>

<p>Is there anything else needed? Girl stuff…… Cleansing foam? No, I suppose a face-washing tool?</p>

<p>「Facial-wash tools? If you have them.」<br>
「We do. The ones at the side suppress dirt really well.」<br>
「Then, please.」<br>
「Got it.」</p>

<p>Apparently, there don’t seem to be any bras. Perhaps this country’s civilization isn’t advanced to the point where they exist yet?</p>

<p>Fran is small — perhaps similar to a cliff. Well, because she has that tsurupetaattribute bras aren’t necessary for the time being.</p>

<p>「So: 5 days worth of underwear and underclothes, along with shirts and short pants made with materials permitting good airflow. Would you like any of those with longer lengths?」<br>
「Yeah. Two long ones.」<br>
「Alright. After that is facial soap and towels.」</p>

<p>There’s soap? Is it the same as the soap on Earth?</p>

<p>「I made the soap exclusively for the face with Alchemy. It’ll cleanse the skin and make it smooth; it’s also odorless for the sake of female Adventurers, you know?」</p>

<p>Really? That’s pretty good. You’d be discovered by a Demonic Beast in no time if you smelled of flowers while on the hunt, so it’s quite helpful if it’s odorless.</p>

<p>「Thank you for your patronage!」</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>I’ll have to teach Fran how to wash her clothes later. If I do a bad job, she might not have any spare clothing left over… I should do it? No way, that’s dangerous in various ways. She’ll have to do it for herself. I’d feel like dying if Fran saw my work and judged it as garbage, after all.</p>

<p>◇◆◇</p>

<p>30 minutes after everything was sorted out, we’re standing in front of an inn. The lady from the clothing store had recommended it when we asked. A lot of female Adventurers use it, it seems.</p>

<p>Its appearance is neat, so it doesn’t seem to be that bad.</p>

<p>Upon entering… Its interior is also clean, and there’re even flowerpots placed around. I use Telekinesis to scrub a small corner of the entrance, but there’s no dust. Mmh, it’s a good inn.</p>

<p>「Teacher: worrywart.」<br>
『Wha–!』</p>

<p>I’m only like this for your sake! Fran!</p>

<p>「Welcome.」</p>

<p>At the counter is a young lady. She seems to be a bit over 20 years old.</p>

<p>「Rooms available?」<br>
「Would it be a room for one?」<br>
「Nn, alone.」<br>
「Are there any people to serve as your guardians?」</p>

<p>As expected, is it no use for a child to go in all alone?</p>

<p>『Fran, take out your Guild Card.』<br>
「Nn. This.」<br>
「Eh? Is this real?」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>The woman stares at the Guild Card for a little while, and finally comes to the understanding that it’s the genuine article.</p>

<p>「Well, with this your identity has been cleared. It’s 300 Gorudo for a room without meals. 400 Gorudo will cover the room and two meals. Each room within the inn is private. So, what would you like?」<br>
『A stay for one day, meals provided.』<br>
「One night with meals.」<br>
「Understood. Here’s the key to your room, please be careful with any valuables in your possession.」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>After that, she went through an explanation about the prices of commodities and such, like how Lanterns and hot water are provided through the use of Magic Tools. I was surprised when she mentioned toothbrushes, but it seems that they simply make use of Purification Magic somehow.</p>

<p>「You can exchange this tag at the dining room for a meal. The dining room is always open, so it can be exchanged at any time.」</p>

<p>While saying so, she passed us two exchange tags. They must have a good system in place to allow their guests to dine at any time.</p>

<p>Well, because I have a plentiful supply Demonic Beast meat, I could probably go without the meals anyways. From now on, perhaps it would be best to simply prepare our own meals instead… Any number of dishes can be placed in Dimensional Storage, so hot foods could be eaten at any time.</p>

<p>The only problem would be where to make the food. Roasted meals and soup would become boorish after a while, so order to prepare for various meals proper kitchen utensils will be required.</p>

<p>「Here?」<br>
『This room isn’t that bad.』</p>

<p>There’s a bed, a desk, and a chest set to the side; the room is completely spotless. Furthermore, dancing clothes are provided, likely in order to spend time comfortably. Finally, there’s a spot on the wall in order to hang one’s armor. This inn has a service to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>「Teacher, alright here?」<br>
『 ? 』<br>
「Such a great room?」</p>

<p>Ahh, so that’s it. Fran has lives as a slave for more than four years, so this room of this level would probably seem incredibly luxurious.</p>

<p>This poor child! I will absolutely make her happy! But first, I should relieve her!</p>

<p>『This is our room.』<br>
「Very luxurious…」<br>
『No, it’s not that amazing. This is common.』<br>
「Really?」<br>
『Really. From now on, you can stay in rooms like this without reserve.』<br>
「Uoー!」</p>

<p>Fran pushes both fists to the sky in a manly way and lets out a roar.</p>

<p>「It was good to follow Teacher.」<br>
『Is that so?』<br>
「Already: winners at life.」<br>
『It’s to that extent?!』<br>
「It’s my time.」</p>

<p>She’s already happy at an unreasonable level, and her spirits have risen. It’s hard to see from her facial expressions…</p>

<p>But it’s good so long as she likes it.</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 26: Saーber Tigeーr </h1>

<p>We relaxed a bit at the inn, but we’re not finished with shopping just yet.</p>

<p>『Hey, let’s go shopping before sunset, alright?』<br>
「Buying?」<br>
『Seasoning and cooking utensils. It’d be nice to eat delicious things when we’re camping out, right?』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
『Then we’ll need seasoning.』<br>
「Important. Top priority.」<br>
『Then let’s head out to a general store. If we ask someone from the inn, they’ll likely be able to tell us about one.』<br>
「Understood.」<br>
『Just in case, remember to lock up. We haven’t left anything, but…』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>We were recommended to a shop by one of the ladies at the inn. Its location was apparently just across the street.</p>

<p>『Here it is.』</p>

<p>The sign out front reads 「General Shop Saーber Tigeーr 」.</p>

<p>「Saーbeーr?」<br>
『It doesn’t look like a general store at all.』<br>
「No choice but here.」</p>

<p>As Fran said, this is the only general shop nearby. A bit reluctantly, we enter.</p>

<p><em>*curran curran*</em> </p>

<p>「Welcomeー!」</p>

<p>It’d be a fairly normal looking general store on the inside… If there wasn’t a macho man as the owner. He had only said 「Welcomeー」, but a transcendent throaty sound reverberated throughout the store. Without the consonant mark, his speech would have been a whole other level of manly.</p>

<p>「General store?」<br>
「That’s right. Although it’s often misunderstood, this is indeed a general store.」</p>

<p>Of course it would be misunderstood. It’s called Saーber Tigeーr. Furthermore, a macho man who wouldn’t look out of place prowling a dungeon is the clerk. You can understand just through his movement that his appearance isn’t just for show, either. Shall I Appraise him?</p>

<p>That’s <em>not</em> the status of a Merchant. That’s the status of an intermediate Adventurer — one with the Skills and constitution of a Vanguard, too! His Arithmetic and Commerce Skills are the ones that seem out of place instead!</p>

<p>「Adventurer?」<br>
「Originally, yeah. I had always dreamed of opening up a store of my own, so I worked to accumulate the funds needed. I retired from the life of an Adventurer 3 years ago and finally fulfilled my dream.」<br>
「Why the name? Not cute.」</p>

<p>Ms. Fran, please be a bit less direct!</p>

<p>「<em>Haha</em>, that’s asked often. I wonder why… To tell you the truth, when I was opening my shop I wanted something to attract attention. In the end, I decided to display that.」</p>

<p>The shopkeeper points the the wall at the back of the store, where a stuffed Saber head is displayed. It has a forceful expression that makes it seem like it could roar at any moment.</p>

<p>「Cool.」<br>
「<em>Right?</em> It’s a bit unpopular around women, though. Even though it’s so cool.」</p>

<p>Is this store really alright? If it wasn’t referred to by the lady at the inn, I’d run away as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>However, while Fran was making conversation I had looked around the store. The selection is actually quite good. Not just seasonings, convenient goods are all over the place.</p>

<p>「Ah, but I’m getting in the way of your shopping. Please, take your time.」<br>
『Well, let’s get what we came for then.』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>Naturally we’re buying salt and an assortment of herbs, but I’d also like expensive things like sugar and spices. We’ll also be buying dishes and utensils afterward.</p>

<p>But isn’t the security around here a bit careless? This world is different from Japan; it’s a dangerous place. Undoubtedly robberies happen. And yet, this shop exhibits its products just like Japan, making use of a system that allows the customer to choose their products directly. Couldn’t shoplifters act as much as they’d like……? No, maybe not. The owner’s a former Adventurer, so he wouldn’t overlook amateur shoplifting. It’s likely that he’s able to use this style of showing his products because he’s confident in his abilities.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>In the end, we purchased about 3,000 Gorudos worth of items and left the shop. It seems that we were thought of as good customers. In addition to being told to come again, the shopkeeper passionately saw us off personally.</p>

<p>『As for our remaining funds… There’s a little over 40,000 Gorudo, huh.』<br>
「What next?」<br>
『I’d like to buy Potions, but……』</p>

<p>We won’t be able to buy any expensive Potions.</p>

<p>「Recovery Magic.」<br>
『At its level it’s only the degree of soothing.』<br>
「Raise level?」<br>
『I considered that.』</p>

<p>I have 18 Self-Evolution Points remaining. 2 Points are necessary to raise the Skill’s level, so I could increase its level 9 times. In other words, I have enough Points to get a Skill from Lv1 to the Max.</p>

<p>『There are still some Skills that I’d like to raise.』<br>
「Which ones?」</p>

<p>Sword Techniques for example. After the examination at the Adventurer’s Guild, the Guild Master had called Dragon・Fang a medium-grade Sword Technique. A Sword Technique of Lv7 is medium-grade. And so, just like Magic Skills, if I get Sword Techniques to LvMax something’ll happen, right? That’s what I think, anyways.</p>

<p>「Un. I think, too.」<br>
『Right?』</p>

<p>Also, because the power of Sword Techniques depends on the level of Sword Arts, in order to make full use of them Sword Arts needs to have its level raised as well.</p>

<p>After that would be Fission Creation. It’s pretty useless right now, but if I raise its level… Wouldn’t it be possible to use it in combat just like the Doppel Snake did? It would also save a lot of trouble if I could use a doppel body as Fran’s guardian when she goes out shopping.</p>

<p>「Good.」<br>
『Right?』</p>

<p>After that would be Skills for the sake of life preservation, like Instant Recovery, Abnormal Status Resistance, and Physical Attack Resistance. They’re simple, but they’ll be overwhelmingly reliable in a predicament. Moreover, those three Skills seem to have severe acquisition conditions: the so-called Top Skills.</p>

<p>Fran’s still a low level, so taking a single attack from an a Demonic Beast above intermediate rank would be the end. It can’t hurt to be too careful until she becomes a high level.</p>

<p>「Forgot.」<br>
『I’ll be keeping Instant Recovery active, so it shouldn’t be too bad for the time being.』</p>

<p>And then there’s Recovery Magic. Instant Recovery is a good skill, but it’d be great to be able to heal other people.</p>

<p>I want to raise its level intensively, rather than leave it incomplete.</p>

<p>『Well, any Skills are good enough.』</p>

<p>In the end, after more consultation at the inn, I ended up raising Recovery Magic to the counter stop. It now allows Abnormal State recovery, so it’s convenient. Even if Fran sustains a major injury it can be healed, too.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Healing Magic Lv1 was obtained. Just like how Flame Magic was obtained from Fire Magic, it was obtained after Recovery Magic reached its peak.</p>

<p>『With this, our means of recovery are secured.』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
『Now then, what shall we do tomorrow? Perhaps we should take a request from the Adventurer’s Guild? There’s still money left over, so we could relax for several days if you’d like.』<br>
「Take request.」<br>
『Is that alright? We’ll probably end up going out of the town.』<br>
「Ready.」<br>
『Then, let’s go to the Guild tomorrow.』<br>
「Un. Looking forward to Adventurer work.」<br>
『<em>Ou</em>. We’ll have to take some time to raise your level, too.』<br>
「After that?」<br>
『What would you like to do? We can do anything you’d like.』<br>
「Anything……」<br>
『<em>Ou</em>. Is there anything you’d like to do?』<br>
「Un……?」<br>
『<em>Hahahaha!</em> You should think long and hard about it. We have plenty of time.』<br>
「Un. I will.」</p>

        <h1>Chapter 27: These Guys Again</h1>

<p>This is the first morning that I’ve woken up at an inn.</p>

<p>Murmuring 『I don’t know this ceiling…』 was simply a matter of course. Well, I didn’t lie down because I don’t sleep, but…</p>

<p>I move Fran who seems like she’s weak to mornings, and proceed to change her clothes. I clean her with Purification Magic and wash her face using water — also created by magic. Fran’s hair is shortcut with curls swaying often move at the ends, so I don’t forget to fix her terrifically disheveled morning hair with water as well.</p>

<p>After I’ve finished, Fran finally awakes.</p>

<p>「Good morning.」<br>
『Did you sleep well?』<br>
「Very.」</p>

<p>Next, we head out to the dining room for breakfast.</p>

<p>「Got it. Please look forward to our morning special!」</p>

<p>A wooden plate is placed in front of Fran with a <em>*don*</em>. The meal consists of an omelet atop a firm piece of brown bread, 2 sausages, and a serving of boiled carrots. There’s also a soup with a couple of other ingredients within.</p>

<p>『How is it?』<br>
「Delicious.」</p>

<p>To Fran who was formerly a slave, this meal must be incredibly delicious — or so I think such while watching her eat with gusto. There, there. Eat a lot to grow big and strong.</p>

<p>（However, Teacher’s cooking: more delicious.）</p>

<p>During yesterday’s dinner she said the same thing.</p>

<p>『<em>Haha</em>, what a nice thing to say.』<br>
（It’s true. I want Teacher’s Cooking.）</p>

<p>Well, my Cooking Skill has reached the counter stop. Because of that, we’re now in the mysterious situation of a sword being the best chef in town. In fact, even though Fran has the same Cooking level as me, I’m a better cook — likely due to my memories of my past life. Even with the Cooking King Title and the best abilities, it’s impossible to match up to food that’s never been seen on this world it seems.</p>

<p>It might really become necessary to give thought to preserving large quantities of food created through my Cooking Skill…</p>

<p>『If we get a request that requires us to leave the town, I’ll cook some lunch.』<br>
「Looking forward. Must go immediately.」<br>
『Then you’ll have to look for a request.』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>We left for the Adventurer’s Guild after the meal.</p>

<p>「Hello.」<br>
「Good morning. Have you come to find a request?」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「The request board is that one over there. Make sure to remember that G Rank Adventurers can only receive G and F Rank requests.」</p>

<p>First, we take a look at the G Rank requests.</p>

<p>There’re few G Rank Adventurers here early in the morning it seems, so there’s no one in front of the board.</p>

<p>『Harvest Medical Herbs, Hunt Wild Boars, Pluck Weeds from around an Estate, and Pick Garbage off the Road…?』<br>
「Dull.」<br>
『Yeah. The compensation is low, too.』</p>

<p>Next we look at the F Rank requests.</p>

<p>『They’re better, but……』</p>

<p>Subjugate 5 Goblins, Exterminate Fang Rats, and Gather Mushrooms from the Forest.</p>

<p>The fact that they’re all dull hasn’t changed.</p>

<p>Well, it can’t really be helped that only requests of this level are present. Besides, Fran’s level is low, so it would be best to raise Fran’s level by hunting small fry.</p>

<p>「Then, this.」<br>
『Medical herb harvesting. It’s our first request, so that would be for the best, right?』</p>

<p>In more detail, the request consists of gathering medicinal herbs used for fifth grade Potions: Heal Grass. There’re a lot of them grown in the forest, apparently.</p>

<p>「This.」<br>
「Yes. This request, then. I’ve confirmed it.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「Do you know what Heal Grass looks like? There’re documents you can look at if you’d like.」<br>
「I’m OK.」<br>
「I see. You’ll need to complete 5 requests in order to rank up, so do your best.」<br>
「Nn. Thank you.」<br>
「Yes.」</p>

<p>We made a big commotion yesterday, but it seems that the Adventurers’ favorability towards Nell was high enough to cover for it. Good, good.</p>

<p>『Alright. Let’s go!』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>After arriving at the gate, we showed our Guild Card and easily passed through. The gatekeeper seemed to remember Fran and was surprised to see that she was an Adventurer.</p>

<p>『So, which way shall we go?』<br>
「Nn…… That way.」<br>
『Following your heart?』<br>
「Intuition.」</p>

<p>That’s a good answer. There’s no hurry to complete the request, so it’s fine to behave like this.</p>

<p>『We should pick up medical herbs other than Heal Grass along the way. Then, if another request comes out for different herbs we can complete it immediately.』<br>
「Teacher: genius.」<br>
『<em>Hahaha!</em> Praise me more!』<br>
「Teacher: amazing genius.」</p>

<p>◇◆◇</p>

<p>We continue advance through the forest at a leisurely pace. We’ve already harvested enough Heal Grass at this point to complete the request, alongside other herbs, mushrooms, and nuts in large quantities.</p>

<p>Using the Harvesting, Herbalism, and Cooking Skills I can distinguish whether any of the herbs will be useful. Danger Perception also helps in the, because it allows me to sense dangerous mushrooms and herbs even without knowing their name or effects. In other words, it allows me to distinguish materials that can be used for poisons.</p>

<p>Everything’s stored in Dimensional Storage, so the only thing that could be considered a problem is the fact that we have to harvest them one by one. Fran seems to be satisfied with the meal that I cooked, so she’s walking in high spirits.</p>

<p>「Teacher.」<br>
『<em>Ou</em>.』</p>

<p>Abruptly, Fran stops. But I’m not surprised. I noticed too, after all.</p>

<p>『Goblins. There’re no more than 10 of them.』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
『There really are a lot of Goblins around here, huh.』</p>

<p>Fran’s hand is already gripping my handle in preparation for a fight, and I don’t stop her. Goblins can be hunted safely, and grant decent EXP, so they’re fine.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t recommend fighting off these numbers for common beginners, though.</p>

<p>『Is an Adventurer surrounded?』<br>
「There.」<br>
『3 Adventurers, huh. As for the Goblins……』<br>
「13.」<br>
『They’re high quality ones, too.』</p>

<p>A Soldier, Thief, and Archer seem to be leading the flock of Goblins.</p>

<p>Their opponents seem to be only novice Adventurers. Standing against the flock of Goblins dressed in cheap armor, they can only scowl with pale faces.</p>

<p>『A Soldier, a Ranger, and a Magician. The party’s balance is alright, but if the rearguard is approached too closely things would easily take a turn for the worst.』</p>

<p>All of the party’s members have received damage to some degree; the Magician in particular seems to have suffered a serious injury.</p>

<p>「I’ll rescue.」<br>
『Understood.』<br>
「Shave off with Magic, then break through.」</p>

<p>We both chant spells from Soil Magic in unison. My chant was for the spell Stone・Barrett, which fires off a small stones like a buckshot. Because my MGC is about 5 times higher than the average person, my stones have roughly the same power as bullets. If enemies are grouped up, it’s possible to hit multiple bodies at once.</p>

<p>My ability to guide the Skills also seems to be due to Sorcery, but because I can’t share it with Fran, she’ll have to use magic the normal way.</p>

<p>As for the reason we didn’t use Fire Magic, it’s because of our location. Forest fires are dangerous.</p>

<p>「Stone・Arrow.」<br>
『Stone・Barrett!』</p>

<p>Fran’s magic defeats one, and mine takes out five, so a total of 6 were defeated — one of which was the Goblin Thief.</p>

<p><code>〈Fran's Level has risen to 6〉</code></p>

<p>Level Up has come! Well, we have no choice but to ignore it for now.</p>

<p>While both sides are confused about what happened, Fran rapidly approaches the Goblins.</p>

<p>「<em>Hah</em>.」</p>

<p>She slides between the Adventurers and Goblins and cuts down two Goblins as she passes by. Of course, I’m also participating in the battle. I take care of the Goblin Archer that would provide the most difficulty for the Adventurers with Stone・Arrow.</p>

<p>「Eh? A child?」<br>
「S-Strong!」</p>

<p>The Adventurers are surprised. The Goblins were as well, but recovered and attempted to strike back with the Soldier Goblin as the lead.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>「<em>GyaGYAOU!</em>」</p>

<p><em>Hou</em>. Understanding that their opponent was strong, they attacked with all of their members without hesitation. In spite of being a Goblin, it has good judgment.</p>

<p>『But it’s futile! Stone・Barrett!』</p>

<p>I’ve continued chanting throughout the entire battle. I don’t even need to breathe to do so, after all. Because of that, the chant for Stone・Barrett was already complete.</p>

<p>Two Goblins to the right are impaled with stones, causing them to lose their lives after vomiting up blood.</p>

<p>As for two on the left, they aren’t even close to a match for Fran.</p>

<p>「Slow.」</p>

<p>Double・Slash is released, and the final two are cut down in an instant.</p>

<p>The situation had been turned on its head within just 20 seconds, so the Adventurers can only watch with befuddled expressions on their faces. I feel like continuing to stare at their goofy faces for a while longer, but it would be bad to leave the injured person as-is.</p>

<p>『Recovery Magic is already making itself useful.』</p>

<p>I check over the Magician’s status and find that his HP is simply decreased. There’re no physical defects or abnormal states.</p>

<p>『Just a regular Heal will do just fine.』<br>
「――Curing light, Group・Heal」</p>

<p>That spell is the wide-range Lv7 Recovery Magic: Group・Heal. Because the other two were more or less damaged, they were recovered with it as well. What a kind girl, using such a spell for their sake!</p>

<p>「Group・Heal? From such a small child?」<br>
「<em>Uah!</em> This isn’t some second-grade Magic!」</p>

<p>Astonished, the male Warrior and female Ranger let out words with wide eyes.</p>

<p>「Moreover, is that a Magic Sword…?」</p>

<p>Ah, I’ve been noticed. Well, there’s a clear difference between my appearance and regular swords, so my identity would be revealed to anyone who sees me. <em>Ahhー</em>, how troubling.</p>

<p>「That aside, Eustace, are you alright?!」<br>
「Huh? My injury was healed?」</p>

<p>The Magician doesn’t seem to have any problems. If he tries to coax Fran to buddy up with their group due to this situation, I might get angry, you know?</p>

<p>「Alright?」<br>
「Y-Yeah. I’m saved.」<br>
「Thank you very much. Hey, you too!」<br>
「Eh? T-Thank you?」</p>

<p>Bowing should come first, that’s just the basics. The fools from the other day seemed to have thought differently, however.</p>

<p>「You are…… An Adventurer?」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「Um, may I ask your name?」<br>
「Fran.」</p>

<p>After that word was spoken, the Adventurers turn to each other and start whispering to one another.</p>

<p>（Do you know that name?）<br>
（I don’t. But it’d be impossible not to know of such an outstanding child…）<br>
（Yeah.）<br>
（I don’t know either.）</p>

<p>Their conversation was probably along those lines.</p>

<p>「I’m Kral. She’s Lily, and he’s Eustace.」</p>

<p>The Warrior gives a polite introduction, but Fran seems to have already lost interest in them.</p>

<p>「I see. Then.」</p>

<p>It seems that she wants to confirm her Status as soon as possible.</p>

<p>『Is that alright? We might get a reward, you know?』<br>
（Compassionate. Want to see Status.）</p>

<p>Is that so. These guys look visibly inexperienced, so we couldn’t really expect a big reward from them anyways. However, while Fran was about to leave, the Warrior leader Kral quickly speaks up.</p>

<p>「Ah, please wait.」<br>
「 ? 」<br>
「These Goblins were the ones that you defeated.」<br>
「Eh? This girl took down all of these Goblins? What are you talking about?」<br>
「Just be quiet!」<br>
「You’ve already saved our lives, we can’t possibly accept anything more than that.」</p>

<p>He has good intentions, so a bad impression might be left if we decline him here.</p>

<p>『Perhaps just taking the materials from higher quality Goblins would be fine?』<br>
「Understood. I’ll take high quality.」<br>
「Eh? Highbreeds were mixed in?!」</p>

<p>Hey, hey, you didn’t even know that? It might be hard to tell looking at their basic appearance, but they’ve got bigger physiques and have larger horns.</p>

<p>「Nn.」</p>

<p>Fran ignores the surprise of the three people, and proceeds to strip the Highbreeds of any usable materials at her own pace. The faces of the Adventurers become a bit odd as we do so.</p>

<p>Fran takes the horns and Magic Stones into the bag hanging at her waist. It’s a dummy bag, of course. It’s simply used as a cover for the items to be put into Dimensional Storage.</p>

<p>「There were three of them?」<br>
「Isn’t that a bit dangerous? We should notify the Guild……」<br>
「No, no, wait. Are those really higher kinds?」<br>
「Probably. Their bodies are obviously a bit bigger than the rest.」</p>

<p>We seem to have made them more flustered than expected. A problem of some sort seems to have arisen.</p>

<p>「What?」<br>
「Well, three Highbreeds appeared at the same time, so it has to be reported to the Guild!」<br>
「Why?」<br>
「Huh? You don’t know?」<br>
「 ? 」<br>
「If Highbreeds are present, there’s a high chance a King has been born.」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>The Adventurers describe in detail, but here’s a rough summary:</p>

<p>When a Goblin King rises to leadership, the combat power of all of the Goblins increases significantly. I knew about this fact as well.</p>

<p>Becoming able to hunt more Demonic Beasts as a group, individual Goblins don’t die as often and more Highbreeds can come into existence. In turn, this increases the combat power of the horde and a terrible cycle is born.</p>

<p>In fact, once the horde grows big enough a Queen is born. A Queen was once born in the Plains, too. I suspect that the reason for its existence is to help unify the outskirts of the group when it’s grown really big.</p>

<p>Most importantly: children born to the King and Queen Goblins are all Hobgoblins. If the Hobgoblins breed with normal Goblins, their children are Hobgoblins as well.</p>

<p>A single Hobgoblin has a Threat Level of F. A group of them led by a King seems to surpass Threat Level D.</p>

<p>「Things get out of hand if it gets like that. It would become a disaster due to an outbreak of Demonic Beasts.」<br>
「I can’t even imagine how many villages would disappear…」</p>

<p>Indeed, for the local Adventurers this would be a matter of life and death. I can only looks at it it as a clump of delicious EXP, but for the present Fran the situation would pose quite a threat. That being the case, we should nip it at the bud.</p>

<p>「We’re going to immediately report it to the Adventurer’s Guild.」</p>

<p>Saying so, they each pick up a corpse of a Highbreed. Without the bodies, there would be no material serving as evidence after all.</p>

<p>「Nn.」<br>
「Then, please excuse us.」<br>
「Thank you for your help, really.」<br>
「It seems like I was saved by you, so thank you very much!」</p>

<p>And so, we helped some young people and ended up getting the rest of the materials from the Goblins for ourselves. It’s not a bad result.</p>

<p>『Now to absorb the Magic Stones.』</p>

<p>After moving away from the novice Party, I take out the Magic Stones and absorb them. I already have all of their Skills, but the accumulation of small things add up eventually. I received them gratefully.</p>

<p>「Hey, Status, look?」<br>
『Yes, yeーs. I’ll look now.』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<pre>Name ：Fran 　Age ：12 
Race ：Black Cat Beastman 
Job ：Magic Swordsman 
State ：Contracted 

Status:
Level ：6 
HP ：80　MP ：71　STR ：45　END ：34　AGI ：46　INT ：30　MGC ：36　DEX ：47</pre>

<p>The Status values are raising steadily. In particular, STR and MGC both rose by 4. That’s most likely an effect from being a Magic Swordsman.</p>

<p>Actually, the effects of being a Magic Swordsman are like this:</p>

<pre>Magic Swordsman ：Intermediate Job 
Requires Sword series Techniques and one Magic type at Lv6 or higher to acquire. 

Effect:
When leveling up, STR and MGC will be more likely to raise. Acquisition efficiency for Sword and Magic Skills will increase. The power of Sword and Magic techniques will increase.</pre>

<p>It’s a very well-balanced Job. I’ll tell Fran about the rises in her Status values.</p>

<p>「Good feeling.」<br>
『That’s right. Do your best, and it’ll keep increasing like this.』<br>
「Ooー!」</p>

<p>The expressionless Fran punching her fists into the air is too cute~ Alright! Let’s put in some fighting spirit and look for more prey!</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 28: Resolution and Growth</h1>



<p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p>It’s been one hour since we parted with the beginner party.</p>

<p>「Double・Slash!」<br>
「<strong>GYAGAGE!</strong>」<br>
「<em>Shu<strong>GYOGA</strong>ー!</em>」</p>

<p><code>〈Fran's Level has risen to 9〉</code></p>

<p>「It rose.」<br>
『Yes, yes. We’ll confirm the changes later.』</p>

<p>We’re currently at war with a crowd of Goblins.</p>

<p>I didn’t particularly intend to find their den, but we eventually became surrounded by Goblins after hunting them for EXP for a while. There’re ~100, probably. Furthermore, multiple Highbreeds are leading them.</p>

<p>『Middle・Heal!』<br>
「Saved.」<br>
『Here they come again!』</p>

<p><em>*hyuh hyuh hyuhyun hyun!*</em></p>

<p>A myriad of stones are thrown towards Fran through the gaps of trees. It seems that it’s not just stones, however. Wood chips and such are mixed within.</p>

<p>The Goblins in the surroundings are all throwing such things in unison. Because the attack is from all sides, avoiding would be impossible.</p>

<p>「Teacher!」<br>
『Aah, leave it to me. Fire・Wall!』</p>

<p>A dome of fire covers Fran’s body, protecting her from the projectiles. But their attack wasn’t over.</p>

<p>『They’re approaching!』<br>
「Nn!」</p>

<p>Fran takes a stance with me in her hands, and when the wall of flames disappears —</p>

<p>「<em><strong>GORURAA!</strong></em>」<br>
「<em>Gyo<strong>GYO</strong>ga!</em>」<br>
「<em><strong>Giy</strong></em><strong>ARU</strong><em><strong>ー!</strong></em>」</p>

<p>Ten Goblins attack Fran simultaneously. Two of them jumped too early, and crashed into Fire・Wall, causing them to be engulfed in flames and writhe along the ground.</p>

<p>「Heavy・Slash!」</p>

<p>We pass through the crowd exchange blows with the Goblins. Doing so, 5 Goblins were immediately defeated.</p>

<p>「<em>Gyaha!</em>」<br>
「<strong><em>KU</em></strong>……」<br>
「Gush<em>IHAA</em>!」<br>
「<em>AU!</em>」</p>

<p>Striking the Goblins, Fran’s small body dances while being colored bright red. Swords tear at her shoulders and Spears bore into her back,</p>

<p>but Fran bears the pain and continues to hold me in her hands. I wanted to suggest setting Pain Reduction, but losing ones’ sense of pain might adversely lead to even more damage.</p>

<p>「<em>KAAH!</em>」</p>

<p>The usually quiet Fran lets out a war cry and attacks the Goblins. With that, 10 more are defeated.</p>

<p>This battle of offense and defense has repeated several times, leading to the corpses of a little less than 40 fallen Goblins laying around Fran. Still, the number of Goblins surrounding Fran don’t seem to have decreased.</p>

<p>『Middle・Heal!』<br>
「<em>Fuu… Haa…</em>」<br>
『Oi, Fran! Are you alright?』<br>
「…… Alright.」<br>
『We should escape soon. There’re other methods of gaining EXP, ones even more efficient than this.』</p>

<p>We made light of their numbers… The numbers that the Goblins would put to war.</p>

<p>My body feels neither pain nor fatigue, and is repaired as soon as I sustain damage. For better or worse, I’m able to fight without struggling against strong Demonic Beasts.</p>

<p>But as a result… My sense of danger had been dulled. Things like it’s too dangerous, or that Fran wasn’t ready yet hadn’t even come to mind. I had thought from the bottom of my heart that we’d manage somehow with my power.</p>

<p>And yet, we’re now in a hard fight against the Goblins… But it’s too late to regret now.</p>

<p>In Recovery Magic is an auto-recovery spell that resurrects the target when their HP becomes 0 — although the Spell is only works once per chant. It’s difficult to die when one has this technique, and it makes victory only a matter of time.</p>

<p>But… How much pain would need to be endured, and how much blood would need to be shed until then? Fran still isn’t ready to endure such things. Remembering this fight might breed a trauma, so we should withdraw before that occurs.</p>

<p>『They’re coming again! We can still escape!』</p>

<p>If it’s through Floating and Aerial Jump, making our escape through ascent would be possible. The wall of Goblins would be easy to break through, too.</p>

<p>「Not running.」<br>
『W-What are you saying?! Getting hurt any more than this is pointless! If we go hunt larger Demonic Beasts we’ll gain even more EXP!』<br>
「Not pointless.」</p>

<p>Muttering so, Fran takes a stance with me once again. A look of strong determination appears on her face as she does so.</p>

<p>「With Teacher: I won’t die. Without dying: pain can be known. Can be used for battle. Then, experience is accumulated.」<br>
『 <strong>!</strong> 』<br>
「Fighting to the limit: necessary to be strong, I think. This is… The perfect battleground.」</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>Saying so, Fran has a ferocious smile.</p>

<p>Ah, I made light of Fran. She had resolved herself long ago. It was only me who wasn’t prepared.</p>

<p>My resolution to see Fran hurt wasn’t strong enough. Aren’t I too naïve? Certainly, if she’s led by me her level will rise. But would that really make her『strong』?</p>

<p>Experience and strength of will. Enduring pain can only happen in battle, so isn’t there no meaning in just having one’s level raised?</p>

<p>Fran understood that firmly.</p>

<p>「Teacher: guardian.」</p>

<p>Amazing. Unlike living snugly in Japan, readiness is different from being overprotected here.</p>

<p>Alright. I’ll also show my resolve. I’m prepared! No more hesitating! Let’s abandon my easy-going protective spirit! Even without my protection, she isn’t a weak kitten. She’s a fierce child —  a predator sharpening her fangs!</p>

<p>『Leave the recovery to me!』<br>
「<em>Nn!</em> I’m going!」</p>

<p>With that, Fran sprints. She plunges into the crowd of Goblins and swinging me to her heart’s content. And as for me, I put my heart and soul into supporting Fran as she accumulates combat experience.</p>

<p>In that way I noticed a change in Fran.</p>

<p>「<em>Ha!</em> <strong><em>Rah!</em></strong>」</p>

<p>Haven’t her movements become a bit amazing? Even though she isn’t using Sword Techniques, her thrusts almost match the speed of Triple・Thrust. Even now, with Double・Slash — no, its movement exceeds Double・Slash.</p>

<p>I had thought Fran was utilizing Sword Arts, but…… That doesn’t seem to be the case.</p>

<p>No, wouldn’t that be natural? Suddenly getting Sword Arts at a high level one day, it would be impossible for her body and mind to so easily adapt. So far we had been finishing off small fries and concluding out battles in an instant, so it wasn’t a problem… But now, fighting to her limit, her Skills and body have begun working in unison.</p>

<p>Until now only the sharpness of my blade could be admired, but that was only then. Now, things are different. Sword and Body are one. As the number of Goblins increase, the accuracy and ferocity of her attacks does as well.</p>

<p>◇◆◇</p>

<p>Two hours have passed.</p>

<p>「<em>Ha…… Ha……</em>」<br>
『Fran, you’ve done well!』<br>
「Nn……!」</p>

<p>The corpses, blood, and bodily fluids of the Goblins are littered across the ground; it was a disastrous scene that seemed to have come straight from hell. At the center, using me as a cane, Fran barely stands. There’re no wounds thanks to Recovery Magic, but her endurance has been stretched to the limit, as can be seen as her shoulders raise and fall intensely.</p>

<p>She’s covered in blood, dust, and mud to the extent that not a single surface of her skin is clean. Even the newly bought protective gear was dyed dark red. The damage of the armor in particular is quite terrible, so repairs will be necessary.</p>

<p>If I had attacked more proactively we probably wouldn’t have had such a hard fight<em>…</em> But it was necessary for it to be difficult.</p>

<p>Only 6 levels were gained, but the growth that Fran has shown exceeds such things. During the middle of the fight Goblins were defeated exclusively through smashing their Magic Stones — in other words, during the melee her skill had reached the point where I would pierce into the exact area of the opponents’ vital areas.</p>

<p>『–Stamina・Heal』</p>

<p>I cast a Magic used to recover one’s endurance, but mental fatigue won’t be cured through it.</p>

<p>『Rest a bit. I’ll remain vigilant of the surroundings.』</p>

<p>While I do so, I suppose I could secure any usable materials an absorb any remaining Magic Stones<em>…</em></p>

<p>「I’ll help.」<br>
『O-Oi. Are you really alright?』<br>
「Finish quickly: leave quickly.」<br>
『I see…… The King didn’t show up in the end, so we should finish before reinforcements come, then.』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
『Alright. Take care of their equipment and horns. As for me, I’ll focus on the absorption of Magic Stones.』<br>
「Understood.」</p>

                    <br>

        <h1>Chapter 29: Spoils from the Goblins</h1>

<p>『Most of it’s been collected.』<br>
「Lots.」<br>
『Ou. My Magic Stone Status reached almost 200 in one go.』</p>

<p>Even though there were a bunch of Highbreeds, there were surely more than 100 small fries.</p>

<p>『However, it seems that no Demonic Beasts are approaching.』<br>
「Nn. Pleasant.」</p>

<p>I had thought that the surrounding Demonic Beasts would be attracted to the smell of so much blood, but… They change direction suddenly as soon as they come near. Perhaps even with low intelligence they can still learn to fear the sight of such a disastrous scene. Well, collecting materials was easy because of that as Fran said.</p>

<p>『I obtained some new Skills, too. Moreover, it seems to only be interesting ones.』</p>

<p>Of the spoils obtained from the war against the Goblins, the largest is of course Fran’s growth. She’s improved in a variety of ways physically.</p>

<p>Also, with the exception of those that were broken or rusted, we’ve obtained 50 weapons made of Iron and Bronze. There were a couple of forageable suits of Armor as well, but… Well… Because they smelt terrible, most of them had to be discarded. We found a couple of Magic Items as well, which is a good harvest. I’ll have to examine them in detail later.</p>

<p>As for the new Skills:</p>

<p>I received Chant Shortening, Acrobatics, Retainer’s Contract, Kicking Techniques, Kicking Arts, Ghost Magic, Poison Absorption, Poison Magic, Axe Techniques, and Imperturbability.</p>

<p>These Skills came from a Hobgoblin Dark Mage, a Hobgoblin Necromancer, a Hobgoblin Grappler, and Hobgoblin Gladiator.</p>

<p>But that brings about a problem.</p>

<p>『There were Hobgoblins among them, huh.』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>The Four individuals which offered new Skills came from Hobgoblins — which have statuses exceeding the Goblin King from a while back. That can only mean that the Goblin Queen was already born, and breeding has already begin.</p>

<p>『Are the Goblins quick to grow?』<br>
「Un. 10 days: becomes adult.」<br>
『They’re seriously on the same level as insects… Anyways, in that case this could be quite dangerous, couldn’t it?』</p>

<p>There’s the possibility of Hobgoblins being bred in large numbers as we speak.</p>

<p>『It would be best to report back to the Adventurers Guild. I would have liked to hunt them all down with just us, but leaving the situation alone could lead to heavy damage.』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>For now, we should collect the Hobgoblin corpses —</p>

<p>『Fran!』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>I snap up and rush towards Fran, and she calmly catches me with a firm grasp.</p>

<p>「Over there!」<br>
「Oi, are these all Goblins?」<br>
「What is this devastation……?!」<br>
『It seems like we were spared the trouble.』</p>

<p>The new arrivals are Adventurers. Among them are the figures of the novices we had helped a couple of hours ago, so they seem to have completed their report of the Goblins and successfully got the Guild to send a dispatch.</p>

<p>Dangerous, dangerous. I was almost seen moving about freely.</p>

<p>「Lass, are you alright?!」<br>
「Are you injured?」<br>
「Alright.」<br>
「This…… Was this all done by you?」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>The 10 Adventurers have looks of surprise as Fran nods her head.</p>

<p>「This many…… With just one person?」<br>
「If that’s true, Rank E…… No, Rank D. A Rank D Adventurer could take care of an army of this size. It doesn’t seem like a small den, though… No, it’s far, far larger.」<br>
「Eh?! Rank D?!」<br>
「Seriously…?」</p>

<p>They seem to have come to that conclusion at their own convenience. Certainly an Adventurer’s Rank is associated with monsters’ Threat Levels, but…</p>

<p>The same Rank as the Demonic Beast is usually only given if a well-prepared party can face off without suffering any fatalities. At the same time, the power of an Adventurer fighting alone would be lower than a Demonic Beast of the same Rank.</p>

<p>In other words, if Adventurers of Rank E create a party of ~4-6 people, their combat potential will allow them to hunt a <em>single</em> Demonic Beast of Threat Level E. At the same time, every member of the party would be able to fight equally with Demonic Beasts of Rank F.</p>

<p>『Hmm~, one Goblin is G, 10 is F, and 100 is E, so…』</p>

<p>To Fran who defeated 100 Goblins singlehandedly, Rank D would be a bit low, wouldn’t it? Moreover, the Goblins had the environmental advantage of the forest, and even had a large number of Highbreeds mixed within their numbers. That should also raise the evaluation, even if only a little.</p>

<p>A Dwarven man who seems like the leader of the dispatch explains that to the group. Mh, mhh! It’s nice hearing Fran be praised! Praise her more!</p>

<p>However, it seems that Fran doesn’t care much for their evaluation. Interrupting the Dwarf, she places the body of a Hobgoblin in front of the group with a <em>*thud*</em>.</p>

<p>「This.」<br>
「This is… A Hobgoblin?」<br>
「There.」<br>
「Moreover, four of them?」<br>
「They’re already at stage where Hobgoblins are leaving the den…?!」</p>

<p>This situation seems to quite last-minute. If left alone, chances are a Goblin invasion will occur in less than 10 days.</p>

<p>「Oops, sorry. I’ve forgotten self-introductions. The name’s Herbent. I’m a D Rank Adventurer from Aressa. What’s your name, lass?」<br>
「Fran.」<br>
「Are you on a journey? Thanks for stopping the Goblins here.」<br>
「? Adventurer from Aressa too.」<br>
「Muh? No, I’ve been in Aressa for over 10 years, but I have no memory of seeing you, lass……」</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>It would be hard to miss the expressionless Fran who’s small, beautiful, and strong besides. The 3 men who seem to be party members of Herbent nod as well. Another party, this one consisting of Beastmen, show a similar reaction.</p>

<p>「Registered yesterday.」<br>
「Ha?」<br>
「No way! What Rank are you, then?」<br>
「G.」<br>
「<em>Haaa?</em> You’re this strong yet you’re Rank G? What kind of joke is that?!」<br>
「No, strength and Rank don’t always match up. For example, Elves can train for many years in the woods. If they come out to the rest of the world and register as an Adventurer, they’d be Rank G even though their power would match Rank D.」<br>
「I-I see.」<br>
「That’s right, isn’t it~」<br>
「Ahh, we were in the wrong for doubting you, Fran!」</p>

<p>Aah, it ended up like this after all. For long-lived races, young aged appearances mean nothing. The setting of having several years of experience would be far easier to understand than the truth.</p>

<p>『These guys are making a big misunderstanding all on their own, is it alright not to correct them? Surely they’re thinking that Fran looks young but is actually a middle-aged woman.』<br>
（Different.）</p>

<p>She seems so uninterested in their evaluation that it’s refreshing. Regrettable. I wanted to see these guys’ surprised faces when the truth was revealed. Well, it would be troublesome to explain, so it’s fine.</p>

<p>「A-Anyways, we have to find the Queen’s Den before the situation gets out of hand. We should return to the Guild at once!」<br>
「Yeah. It’s selfish, but I’d like the young lass to come with us as well.」<br>
「Understood.」<br>
「That takes a load off our shoulders. Alright, let’s head back! It’s a race against time!」<br>
「Ou!」</p>

<pre>Name ：Fran 　Age ：12 
Race ：Black Cat Beastman 
Job ：Magic Swordsman 
State ：Contracted 

Status:
Level ：6→12 
HP ：80→189　MP ：71→115　 
STR ：45→92　END ：34→74　AGI ：46→82 
INT ：30→50　MGC ：36→62　DEX ：47→63 

Titles:
King of Dismantling, Master of Recovery, Skill Collector, Master of Fire, King of Cooking 
〈New〉Match for a Thousand, Goblin Slayer, One who Slaughters</pre>

<p>Fran’s Status looks like this. The increase in Status is extremely good. Furthermore, she gained three more Titles!</p>

<pre><strong>Match for a Thousand:</strong> 
A Title awarded to individuals who stood their ground against 100 or more opponents on equal footing alone, and lived to tell the tale. 

Effects: 
HP +20, STR +20, END + 20
The Skill: Indomitable Resolve will be acquired.</pre>

<pre><strong>Goblin Slayer:</strong> 
A Title awarded to individuals who fell 100 or more Goblins on the same battlefield. 

Effect:
The Skill: Goblin Slayer will be acquired.</pre>

<pre><strong>One who Slaughters:</strong>
A Title awarded to individuals who harvested the lives of 100 individuals on the same battlefield. 

Effects:
AGI +10
The Skill: Mental Stability will be acquired.</pre>

<p>For the Skills:</p>

<pre><strong>Indomitable Resolve:</strong>
In adverse circumstances:
     Fear is invalidated
     Recovery Speed ↑ High</pre>

<pre><strong>Goblin Slayer</strong>:
Damage against Goblins ↑</pre>

<pre><strong>Mental Stability:
</strong>Mental hurdle against bloodshed ↓
Stabilizing effect on the user's mind</pre>

<p>They’re good Titles. I want them too, but because I’m a sword, I don’t seem to be able to obtain any Titles. Anyways, Match for a Thousand is amazing. The conditions for acquiring it are difficult, but isn’t it a slight cheat? Its Effects, that is.</p>

<p>I noticed something important, too. The Skills that Fran obtained independently aren’t included with my Set Skills.</p>

<p>Because of this, if Fran obtains useful Skills on her own, I can change my Set Skills in more useful ways.</p>

<p>While we head towards town with the Adventurers, I tell Fran about her Status.</p>

<p>（Match for a Thousand? Rare.）<br>
『Is that so?』<br>
（Hero’s Titles!）</p>

<p>Fran shows slight excitement. I’m glad.</p>

<p>「Hey, have you not joined a Party yet, lass?」<br>
「Party?」<br>
「Ou. If you haven’t, why not join ours?」</p>

<p>Herbent is soliciting us into his party, huh. Moreover, his eyes show that he’s completely serious. Hearing what he said, the other two parties also raised their voices.</p>

<p>「– Wait just a minute, you’re not the only one aiming for that!」<br>
「Don’t try to steal the lead. Any Party would want such an excellent Adventurer among them.」</p>

<p>This is somewhat pleasant, hearing that Fran was accepted by the Adventurers</p>

<p>『Well? What shall you do?』<br>
（My Party: Teacher）<br>
『It’s possible to hide my identity even if you join other parties, you know?』<br>
（It’s alright. Teacher: here.）<br>
『Is that so…』</p>

<p>Well, we can’t afford for my abilities to be seen, so it would be difficult to join a party.</p>

<p>For now, at least.</p>

                    <br>

        <h1>Chapter 30: Ranking Up</h1>

<p>Author’s Note:<br>
We’re at 30 chapters now. This is all thanks to the support of everyone;<br>
it’s my main motivation!</p>

<p>In addition, I changed the Status view in Chapter 29 because it was difficult to see the improvements. I also revised her HP, because a value of 20 is Low, so it now looks like the following:</p>

<p>Status　Level：6→12<br>
HP：80→189　MP：71→115<br>
STR：45→92　END：34→74 AGI：46→82<br>
INT：30→50　MGC：36→62 DEX：47→63</p>

<hr>
<p>After the incident with the Goblins, we rushed back to Aressa and finally arrived. I had wanted to repair Fran’s protective gear, but it seems like it’ll have to wait until after we finish business at the Guild.</p>

<p>I removed dirt and stains from the gear with Purification Magic as an act of etiquette, but its severely damaged appearance hasn’t changed. None of the Adventurers nearby seem to mind it, however.</p>

<p>「Herbent, how was it?」<br>
「Ou. We need to report to the Guild Master.」<br>
「I’ll notify him, please wait a moment.」</p>

<p>Seeing the serious face of Herbent, the fact that the situation is dire was clear. Nell rushes towards the back in a hurry.</p>

<p>Several minutes later, Nell comes back and calls for Fran and the dispatch.</p>

<p>「The Guild Master sent for you. This way.」</p>

<p>When we entered the Guild Master’s office, both he and Donna were present.</p>

<p>「Let’s hear the report.」<br>
「Aah. We headed to the scene with Kral, which is where we met Fran.」<br>
「At that point the battle was already over.」<br>
「I see. Then I’d like request that Fran……」</p>

<p>The Guild Master sighs lightly — likely because he understands Fran’s taciturn nature. 『How should I have her talk?』is the face he’s making. Well, should I lend my suppor here? It seems to be quite the urgent situation, after all.</p>

<p>「Can you report what happened?」<br>
『Fran, take out the Horns.』<br>
「Nn. This.」</p>

<p>Fran takes a Hobgoblin Horn out of Dimensional Storage, and brings it out of dummy bag.</p>

<p>「This is…… A Hobgoblin Horn?」</p>

<p>When the Guild Master understands what it is through Appraisal, he makes a stern expression.</p>

<p>「Mixed among the Goblins there were Hobgoblins?! How many Goblins were there? And how many Hobgoblins as well?」</p>

<p>Donna picks up the horn and becomes astonished as well.</p>

<p>「A lot.」<br>
「Er… In a bit more detail, please.」<br>
『There were around 130 of them.』<br>
「Around 130.」<br>
『Within them were 4 Hobgoblins, and around 20 Highbreeds.』<br>
「Hobgoblins: 4, Highbreeds: around 20.」<br>
「Impossible!」</p>

<p>Donna stands up unintentionally.</p>

<p>「This is definitely a sign that a Goblin stampede is coming!」<br>
「Calm down Donna.」<br>
「E-Excuse me.」<br>
「Now then, Fran, a question. What happened to the Goblins? Did you withdraw?」<br>
「Defeated them.」<br>
「So you didn’t withdraw, then.」<br>
「Nn. Fought to the end.」<br>
「This is bad.」</p>

<p>What’s bad?</p>

<p>The Guild Master explains that the Goblins Fran defeated were most likely the ones kicked out of the den when there were too many mouths to feed. As breeding was continually ordered by the King, the low-class Goblins would no longer be able to match up to their children, so they were sent to battle Fran with the resolution to die.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the fact that there were Hobgoblins and Highbreeds mixed among them could only mean that the den already consists of purely Hobgoblins.</p>

<p>「The scale of the Goblin stampede will be large.」<br>
「We should put an emergency summon out to the Adventurers immediately.」<br>
「We’ll prepare today and tomorrow, and attempt to exterminate the den the day after. Will it be that sort of plan?」<br>
「Yeah. The first step would be getting Adventurers with Thief-like Jobs locate the den. That should be made into a special request.」<br>
「I’ll secure some Potions.」</p>

<p>It’s become quite busy. Receptionists (excluding Nell who was already present) were called in and given various instructions.</p>

<p>「Now then, Herbent. I’d like to assign more work to you, is that alright?」<br>
「Is it guidance to the battleground?」<br>
「It is. I’d like you to return there with Thief Adventurers.」<br>
「Got it. This situation is serious for all of Aressa, so I’ll do everything I can.」</p>

<p>At the words of Herbent, the other Adventurers nod vigorously a well. They seem like they want to stick with Fran as well, but I won’t permit it.</p>

<p>We have to repair her protective gear, and after that she needs time to rest. I won’t concede on that.</p>

<p>「Fran…… Please take a rest for today. Asking you to work with your protective gear would be unreasonable.」<br>
「…… Nn.」</p>

<p>Fran nods regretfully. Guild Master, good job!</p>

<p>Herbert gives his affirmation, too.</p>

<p>「Then.」<br>
「Aah, wait a minute. Before you leave, go by the Receptionists and apply to rank up to F.」<br>
「? Haven’t completed 5 requests.」<br>
「There’s no reason for an Adventurer who could take out an army of Goblins alone to do that. There’s also the fact that G Ranks won’t be able to join this subjugation, so the timing’ll be convenient.」<br>
「<em>Gahahaha!</em> Even just one more strong Adventurer’d be better at this point!」<br>
「It’s a pretty last-minute request, so we don’t know how many Adventurers will be participating. Considering that, anyone with combat potential is valuable.」<br>
「The request to participate in the subjugation should be posted tomorrow, so be sure to accept it!」<br>
「Nn. Make sure.」<br>
「We’re saved.」<br>
「Then…」</p>

<p>Following the words of the Guild Master, we do the Rank Up procedure at the reception desk. It was simple, so there weren’t any particular problems. The time taken would be less than a minute, too. After completing it, the letter F appeared on our Guild Card.</p>

<p>「Went up!」</p>

<p>She seems happy. The evaluations of others doesn’t matter, but when the Rank actually raises visibly she takes interest, it seems. It’s just like Levels. Well, it’s a measure of her strength, after all.</p>

<p>『Alright, our participation is assured. Now, we should go repair your gear. Will the money we have on-hand suffice, I wonder?』<br>
「Sell weapons.」<br>
『To the Guild?』</p>

<p>When we inquired about it, we received the reply that the Guild didn’t purchase anything other than Materials and things like Herbs.</p>

<p>『Well, let’s take them to Gallus then.』</p>

<p>The problem is whether a skilled Blacksmith like Gallus would be willing to take in such bad weapons or not…</p>

<p>『No, wait. There’s still one other person, a Merchant we’re acquainted with!』<br>
「 ? 」<br>
『Oi, oi… Well, his presence was thin, so I suppose it can’t be helped. It’s Randell.』<br>
「Aah.」</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>Stop with the「There was a person like that, wasn’t there…」reaction… Well, I don’t really know him that well either.</p>

<p>『He had said that he’s located along the Western side of main street, I think.』<br>
「Search.」</p>

<p>◇◆◇</p>

<p>I was worried about whether we’d be able to find Randell’s shop in a big town like Aressa, but it was found quite quickly; it was right near the entrance to the street. Randell can be seen standing out front.</p>

<p>「Oh, if it isn’t Fran! By any chance, were you looking for my shop?」<br>
「Nn. Came to sell.」<br>
「Wonderful! Come, come, right this way.」</p>

<p>And so Randell invites us into his shop.</p>

<p>『It’s very disorderly, isn’t it…』</p>

<p>In the small shop, the shelves are crammed with products. Honey and poison are lined side by side, weapons are neighbors to miscellaneous goods… But it’s not consistently like that.</p>

<p>「Dirty.」<br>
『Oou… Even though I was going out of my way to be silent about, you went right out and said it!』</p>

<p>When I look over to Randell, I see a wry smile plastered across his face.</p>

<p>「<em>Haha…</em> You said it well. Even though I just organize them by what seems to sell…」</p>

<p>Even so, aren’t there a bit too many products? Well, it’s not my place to say so, so I keep that to myself. For the average person, this place would be hard to approach, however.</p>

<p>「This: buy.」<br>
「<em>Uwa…</em> You had an Item Bag, huh!」<br>
「More or less.」</p>

<p>Equipment is taken out one after another, some of which draw Randell’s attention.</p>

<p>「Still, this is……! What an amazing amount!」<br>
「Still more. About the same.」<br>
「Ehh? Wait a minute. I’m sorry about this, but could you display them on the floor?」<br>
「Understood.」<br>
「It must be pretty high-quality to store so much… Mine’s pretty small and hard to use, so I’m a bit envious.」</p>

<p>Just like a pro, he makes small talk while assessing the arms. His eyes are sharp; it’s the face of a merchant.</p>

<p>「Hmm, most of them aren’t in good condition.」<br>
「From Goblins.」<br>
「Aah, so that’s where you got them. Some are made from Steel, so they’d be worth a little more…… It’d be about 13,000 Gorudo total, I suppose?」<br>
（Alright?）<br>
『They’re worth about 200 Gorudo on average, huh…… Looking at their state, it seems like it’d be a good price?』<br>
「Understood. That’s fine.」</p>

<p>Randell takes out some coins from what must be is Item Bag.</p>

<p>「Here you go then.」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>All of the money was tucked away in Dimensional Storage. Because they’re easy to take out, it makes a good substitute for a wallet.</p>

<p>「Thank you very much. And please, come again.」</p>

<p>There’re a lot of interesting products, so we’ll probably come again. At that time, let’s buy something.</p>

<p>With money in hand, we head to old man Gallus’ shop. Merchants are assembled around the square as always, so we enter from the back door we used the other day.</p>

<p>「Helloー.」<br>
「Ooh, it’s you! What happened? The Sheath isn’t done yet.」<br>
「Nn, different.」<br>
『I’d like you to repair the Equipment you sold earlier……』</p>

<p>Showing him the protective gear「W-What the hell–?!」was his reaction.</p>

<p>「Wait a minute, it’s only been a day…… What in the world happened?」<br>
「Fought Goblins.」<br>
「Goblins?」<br>
『To be exact: a large army of Goblins numbering over 100.』<br>
「Hobgoblins, too.」<br>
「<em>Haa?</em> Isn’t that really serious?! A stampede’s going to occur!」<br>
『It’s already been reported to the Adventurer’s Guild.』<br>
「<em>Ah</em>, is that so. Well, that’s fine then.」<br>
「Teacher: benevolent.」<br>
「Teacher?」<br>
『That would be my name.』</p>

<p>That reminds me, I didn’t tell Gallus my name, did I? But I have a bad premonition…</p>

<p>「<em>Haa?</em> Why such a strange –」<br>
『Isn’t it such a good name? Fran thought of it!』</p>

<p>Notice, Gallus!</p>

<p>「O-Ooh. It’s… A good name. Really.」<br>
『Right? Isn’t that right?』<br>
「It’s the best name! It’s an excellent name for a sword!」</p>

<p><em>Pheーw…</em> That was close. Gallus continues praising my name while looking over at Fran frequently. … It’s unnatural.</p>

<p>「T-That reminds me, you came to get your gear fixed, right?」<br>
『That’s right! Can it be fixed? We have to go assist in the Goblin subjugation the day after tomorrow.』<br>
「No problem. Repairs can be finished immediately.」<br>
「Cost?」<br>
「Right…… 10,000 Gorudo.」<br>
『That’s quite cheap.』<br>
「Well, that’s the price of the Magic Crystal.」<br>
『Magic Crystal?』<br>
「Yeah, unlike Magic Stones, Magic Crystals are a mined from the ground. After storing enough magic power they can be used as catalysts.」<br>
『This is the first time I’ve heard of it.』<br>
「It’s not needed for regular repairs, but it’s necessary to use one for Smithing Magic.」<br>
『Then you’ll be repairing the gear through Magic?』<br>
「Ou. Want to watch?」<br>
『Is that alright?』</p>

<p>In the end I decide to take up old man Gallus’ offer, and watch him repair Fran’s gear.</p>

<p>First he places the gear on top of a workbench with a Magic formation drawn on it, then he puts a yellow Magic Crystal onto a what seems to be a pedestal.</p>

<p>After that, he proceeds to cast a spell with a long chant.</p>

<p>「– Repair!」</p>

<p>With the sound of Gallus’ voice, the magic formation shines bright. Once the light is completely settled, protective gear that seems as though it’s brand new is all that’s left on the workbench.</p>

<p>「Amazing.」<br>
『Aah. They’re as good as new.』<br>
「It’s pretty convenient for stuff like this, but its effect falls when it’s used on gear too many times. I got off with a small Magic Crystal this time, but next time I’ll have to use one a bit bigger. The fee’ll be 30,000 when that happens.」</p>

<p>If that’s the case, it might be cheaper to buy a new set later… I’ll make sure to consider that when the time comes.</p>

<p>「Thank you.」<br>
「No problem. I’ve got to do well so that you can do your best fighting against Hobgoblins!」<br>
「Leave it to me.」<br>
『We’ll defeat both the King and the Queen!』<br>
「Nn. Our prey.」<br>
「<em>Hahahaha!</em> How reliable!」</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 31: Organization and Verification</h1>

<p>It’s now the night of the day we exterminated the army of Goblins.</p>

<p>We’re at an inn.</p>

<p>『Now then, shall I review my new Skills?』</p>

<p>Fran already left to take a bath, so I figure I should confirm my Skills to kill some time.</p>

<p>By the way, this inn isn’t the same one we stayed at yesterday. We moved to a slightly better inn recommended by the Guild. It has the expensive fee of 600 Gorudo per night, but there’s a large Bathhouse and the food they offer is of higher quality and quantity.</p>

<p>I mentioned it before, but the new Skills are like this:</p>

<p>Chant Shortening, Acrobatics, Retainer’s Contract, Kicking Techniques, Kicking Arts, Ghost Magic, Poison Absorption, Poison Magic, Axe Techniques, Imperturbability</p>

<p>Because I unfortunately can’t use Kicking Techniques, Kicking Arts, and Axe Techniques, I’ll exclude them. Also, because Imperturbability seems to have the effect of calming its user down in battle, I can’t try it here.</p>

<p>And so, first is Acrobatics. It grants a bonus to both jumping and balancing, it seems. I tested it out by flying about in the room, but it doesn’t have much of an effect on me. Regrettable. I think it’d be a suitable Skill for Fran.</p>

<p>Now for a show-stopper. It’s time for the inspection of new Magic.</p>

<p>First: Poison Magic. For the spells I can use, they’re Poison・Arrow and Create・Poison. Well, because it’s only Lv1 they only have the effects of a weak poison, so they don’t seem like they’ll have much of an effect against strong opponents. Even if it was used on ordinary people its effect would only be to the extent of loosening their bowels.</p>

<p>I test out Poison Absorption by sucking in some poison I created with magic, but I don’t understand it very well. It seems that it’d restore HP and MP, but because I have neither there’s no effect. Poison Absorption would be useful in environments with poisonous fogs, however. I could play an active part as a sword with air purification capabilities.</p>

<p>Next is Chant Shortening. Its effects are hardly visible at Lv1 — it probably shortens the chant by ~1 second, I think? Even in a drawn out battle its impact would be low. Furthermore, I have the feeling that its effect won’t be that amazing even if I raise its Skill Level.</p>

<p>Out of the remaining Skills, my favorite is Ghost Magic, so I’ll save it for last.</p>

<p>The other remaining Skill is Retainer’s Contract. It seems to make a specialized contract with Contract Magic in order to summon individuals with Summon Kin, but… Because the level of Summon Kin is low I can’t summon anything strong even if they’re contracted. I could summon weak ones, but if they’re weak then there’s no point in using it in the first place.</p>

<p>『Now for Ghost Magic.』</p>

<p>Incidentally, despite being called Ghost Magic spells at Lv1 are Create・Lesser Zombie and Locate・Undead, these two.</p>

<p>For the time being, I take out a Goblin’s corpse. Making a barrier using Purification Magic, blood doesn’t dirty the floor. My forethought is flawless.</p>

<p>『– Create・Lesser Zombie!』<br>
「<em><strong>Aaao</strong>oouaaa…</em>」<br>
『<em>Uwaa……</em>』</p>

<p>Even though I’m the one who made it, it’s still unpleasant! Does its decomposition advance before it becomes a Zombie or something? It’s good that I don’t have a nose… I understand the feelings of Kri**in well.</p>

<p>『Wait there.』<br>
「<em>Auu…</em>」<br>
『Did you hear my command?』</p>

<p>I have to pay careful attention here. All it’s doing is swaying in place, but still.</p>

<p>Next, I use Locate・Undead. Similar to Presence Perception, I was able to feel the presence of the Zombie.</p>

<p>Well, now I’ve tried out both spells, but…… What do I do with this guy, exactly?</p>

<p>Ah, speaking of which, what’s the status of Summon Kin? <em>Uwa…</em> Lesser Goblin Zombie is listed. Can’t I delete this?</p>

<p>『…… I’m sorry.』<br>
「<em>Aa–</em>」</p>

<p>I gave a brief apology and cut down the Zombie. I don’t know if Zombies from Dungeons are the same, but this Zombie doesn’t have a Magic Stone.</p>

<p>To the Zombie who’s no longer moving, I use Purification Magic’s Turn・Undead, causing it to disappear. The Zombie also disappeared from the list of contracted beings in Summon Kin.</p>

</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>『Un, rest in peace.』</p>

<p>From now on, let’s not use Ghost Magic recklessly. I’ll make sure your death wasn’t in vain, Goblin Zombie! Ah, wait, it was already dead.</p>

<p>『…… Let’s pull ourselves together and move on.』</p>

<p>Next I’ll check the Magic Items we looted from the Goblins.</p>

<p>『There’re 7. I wonder what effects they’ll have…』</p>

<p>Two of the items are weapons. Specifically, they’re a Knife and a Hammer, both made of steel. Neither have things like ATK ↑ Low, but the Knife looks like it’d be useful for skinning. As for the Hammer, I’ll let it sit in Dimensional Storage for a while.</p>

<p>One of the Magic Items is an accessory. It has the subtle effect of lowering INT while raising STR.</p>

<p>『STR+5, INT-8…… This is the sort of item a musclebrain would use, isn’t it?』</p>

<p>Fran won’t be needing it. She uses Magic, so it would really only be considered if the increase and decrease were equal.</p>

<p>The next three are defensive gear. There’s Iron Armor with rust prevention, Leather Armor with size adjustment, and a Helmet made out of materials from a Magic Tree with Impact Resistance.</p>

<p>Because their DEF attributes are so low, aren’t they simply unneeded? The gear we received from old man Gallus offers much higher performance.</p>

<p>The last one is an Item Bag… But it can’t be used.</p>

<p>『Wasn’t there something like a User Registration for these?』</p>

<p>I suppose it’d be similar to Equipment Registration. The Goblins had used it as an accessory case for storing stones and nuts to use Throwing with.</p>

<p>『Perhaps I can override the registration…… Maybe Contract Magic’ll work?』</p>

<p>Might as well try it out.</p>

<p>『–Contract!』</p>

<p>It was no good. It was the same feeling as when I tried to override Fran’s Slave Contract. Overwriting <em>is</em> possible, but Lv7 is just too low to do so.</p>

<p>『Hmm… To find out what’s in the bag, let’s raise the Skill~』</p>

<p>Such a thing will be put on hold for a while.</p>

<p>『The remaining money is……』</p>

<p>Today’s earnings come to 109 Goblin Horns, and 20 Highbreed Horns. By the way, one Highbreed Horn is 100 Gorudo.</p>

<p>The completion of the Herb Harvesting request also granted 100 Gorudo.</p>

<p>Because I handed 10,000 Gorudo to Fran, I have exactly 36,884 Gorudo stored up.</p>

<p>『Should I buy Mana Potions for the day after tomorrow? It doesn’t seem like it’d be a waste to do so.』</p>

<p>Rather, will that be enough?</p>

<p>『There’re still a lot of enigmatic materials stored away from Harvesting, too…』</p>

<p>I should sort this stuff out.</p>

<p>10 Poisonous Grasses, 10 Light Mushrooms, 10 Paralysis-Cure Grass, 10 Highly Poisonous Grasses, and 10 Heal Grasses. Because each Harvesting Request requires 5 of each, we can complete 10 requests. However, because we ranked up to Rank F faster than expected, we won’t be able to improve our Rank with G Rank requests anymore.</p>

<p>The only Harvesting request of Rank F is for 5 Highly Poisonous Grasses, so if we hand in the ones we have we’ll still need to complete the request another 18 times.</p>

<p>Because Dungeons are restricted by Rank, I want to raise our Rank just a bit more.</p>

<p>Anyways, there’re still 30 mysteriously hazardous substances. Most are low-level, but there’re 2 Mushrooms that seem quite dangerous. They set off a large reaction to Danger Perception, and even their appearance spells danger. They’re blue umbrella-like mushrooms with white and red spots — no matter how you look at them, they’re Toadstools.</p>

<p>『Only these mushrooms will be kept in reserve. We should take them over to Randell’s shop later.』</p>

<p>I’s like to collect information on Hobgoblins in advance, so tomorrow will be quite busy.</p>

<hr>
<p> 腹を下す. I thought that it might be “Upset stomach”, but it really is just as I translated it.<br>
In my opinion, poisons like this one are still pretty convenient in certain situations.</p>

<p> Reference to Krillin from DBZ. クリ〇ン = クリリン</p>

<p> Not sure if this is referring to the two Mushrooms, or the other ones. あとは、ランデルの店にでも持って行ってみるか<br>
My guess is that it’s the Toadstools that’ll be sold to Randell, with the other things going to the Guild/wherever.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 32: Fran’s Side</h1>

<p>Author’s Note: Bookmarks now exceed 200.<br>
Thank you!</p>

<hr>
<p>「<em>Fu…… Ha……</em>」</p>

<p>Baths are the best. When I told teacher that I loved them, he was somewhat surprised. 『You’re a cat, though?』he said.</p>

<p>Do cats dislike baths? I’m from the Black Cat tribe, but I’ve never seen a cat before. Nobles in the capital seem to keep them. Mother had said that they live better lives than us.</p>

<p>I want to see one with Teacher sometime.</p>

<p>Teacher is a very wonderful sword. He’s the first sword I’ve talked to, but if he’s judged by his voice, he’d be similar to a Human I suppose.</p>

<p>He’s very strong. He made me strong, too. I won’t be outdone by a Demonic Beast. But as I am now is no good. I can’t constantly be managed by Teacher. I’ll become a burden to him.</p>

<p>Even for the Goblins we fought today, if Teacher fought alone not only would the fight have been easier, it would have ended quicker as well.</p>

<p>Mastering the powers I got from Teacher should be my first priority. After that, I’ll become even stronger. Training like that, I think I’ll surely be able to break through the Wall.</p>

<p>And so, today I spoke a bit selfishly and fought against the Goblins. Teacher scolded me at first, but then he forgave and even praised me.</p>

<p>I was very glad. I’ll be fighting the day after tomorrow, too. It’s another chance to become stronger.</p>

<p>「Oh, Fran?」<br>
「Nn?」<br>
「We met at noon. Because the Guild is allied with this Inn, all members of the Guild staff can use the bathhouse.」</p>

<p><em>Aah</em>, this person is one of the receptionists.</p>

<p>「Are you staying here?」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「<em>Aーah</em>, still cute as ever, huh~」<br>
「 ? 」<br>
「Kyaー your head tilt rally is the best!」</p>

<p>When she was working, she was giving off a much quieter feeling. Was she hiding her true nature?</p>

<p>「Hey, is calling you Fran-chan no good?」<br>
「Don’t mind.」<br>
「Thank you very much! Fran-chan!」</p>

<p>All of a sudden she clung to me. I don’t mind, but it was a bit surprising. Her chest made a slight <em>*funii*</em> and it’s comfortable, so I’ll permit it.</p>

<p>「The big subjugation war will be happening tomorrow, huh.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「Did you hear the announcement?」<br>
「 ? 」<br>
「It seems that you haven’t. Apparently the Goblins seem to be overflowing from a dungeon of some sort.」<br>
「Dungeon nearby?」</p>

<p>Dungeons are naturally famous once they’re discovered, but I’ve never heard of one being near Aressa.</p>

<p>「It seems to have appeared only recently… Up until now there was only a cave there.」<br>
「Dungeons can be built that quickly?」<br>
「Mhm. That’s right.」<br>
「 ? 」<br>
「<em>Ahh</em>, you don’t know? As a trial of sorts against mankind, the God of Chaos makes them appear in various places every so often.」<br>
「Didn’t know. God of Chaos and Evil God: different?」<br>
「My, you don’t know that either, huh. Your elder sister here’ll explain it all to you.」</p>

<p>And so, the receptionist explained the legends.</p>

<p>「To put it simply, this world has 88 Gods. Among them, there were 10 that were especially strong.」</p>

<p>First, the God of the Sun, the God of the Moon, the God of the Sea, the God of the Land, the God of Flames, the God of Storms, the God of Forests, and the God of Beasts created the world and all its inhabitants.<br>
The God of Hades created the Ring of Samsara, and the laws of the world were made.<br>
The 78 Children Gods made various materials, and brought them to the world the Parent Gods had made, thus making the world larger.</p>

<p>「Children Gods?」<br>
「That’s right. The God of Blacksmithing, God of Swords, God of Darkness and God of Cooking are good examples of those.」</p>

<p>Finally, the God of Chaos did as its name suggested, and spread chaos into the world. But it was a necessary evil to prevent the stagnation of the world… Or so the receptionist says. Its job seems like quite the challenge.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">

        </div>
        

<p>I understood it well. Surpassing adversity leads to growth. Fighting against the Goblins, I was able to grow.</p>

<p>「And the Evil God?」<br>
「Originally, the Evil God was the God of War. But after indulging itself too much in its power and attempting to rule the world, the other Gods struck it down. It’s said that evil beings are born due to its excessive grudge — through a curse that it scattered across the lands.」<br>
「I see.」</p>

<p>So, in the end, the God of Chaos is good. The Evil God is bad. He’s like the Slave Traders that kidnapped me.</p>

<p>「Anyways, as I said: Dungeons are one of the trials that the God of Chaos created. Dungeon Masters are followers of the God of Chaos, and actively create chaos because of it.」</p>

<p>Dungeon Master… Would they have any Magic Stones for Teacher to eat? They’re sure o have a lot of great Skills.</p>

<p>「It’s still being researched, but it seems that the first thing done in creating a dungeon is the creation of its core. The creature that is closest to the Core when its created becomes the Dungeon Master.」<br>
「Weak and strong ones, then.」<br>
「Yep. The difficulty of the Dungeon depends on the strength of the Dungeon Master, so when an animal ends up being the Dungeon Master its difficulty tends to be lower.」<br>
「Strange Dungeon Masters too?」<br>
「Dragons, Orcs, Wolves, Cockatrices… So long as they emit a life force, they can be a Dungeon Master.」<br>
「People?」<br>
「Of course. Human Dungeon Masters have popped up several times in the past.」</p>

<p>Man-made Dungeons… Interesting.</p>

<p>「Well… Even if it’s called a trial from God, it isn’t any less troublesome.」</p>

<p>Because people will end up dying, that can’t be helped. The people looking for a fight like me are the minority.</p>

<p>「In the case of rare Demonic Beasts inhabiting a Dungeon, however, it can be used to make a living as an Adventurer.」</p>

<p>Dungeons aren’t purely bad things. There are people who can become rich because of them.</p>

<p>「There’re Treasure Chests, strong weapons, and magical items too.」</p>

<p>There’s a legend of a Hero who defeated an Evil Dragon with a weapon found in a dungeon; he later went on to found a country. But because I have Teacher, things like that aren’t necessary.</p>

<p>「But in the end, some items from Dungeons are too strong〜 They can be used in wars to cause just as much harm as good, don’t you think〜?」</p>

<p>In the end, the conversation shifted to the complaints of the receptionist.</p>

<p>I don’t hate the God of Chaos for letting me get stronger in Dungeons.</p>

<p>「Day after tomorrow: looking forward to it.」</p>

<hr>
<p> Fran made a pun here. Essentially, she used “Neko” as the start of what would have essentially translated to “Wolf in sheep’s clothing/hiding one’s true self” — or in this case, the closest would be “hiding one’s true cat”. She then followed up with “She’s a human, though.” It doesn’t translate over very well (as in at all), so I edited the line. The pun disappeared, but that can’t be helped.</p>

<p> The receptionist (and many other people, such as the Adventurer parties up until this point) have used -san up until this point. -chan is more familiar, if you didn’t know.</p>

<p> Regarding the Gods’ names:</p>

<ul>
	<li>“God of the Silver Moon” (銀月の神) was kept as just “Moon”, but I’ll change it if it turns out there’s more than just a single moon (and other Gods of other moons, respectively).</li>
	<li>“God of Storms” = “God of wind and rain” (風雨の神)</li>
	<li>“God of Beasts” = “God of animals and insects” (獣蟲の神が)</li>
	<li>“God of Hades” = Literally “God of Hades” or “God of the realm of the dead” (冥界の神が).</li>
</ul>

<p> Samsara = Endless cycle of death and rebirth. Buddhism, I think.</p>

                    <br>

<p><code>Ensig:</code><br>
Slowly getting back into the groove of things. <em>Slowly</em>.</p>

<p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p>Author’s Note:<br>
We’ve reached 59th place of the daily rankings before I knew it!<br>
Getting within the top 300 was my original goal……<br>
So this is thanks to everyone’s support!</p>

<p>Let’s aim for the top 50s next!<br>
Or rather, I’ll do my best to keep the story from suddenly becoming dull!</p>

<hr>
<p>It’s the day of the Hobgoblin subjugation.</p>

<p>We ended up going over to old man Gallus’ smithy in order to receive the sheath we ordered.</p>

<p>「Hey, I’ve been waiting. Come and take a look!」<br>
『Ooh, this is my sheath, huh!』</p>

<p>Handed over from old man Gallus was a stylish black leather scabbard. It’s a bit plain, but because the tailoring is good it doesn’t look too shabby.</p>

<p>「Nn, Teacher.」<br>
『Mhm. Then, right away……』</p>

<p>I’m excitedly sheathed into the scabbard as Fran raises the scabbard up to just below my eye-level.</p>

<p><em>*supo*</em></p>

<p>『<em>Oーh……</em>』</p>

<p>It’s very calming. It’s roughly the same feeling I got when I fit into the pedestal. Rather, it might have been that the pedestal was designed to be sheath-like to give me peace of mind.</p>

<p>『<em>Aーhh……</em>』</p>

<p>I let out a voice as if I’m in paradise — the kind that one would let out when they take a dip in a hot bath. This really is good… I didn’t know that swords would have such a strong desire to be sheathed, even though I am one.</p>

<p>Moreover, thanks to the skill of old man Gallus it’s a perfect fit. It’s like I’m tucked into my own personal futon, giving me peace of mind. If it’s like this, then I want to be in a sheath all the time… It’s just that relaxing.</p>

<p>『Old man Gallus. You’re the best. Seriously.』<br>
「<em>Gahaha!</em> It’s good that you like it!」<br>
「Teacher, happy.」<br>
『Yeah, this is a great sheath~』<br>
「It’s not just a regular sheath, you know?」</p>

<p>Gallus had an impish smile on his face as he took the sheath in his hand.</p>

<p>「Rather than just making some dull old scabbard, I installed a couple of tricks, you see.」<br>
『What?! Is that true, Lon**rk?!』<br>
「Lon**rk? Who’s that?」<br>
『Ah, excuse me. I was a bit too excited.』</p>

<p>Still, there’re tricks in the sheath? Looking at it, I don’t see anything…</p>

<p>「See these metal fittings here?」<br>
「Mhm.」<br>
「Well, when you remove them like this –」</p>

<p><em>*paka*</em></p>

<p>「Opens lengthwise.」<br>
「Ou. Even without using the young miss’ hands, you’ll easily be able to get out of the sheath by using Telekinesis.」<br>
『Hmm? That’s pretty good. It’d also make it easy to get back into the sheath.』</p>

<p>Controlling the metal fittings using Telekinesis, moving in and out of the sheath can be accomplished in no time.</p>

<p>「Convenient.」<br>
「Right? It was a bit tough to find a good way to implement it while keeping its strength, you know?」</p>

<p>Even though he’s a Blacksmith, his leatherworking is first class. As expected from someone with Blacksmithing at the highest level possible.</p>

<p>『Then, may I gratefully accept?』<br>
「<em>Ou.</em> Go for it.」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>Now to go to the meeting place. It seems that everyone who’ll be participating in the subjugation will be gathered in front of the gate. Because the Goblins haven’t started pouring out of the Dungeon just yet, it seems like it’ll be possible to exterminate them without causing any damage to the surroundings.</p>

<p>『I wonder how much damage we’ll be able to do with this many Adventurers…』</p>

<p>There’re about 50 people gathered.</p>

<p>「Not very strong.」<br>
『Donna is the strongest, it seems.』</p>

<p>Donna is Rank C, and is famous as an instructor who trains beginners. There’re other Adventurers of Rank C gathered, but there didn’t seem to be any objections with Donna being the leader.</p>

<p>「Oi, what’s a child doing here?!」</p>

<p>For Fran, however, there seems to be an objection. Well, to a group of Adventurers with their tension rising by the second, having a young girl mix in would undoubtedly thin out the energy in the air, so of course there would be fellows who become irritated.</p>

<p>「What’re you even doing, carrying a sword around like that?」</p>

<p>The source of the voice in this case is — Aren’t you a child as well?! Well, that’s what I’m led to believe judging by the slender youth’s appearance. He’s wearing tidy, fully intact armor, so there’s a clear air of inexperience.</p>

<p>Because G Rank Adventurers shouldn’t be able to participate, he should be F Rank or above…… But he has the appearance of someone who wouldn’t even be able to beat a Goblin. His Status is a little higher than a Goblin’s, but it’s only a slight difference.</p>

<p>Maybe, rather than ranking up through combat, he did things like delivery quests and such, and was allowed to Rank up after doing nothing but baggage-carrying requests. With Sword Arts Lv1, he’s by far the weakest Adventurer I’ve seen so far. To call upon even people like this… There really must not be enough people.</p>

<p>「Exterminating Goblins.」<br>
「Hey, this is an important fight to defend Aressa. Children like you will only get in the way! Only Adventurers with ranks above F can participate anyways, so kids should just go home!」</p>

<p>He makes an unpleasant face as he says so. In response: Fran, who works at her own pace, casually ignores the young man and simply stands absentmindedly.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>「Hey, did you hear me?」<br>
「 ? 」<br>
「Tsk. Come on, this isn’t a playground for children. Go play Adventurer over there.」</p>

<p>Most likely, this young man is feeling anxious about the upcoming fight against the Hobgoblins. Well, there statuses will be far superior to his, no doubt. And so, after getting all worked up, his mind is in a strange place. Because of this, he’s started to quarrel with someone who should be his ally.</p>

<p>The reactions of the Adventurers around us vary. To the scene of young people making noise, some are amused, and some are indifferent and ignore the scene. From the side, the scene of children making noise must be quite out of place.</p>

<p>「Nn.」<br>
「Damn it, stop moving out of the way!」</p>

<p>Fran casually avoids the arms of the young man who lets out an irritated shout. Because he only seems to be getting angrier, shouldn’t someone stop him? So I thought, but the surrounding Adventurers don’t look like they’ll step in.</p>

<p>No, there were some who were going to intervene with a shout, but they were stopped by the other Adventurers.</p>

<p>「<em>Oi</em>, leave it alone!」<br>
「Why should I–」<br>
「That one is–」<br>
「The rumor is–」<br>
「Seriously–」</p>

<p>It seems that the tale of the Goblin subjugation from earlier spread throughout the Adventurers in the Guild. However, a guy who turns a deaf ear to the information circulating in the surroundings comes out. It’s here, an Adventurer that will scold the young lad is here!</p>

<p>「Oi, brats! You’ve been noisy for a while now, get it?! Because you’re in the way, get out of here! You can carry our luggage later!」<br>
「I-I’m not a baggage carrier! I’m a fully fledged F Rank Adventurer!」<br>
「As if! At best, you’re an F Rank Adventurer who’s fresh out of Rank G!」<br>
「Regardless, I’m Rank F; therefor, I have the qualifications to participate!」<br>
「Also Rank F.」<br>
「 ? 」</p>

<p>The youth, who looked down on Fran, shows a surprised look. It seems that the fact she’s an official Adventurer caught him off guard.</p>

<p>「<em>Gyahahahahaha!</em> You? An F Rank? If a small fry like you is F Rank, then I’m an A Rank!」</p>

<p>It seems that this guy knows his limits enough not to say S Rank.</p>

<p>「Oi, oi. Are those guys seriously F Rank? Adventurers Ranks sure are easy to advance, huh…」<br>
「Well, they’re just scavengers in the end.」<br>
「I registered just to link my experience in my last job, but it seems like I’ll have an easier time advancing than I thought!」</p>

<p>Are these guys former mercenaries? According to what I’ve heard, there was a war in a neighboring country that ended earlier than expected. Because of that, mercenaries sprung up in vast quantities.</p>

<p>Although, looking at their Status, they don’t amount to much. Even though it’s like that, how can they brag so much?</p>

<p>「<em>Heheheh.</em> You, don’t you have something good theーre?」<br>
「Ohh? That’s a pretty good sword…」<br>
「Hand it over for a little.」</p>

<p>They have sharp eyes to hone in on me. Well, any points they gained were lost when they put their hand forward, though. The deduction mainly came from their lack of risk management abilities.</p>

<p>The young man who was involved with Fran only a moment ago felt a sudden chill and jumped back with goosebumps. It was a wise reaction. He must have sensed the bloodlust that Fran’s giving off. In comparison, the mercenaries continue to reach their arms towards me with vulgar faces.</p>

<p>「<em>Nn–</em>」<br>
「You guys, that’s enough!」</p>

<p>Right before Fran makes her move, Donna steps in between her and the mercenaries… And scolds them.</p>

<p>「Seriously, you damn fools! Don’t cause an unnecessary uproar right before we head out!」<br>
「No, we weren’t……」</p>

<p>As expected, they’re still able to sense the overpowering sense of intimidation given off by Donna. Their faces became stiff.</p>

<p>「No excuses; I saw <em>all </em>of it. Sill, we need to be at our best to exterminate the Goblins! That’s why, I’ll overlook it this time.」</p>

<p>In the meantime, Fran looses interest in the men and withdraws her bloodlust before walking away. I judged that it would be better not to stand out any more than this, so I instructed her to do so. The Adventurer from before, however, makes a complaint about Fran behind us.</p>

<p>「<em>You —</em> Instructor Donnadorondo just came and helped you, aren’t you going to give your thanks?!」<br>
「<em>Gahahaha!</em> That’s only natural, seeing that the young lady isn’t the one I helped!」<br>
「<em>Ha?</em>」<br>
「I couldn’t have our fighting potential decreased right before we left, after all.」<br>
「 ??? 」</p>

<p>Only Donna knows just how dangerous Fran is. Still, even Fran knows how bad it would be to reduce our forces right before the battle in the heat of the moment. Probably. Well, even if she went overboard, we’d be able to work it out with recovery magic one way or another.</p>

<p>『There might be a couple of aftereffects, though…』<br>
「?」<br>
『It’s nothing. Let’s do our best exterminating Goblins as usual.』<br>
「Nn. Of course.」</p>

<p> Definitely a reference to Lonberk from Dragon Quest. I know, because the censor moves in the next line, revealing the previously-missing character to finish off the name. (ロンベ〇ク &amp; ロン〇ルク = ロンベルク)</p>

<hr>
<p>「<em>It’s a Goblin!</em>」</p>

<p>The lookout raised a shout.</p>

<p>Using the materials we brought, we should have been in the middle of building a rudimentary base before dungeon just now.</p>

<p>From the entrance of the dungeon, a Goblin seemed to appear. We had taken out the Goblin patrols in the vicinity to prevent a sudden rush, but we fell behind schedule because of it.</p>

<p>「Teacher, there.」<br>
『Hey, construction of the base isn’t even finished yet. <em>Ah…</em> It’s a complete melee, huh…』</p>

<p>The Adventures and Hobgoblins were fighting all jumbled together. In such a state, throwing large area fire spells into the mix was out of the question. The Adventurers on the other side seemed to be fighting with Donna as their center.</p>

<p>「I’m going.」<br>
『Ok. But before storming the dungeon, we should thin out the ones outside. If the Adventures got annihilated I wouldn’t be able to sleep easy.』<br>
「Teacher doesn’t sleep.」<br>
『It’s a metaphor, a metaphor!』</p>

<p>Fran unsheathed me and started running. First, she headed to the ones fallen into crisis: the novices. Without stopping her run, she mowed down her opponents happily. As for surprise attacks from the rear, they only numbered 1.</p>

<p>「Weak.」<br>
『Even if it’s a Hobgoblin, by itself, it isn’t that strong.』</p>

<p>For now, the status of the specimens that we defeated were like this:</p>

<pre>Race : Hobgoblin Swordsman : Evil Beast : Demonic Beast Lv.8

HP: 69　MP: 38　STR: 34　END: 33　AGI: 25　DEX: 23　INT: 19　WIS: 19  

Skills:
Coercion ：Lv1, Evasion ：Lv1, Sword Techniques ：Lv1, Sword Arts ：Lv3, Leadership ：Lv1, Instantaneous Movement ：Lv2, Cooperation ：Lv2, Vigor Manipulation</pre>

<p>They’re almost the same as a Goblin King, but with a slightly weaker status. As for skills, the experience-rich Kings have more versatile ones, but these Hobgoblins have the Cooperation skill. Fighting a large group would be troublesome indeed.</p>

<p>The rubbish mercenaries that picked a quarrel with Fran before the departure were already lying dead on the ground as proof of this. Being eager for achievements, they seem have gone too far ahead, granting themselves wounds that cover their entire bodies. Even at a glance, it’s obvious that they can’t be saved. Against foes with Cooperation, even if they’re small fry, plunging into them head-first would obviously end like that.</p>

<p>Fran doesn’t seem to have noticed, or, if they were <em>truly</em> unfortunate, she may have simply forgotten about them already.</p>

<p>「<em>Haー!</em>」<br>
『It’s an all you can eat!』</p>

<p>While Fran swung me, I fired invisible attacks like Aura・Blade into the surroundings, cutting down Hobgoblins while trying not to attract attention to myself.</p>

<p>「T-Thank you!」<br>
「Seriously, this cute little girl is ――」<br>
「<em>Eh?</em> Who ――」<br>
「No way ――!」</p>

<p>Oh, the lad from before is still here. Without overdoing it, he’s been fighting steadily. Now, while being too surprised at Fran’s figure, he fell for a moment and got himself into a pinch. He was saved by a senior, though.</p>

<p>The other C and D rank Adventurers are frantically holding the entrance of the cave, so Adventurers with insufficient strength are closer to the base. Therefore, the Hobgoblins attention was naturally directed at the peerless being: Fran.</p>

<p>「Big catch.」<br>
『They keep on coming from the sides, huh. It’s good that we’re alleviating the strain on the other Adventurers, but…』</p>

<p>As for myself, I have to restrain from absorbing magic stones here. If it becomes known that the magic stones from the Hobgoblins that Fran defeated are all missing, various troubles might occur.</p>

<p>Therefore, I’m verifying their Skills one by one with Appraisal, and only absorbing the magic stones from Hobgoblins that have Skills I absolutely want.</p>

<p>『Now it should be fine, right? Quickly, let’s break into the dungeon.』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>If it’s inside the dungeon, then I can absorb magic stones without minding the people around us; I can just hide the evidence by stowing away the enemies’ corpses.</p>

<p>Fran moves towards the dungeon. At the entrance, people and Goblins are fighting, all tightly packed together.</p>

<p>「According to reports: Cave Type.」</p>

<p>Dungeons have various categories, including Labyrinth Type, Cave Type and Nature Type. Cave Type is often seen in recently-created dungeons. Traps are almost nonexistent, but in exchange there seem to be many that have complex structures — almost resembling an ant nest.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>According to the Conjurers who used disposable Familiars to scout, there were nothing resembling traps on the inside. For the large amounts of goblins coming and going traps would be a hindrance after all.</p>

<p>There was no talk about any kind of special rooms, either. About these ‘special rooms’, they’re essentially areas with peculiar effects such as sealing Transfer, sealing Recovery, or absorbing Magical Power. If they’re entered without noticing the difference between them an normal rooms, there’s a high risk of total annihilation. The ones that seemed to have ways to detect the difference concluded that there weren’t any such places here.</p>

<p>For us, this was good news. Without having to mind traps of any sort, being able to focus purely on battle is great.</p>

<p>『Forward!』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
『<em>Yahooー!</em>』</p>

<p>Fran crossed over the wall established at the cave entrance by the Adventurers by running through the air. Donna, who saw the spectacle, was astonished. With round eyes he looked up to her. <em>Oioi</em>, if Fran had a skirt on then he’d be guilty, right?</p>

<p>「That was… Aerial Jump?! Isn’t that supposed to be a Sky Knight’s unique skill?!」</p>

<p><em>Ha?</em> Is this… Slightly bad?</p>

<p>『Sky Knights? Judging from the name, it gives the impression of a fairly high ranked job…』</p>

<p>Sky Knight, huh… How highly ranked is that occupation, I wonder. Depending on the answer, the use of Aerial Jump might be barred in front of others. At any rate, it’s related to the “sky”. Seems strong.</p>

<p>「Teacher, too late.」<br>
『<em>Mu</em>…… Is that so?』</p>

<p>Well, Fran has a point there… Or rather, from now on such things will happen from time to time, so hiding everything might be meaningless in the end. If that’s the case, maybe it’s better to have accidentally used it while becoming serious.</p>

<p>「Aside from that: Goblins.」<br>
『Oops, that’s right.』<br>
「Teacher uses magic. After landing, I’ll finish them.」<br>
『Understood.』</p>

<p>Fran uses Floating, ascending even higher. Matching that, I invoked Tri・Explosion.</p>

<p><em>*DOdoDOon!*</em></p>

<p>The crowd of Hobgoblins in the vicinity of the entrance were blown away all at once. The explosion ended up creating a smoke screen in front of Donna, but even with that, with Hobgoblins as his opponents, he has the power to kill them with a single strike. Fran landed and without a moment’s delay attacked the routed enemies.</p>

<p>「Sonic・Wave!」</p>

<p>Lv5 Sword Art: Sonic Wave. It’s an art that releases a shockwave, so it was a good choice for knocking down the clustered group of Hobgoblins.</p>

<p>「Chance.」</p>

<p>With the number of Goblins at the cave entrance diminished, Fran rushed in with a <em>*woosh*</em>.</p>

<p>「W-wait! Only Rank D Adventurers and above should be entering the dungeon!」</p>

<p>We knew that, of course. However, in order to have no one hinder us from entering despite that, we went and acted before they could give out any orders. Donna and the others were still fighting against the Hobgoblins, after all.</p>

<p>「Shit–! Go, chase after the little miss!」<br>
「Ah yer right. Normally it’s ‘ye reap what ya sow’, but lettin’ such a tiny girl die just don’t sit right.」<br>
「You idiot! It’s got nothing to do with that!」<br>
「<em>Ha</em>?」<br>
「If left alone, that little miss will take all the sweet spots!」<br>
「No way, that little girl will?」<br>
「That Aerial Jump from before, and even the Magic she just cast…! When you’re thinking about that little miss, ignore her outward appearance — think of her as a remarkably skilled Adventurer wearing the skin of a child!」</p>

<p>In regards to the raw materials after the fight’s been all mopped up, the Guild splits them equally among all of the Adventurers involved (after taking a cut for itself, of course). However, you’re permitted to keep the loot for yourself if you defeat something alone, and place the corpse inside of your item bag.</p>

<p>In other words, the more you defeat, the more you earn. That seems to be a measure put in place to increase the motivation of the Adventurers, but depending on the situation I’d think that it could cause quarrels and reckless delving… Like how we delved into the Dungeon at our own convenience.</p>

<p>「Teacher.」<br>
『This is…… A clump of experience points!』</p>

<p>Within the dungeon, the Hobgoblins are packed like sardines.</p>

<p>「Please.」<br>
『<em>Ou</em>! Flare・Blast!』</p>

<p>Lv1 Blaze Magic: Flare・Blast. It’s a magic where a wave of heat is formed by converging flames. Its range isn’t particularly wide, but it’s far more powerful than Fire Magic.</p>

<p><em>*KyUUUin――<strong>BoBoOn!</strong>*</em></p>

<p>The heat ray pierced the goblins, and the shock wave mowed down any of the remaining ones. When firing this magic in a narrow space like a cave, its power is tremendous.</p>

<p>Once again, Fran plunged forward.</p>

<p>『We bought a Transfer Feather using the money we had on-hand, so let’s go as far as we can!』</p>

<hr>
<p> ‘Sky’ can also mean ‘Heaven’. (天)<br>
 This is essentially the expression ‘a wolf in sheep’s clothing’ with ‘child’ instead of ‘wolf’. In Japanese ‘clothing’ is usually subbed out with ‘skin’, too.</p>

                    <br>

        <h1>Chapter 35: Goblin Subjugation – Storming in</h1>

<p><code>Mllhild:</code><br>
To the one below: Just write more chapters and shut up.</p>

<p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p>Author’s Note:<br>
No way, ranked 1st in the daily ranking?<br>
Every time I said it, it has a certain feeling to it, but this is also thanks to the help of everyone!<br>
For the second consecutive day, I cried.</p>

<p>Also thanks for the many impressions/thoughts.<br>
Steadily, it’s getting harder and harder to reply. Therefore, I’m incredibly sorry, but I’ll have put a stop to answering questions and such. Please consider that if I did, it would cut into the time I have to write. I’m still looking over all of the comments, so please rest assured that I’m paying attention.</p>

<p>Next, thank you very much for pointing out the misspellings/typos.<br>
I was shocked at how insufficient my own check had been.<br>
The fact is that I thought I had decreased the errors as much as possible, and yet…<br>
From here on also, please point out and I will revise every such part, so please, if you could not abandon me I would be happy.</p>

<hr>
<p>「<em><strong>Haaa!</strong></em>」<br>
「<em>Gukya–</em>!」<br>
『Fire・Javelin!』</p>

<p>I scatter spells with short chanting times, shaving down the numbers of goblins. Fran cleans up the approaching goblins missed by my barrage. Together, we are cooperating well.</p>

<p>We didn’t end up stowing away <em>all</em> the corpses, either. If we didn’t leave behind a share for the guys coming in later, it would only incur more enmity than necessary. Moreover, the limit of our storing space isn’t yet grasped. If the time came that we couldn’t store any more, it would be quite unpleasant. However, all corpses whose magic stones I absorbed, we made sure to collect.</p>

<p>I use Appraisal during combat, checking our opponent’s statuses and briefly identifying their skills. If I find one with anything useful, then their magic stone is cut through, as to absorb it before its corpse is stowed away. The bodies are stored to destroy the evidence. Once the process is finished, I put Appraisal back to work on those that aren’t cut down yet.</p>

<p>Repeating the above over and over again, I’ve become strangely adept at using Thought Division. Now, casting two spells with large chants at once is possible. Since spell chants need considerable concentration, I had thought that even with Thought Division, 2 simultaneous arias would be impossible, and yet…</p>

<p>As expected, hard-to-use skills need practice to fully master them, or else their true potential can’t be displayed.</p>

<p>『<em>Hahahaha</em>, Fire・Javelin x2!』</p>

<p>Nearly 20 flame lances pour down on the Hobgoblin crowd at my shout.</p>

<p>「Teacher: amazing.」<br>
『Before long, Fran will be able to do this as well!』<br>
「Gives headache. <em>Kiーn</em>…」<br>
『Well, that’s a feeling I don’t know, so~』</p>

<p>Thanks to the fact that I don’t have a brain, I don’t get things like headaches. It’s likely because of that that I have a higher compatibility with Thought Division, too. There’s also the possibility that I’m having an easier time because I have the Sorcery skill.</p>

<p>「While fighting: aiming for lower grade spell arias.」<br>
『My next target is chanting different spells simultaneously.』<br>
「Do your best.」<br>
『<em>Ou</em>. Leave it to me.』</p>

<p>Fortunately, we don’t have to worry about running out of sparring partners here.</p>

<p>Just like that, with Fran continuing to be peerless, we pushed deeper into the dungeon.</p>

<p>Just in case, I had used Echolocation to investigate the topography of the cave, but at Lv.1 no detailed information could be gained. Given that, Presence, Vibration and Heat Perception are being used to head towards areas with a high number of Hobgoblins.</p>

<p>「Teacher, found stairs.」<br>
『So it had a second floor…』</p>

<p>The second floor seems to be just like the first. Maybe it was made simply because the density of Hobgoblins increased?</p>

<p>Well, either way, it’s good for me. I’ll be able to gather even more Skills, after all.</p>

<p>「Teacher, there.」<br>
『Oh, that’s… A treasure chest!』</p>

<p>At a dead end, an enshrined chest stands alone. It’s made out of old looking wood, and is around the size of a microwave. Its metal fittings are covered in rust, giving it a certain charm.</p>

<p>『Hm, hm! This is the ultimate charm of dungeons! Right!』<br>
「Teacher occasionally becomes like this.」<br>
『<em>Hahaha</em>! So, what now? Open it? How do we unlock it?』<br>
「Possibly a trap.」<br>
『<em>Hmm</em>. That’s right』</p>

<p>Well, in my case that’s no problem. If I use Telekinesis, then it can be opened from a remote location.</p>

<p>『Fran, take some distance.』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
『Now, let’s open it!』</p>

<p><em>*GiGii……*</em><br>
<em>*Hyun!*</em></p>

<p>From inside the treasure chest, a single arrow flies out. If someone opened it by hand, the arrow would have passed right through the middle of their head.</p>

<p>『So, it was an arrow trap.』<br>
「Cliché.」<br>
『Now then, shall we see what’s inside?』<br>
「Excited.」</p>

<p>Inside of the chest was… A small black stone.</p>

<p>The result of Appraisal was that it’s a『Pocket Heating Stone』. It’s a body-warmer type magical tool that seems to emit a scarce amount of heat when it’s charged with magical power.</p>

<p>In town, it would probably go for around 1,000 Gorudo. Maybe a freshly made dungeon only has things like this?</p>

<p>「Dull.」</p>

<p>With a flop, Fran’s cat ears hung flat. Truly, a disappointment.</p>

<p>『For gold and silver treasures or strong magic items, it seems that we’ll have to wait until a large dungeon』<br>
「Nn. At least: experience earned.」<br>
『That’s the spirit! Let’s keep going!』</p>

<p>Afterwards, as if to release her disappointment, Fran went into an even more peerless state against the Hobgoblins. Before I noticed it, it reached the point that Hobgoblins started to flee as soon as they saw Fran’s small figure. Maybe information about her spread? Well, even so, Fran chased the fleeing Hobgoblins and finished them with a single strike to their backs.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>The King and Queen also ended up being easily hunted down. Even if they’re said to be somewhat strong, in the end they’re only Hobgoblins. With this, is the commission considered complete? The cave keeps on going, though…</p>

<p>『Shouldn’t the end be around here?』<br>
「More ahead.」<br>
『Could the Dungeon Master be ahead…?』<br>
「Going while possible.」<br>
『Alright, let’s keep going!』</p>

<p>Like that, we continued pushing further into the second floor until we discovered a gate.</p>

<p>「Big door.」<br>
『Is it a boss at last? Just in case, let’s ready the Feather of Return.』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p><em>*Gigigiii…*</em></p>

<p>Using my Telekinesis to push open the gate, the door slowly opens while making a creaking sound. Beyond it is a somewhat wide room, and inside is… Nothing? No, there’re tiny presences of demonic beasts. Maybe they’re Insect types?</p>

<p>『Don’t lose focus, get it?』<br>
「Of course.」</p>

<p><em>*<strong>Batan!</strong>*</em></p>

<p><em>Ooh!</em> Suddenly the gate closed. Maybe it’s one of <em>those.</em> ‘A door that won’t open back up until you defeat the boss’ type of trap.</p>

<p>『But weren’t we told that there weren’t any traps?』<br>
「Imprisoned?」<br>
『Fran, calm down.』<br>
「It’s alight. Just need to defeat everything. Nothing changed. No problem.」</p>

<p>Right, Fran has nerves of steel after all.</p>

<p><em><strong>*BuBuBuBuBuuu*</strong></em></p>

<p>「?」<br>
『Seems that they’re coming.』</p>

<p>Gushing into the room, insect type demonic beasts with green carapaces appeared. Sprouting horns, they looked like softball-sized ladybugs. However, on the other side, a Giant Isopod-looking insect appears. Extremely disgusting.</p>

<p>They’re small fry, but their number is no joke: they easily surpass 100. Not only that, the leader has Summon Kin. If it’s not immediately destroyed, it’ll have a snowballing effect.</p>

<p>「Interesting.」</p>

<p>It seems Fran is already firmly walking the path of a battle junkie. Thrusting herself into the army of disgusting insects, she joyfully started to fight. As for me, I keep using Telekinesis to seal the movement of the insects as assistance.</p>

<p>If they’re this small, even Telekinesis at its lowest output could prevent their movement. When the opponents are larger, it’s more efficient to just throw the usual spells, but…</p>

<p>「<em>Sh! <strong>Haaa</strong>!</em>」</p>

<p>After stopping their movements, Fran pierces their magic stones. For once, an unusual demonic beast has appeared, so we’ve left behind about half of the materials to be collected.</p>

<p>The most troublesome ones are the Shooter’s Wind Magic, but its power is exceedingly weak. On top of that, their MP is low, so they run out after shooting only a couple of times. Honestly, it’s nothing more than a distraction in the end.</p>

<p>The Leaders keeps summoning subordinates one after the other, but that’s more of a reward rather than a punishment. The magic stones just keep piling up.</p>

<p>30 minutes later, on the other side of the gate, the presences of several people appeared.</p>

<p>「<em>Shit!</em> It won’t open!」</p>

<p>Donna and the others seem to have arrived.</p>

<p>『It can’t be helped. Let’s end this.』<br>
「Bonus stage……」<br>
『Now, now. I feel the same, but…』<br>
「Nn……」</p>

<p>That marked the beginning of the extermination. In rapid succession, Fire Magic and wide ranged Sword Techniques were released one after another. It was finished in no time at all. Not even lasting 5 minutes, the ~200 remaining bugs were obliterated.</p>

<p>Before anyone noticed, my Wind Magic had risen to Lv.7. That’s just how many magic stones were absorbed.</p>

<p><em>*Gashan*</em></p>

<p>『Huh? <em>That</em> side opened?』</p>

<p>The gate that Donna’s group was intensely striking against remained shut just like before. Instead, a gate hidden in the wall of the opposing side opened.</p>

<p>「Amazingly strong magical power.」<br>
『This strength of magical power… It must be equal to a C rank demonic beast — no, even higher.』</p>

<p>From the opponents I’ve come across until now, the one with the strongest magical power was the gluttonous Slime Lord. The magical power coming from beyond the gate, however, exceeds it.</p>

<p>『No way… For a recently created dungeon to have a being with such high magical power…』<br>
「Itching to fight.」<br>
『Wait, this time the enemy is really dangerous. We have to prepare properly.』</p>

<p>Antideath , status raising series, regeneration, invalidation of status abnormalities at fixed intervals and so on. Having put on as many buffs as possible, we enter the room.</p>

<hr>
<p> Not sure what this sound effect is for, but I’m thinking that it has something to do with the ringing one would hear when experiencing a headache.</p>

<p>What lay beyond the gate was completely different than the cave we were in up until now. When we entered, we were surrounded by walls made of stone bricks; it was what would be called ‘an unnatural room’.</p>

<p>「Yo, yo! Our first guest! Welcome!」</p>

<p><em>Uun</em>, a character fitting the title of an evil older brother floats in the air. His skin is black like tar, two bat-like wings sprout from his back, and horns sit atop its head.

Magic Stone Location: Heart</pre>

<p>『A Demon, huh…』</p>

<p>It’s too strong. Its Status exceeds 1000. It’s the first time I’ve seen something like this.</p>

<pre>Darkness Magic: 
The superior version of Dark Magic. It rules over darkness, shadow, poison and death.</pre>

<pre>Panic: 
Causes the abnormal mental state &lt;Panic&gt; to those who are subject to its user’s sight.</pre>

<pre>Magic Barrier: By consuming magical power, a barrier resistant to both physical and magical attacks can be created.</pre>

<pre>Skill Taker: 
After meeting certain conditions, this skill allows the user to steal skills from the target.</pre>

<p><em>Uwa</em>, his skills are also full of troublesome ones.</p>

<p>『Fran, it’s a terrible opponent. If you lose focus it’ll be an instant death!』<br>
「Nn!」</p>

<p>Having absorbed magical power from the goblins and army beetles, my MP is almost full. My skills and spells can be used as much as desired, and yet… Our victory is far from assured against the opponent in front of us. It’s overwhelming to that extent. As to be usable at any moment, I have the Feather of Return prepared at all times.</p>

<p>「<em>Hah!</em> Quite determined, aint’cha? Good! Even if I’m fightin’ a brat I won’t show mercy, got it?! You came here to clear the dungeon, after all!」<br>
「Hey, Demon! What the hell are you doing?! Quickly, dispose of that… That<em>thing</em>!」</p>

<p>Hm? Looking closer, on the other side of the room is a Goblin. Only… It’s different from normal goblins. It’s speaking words fluently, too.</p>

<p>It’s small fry-ish, but it certainly seems to be the dungeon master. Then, that thing shining in the cavity of the wall is the dungeon core? Which makes this the deepest part of the dungeon?</p>

<p>Well, in the end it’s just a small fry. Did this fellow really enslave a demon?</p>

<p>Goblins and Beetles I can understand. They’re adequate subordinates for such a weakling… But isn’t this demon far too big a jump? Maybe it’s because of a special ability given to dungeon masters? If it had a specific ability to enslave demons, that would be interesting. Still, I’m not able to identify a skill which is capable of that.</p>

<p>Another regrettable thing, it doesn’t seem to have any skills to manipulate the dungeon. Most likely, the dungeon is changed through the dungeon core. That’d have to be it, given that there aren’t any related skills belonging to the so-called dungeon master.</p>

<p>「<em>Shut it!</em> I’ll properly get rid a’ the intruders so just simmer down!」<br>
「Damn it…! I invested all the GP I had into the Monster Lottery, drawing an extremely rare, supremely ranked Demon and yet…! Why won’t it listen to my orders?! <em>Rrrgh</em>… and even in spite of being a skill-user type, its eager to fight head-on!」</p>

<p><em>Wah</em>, that’s one unbelievable exposition-speech… But thanks to it, all has become clear. As for the Goblin’s question, the demon has the Control Immunity skill, and so it doesn’t seem to accept the dungeon master’s control.</p>

<p>「How could someone have reached all the way here…! What about my handpicked elites?!」<br>
「Weren’t they done in? They were only goblins, after all.」<br>
「By such inferior creatures as humans, there is no way that my army corps of goblins, the supreme creatures, could be defeated!」<br>
「Yes, yes. You’re right~」<br>
「Regardless, I <em>order</em> you to crush that guy!」<br>
「I’d do that even without your order, y’know? They seem t’ be pretty tough.」</p>

<p>Saying so, the demon unsheathed his sword.</p>

<p>「Since this guy’s bein’ noisy… Let’s go?」</p>

        </div>
        

<p>Like that, the demon closed in with a thrust. In spite of his magic skills being higher, he himself came in for close-quarter combat. What an ultra-belligerent guy! Looks like he would get along well with Fran.</p>

<p>「<em><strong>Oraa!</strong></em>」<br>
「<em><strong>Haa!</strong></em>」</p>

<p><em>*Giiin! Gakii!*</em></p>

<p>「<em>Haha</em>! You’ve got a good sword t’ be able to exchange blows with this one!」</p>

<pre>Name ： Demonic Shadow-Steel Longsword

ATK: 561 + 450   MP: 56  Durability: 1000

Magical Power Conductivity・C+

Skills: 
Return to the Shadows</pre>

<p>The magical power conductivity is high. It seems like it’s already clad in magical power, and its ATK surpasses 1,000. Furthermore, due to the skill Return to the Shadows, even if it’s thrown it’ll return to the demon’s hand.</p>

<p>On this side, we expended about 500 MP to raise my ATK. Like that, we could exchange blows but…</p>

<p>「<em>Tsk</em>, so your sword’s superior, huh? Then, how ‘bout this?!」<br>
「? — Ku…!」</p>

<p>Just when he disappeared from sight, the bastard suddenly appeared from behind.</p>

<p>Not good! Fran’s left arm was completely severed. Large quantities of blood have started gushing out, and her the HP just keeps decreasing.</p>

<p>『What happened…?!』</p>

<p>With Telekinesis, I recovered Frans left arm and pressed the two cross-sections together. Then, in a hurry, I chanted Greater・Heal. With that, the small amount of flesh lost regrows — it’s Lv.1 Healing Magic after all. Something like rejoining a lost limb is easy.</p>

<p>「<em>Oh?</em> So you even have the Telekinesis skill? And usin’ that level of Recovery Magic, too! Are you perhaps a Magic Swordsman?」</p>

<p>The demon was laughing, but on this side it was no laughing matter.</p>

<p>『That move just now… What was that?』</p>

<p>Once again, the demon’s figure suddenly vanishes. Then, not a moment later, it attacks from the rear.</p>

<p>『Fran! Are you alright?!』<br>
「Al…right.」<br>
「<em><strong>Oraora!</strong></em>」<br>
「<em>Nn!</em>」<br>
「So, you can already receive it! You’ve got some good reflexes!」</p>

<p>No matter how you look at it, he seems to simply vanish. Teleportation? But he shouldn’t have a skill capable of such a thing. Then, perhaps magic? Dark Magic, or maybe Darkness Magic…?</p>

<p>「<em><strong>Ora!</strong></em>」<br>
「<em>Ha!</em>」</p>

<p>As expected, that’s it. Just now, when the demon transferred, magical power leaked out of his shadow. Then, he reappeared from Fran’s shadow. It’s a transfer magic that utilizes shadows.</p>

<p>If the trick is known, then dealing with it is possible. We’re able to properly grasp the moment before he reappears now as proof.</p>

<p>「<em>Hyahaa– </em><strong>Ga-!</strong>」<br>
「Too cocky!」<br>
「<em>Kahaha</em>, that’s the way to go! You’ve already figured out the trick, huh?」</p>

<p><em>Tsk</em>. To think he had this much lee-way. That strike that cut open his flank had Vibration Fang and Demonic Poison Fang added, but even with those…</p>

<p>「<em>Ah</em>? Poison? To poison me with something surpassing my Abnormal Status Resistance… Yeah, that’s the way!」</p>

<p>Yes, yes. Freaking battle junkie!</p>

<p>Demonic Poison. It falls short of the effects of Sovereign Poison and Deadly Poison, but it should still do more than an ordinary poison. And yet, because of this guy’s Automatic Recovery skill, its effects are essentially nonexistent.</p>

<p>『Fran, let’s aim for his vitals with a direct attack.』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>Our advantages in this fight are that the enemy is still taking us lightly, and that my existence has still gone unnoticed.</p>

<p>I haven’t been attacking openly, after all. Secretly, I’ve kept on assisting while keeping the Feather of Return ready for us to escape at all times.</p>

<p>「<strong><em>Haaaaa!</em></strong>」<br>
「<strong><em>Hyahaha!</em></strong>」</p>

<p>Once again the furious sword fight continues.</p>

<p><em>*pka―!*</em></p>

<p>Then, during the fight, something glittered around the two. Immediately following, from inside of the light, Hobgoblins emerged. How many? 4.</p>

<p>「<strong><em>GO</em></strong>, servants of mine! Kill the intruder!」</p>

<p>It was the dungeon masters doing. Summoning Hobgoblins here is… More than out of place, I can only say it’s astounding.</p>

<p>As should be expected, Fran and the Demon’s fight is immensely dangerous, and incredibly fast-paced. The Hobgoblins could only stand there, completely unable to interfere.</p>

<p>「What are you doing, quickly, get in there!」</p>

<p>On the dungeon master’s command, a Hobgoblin resolved itself and approached the circle of combat…</p>

<p>「Get lost!」</p>

<p>And was immediately bisected by the demon’s sword. One more was slain by Fran’s sword, too.</p>

<p>「W-What are you doing?! They’re allies!」<br>
「Such shitty small fry’d do nothin’ but get in the way! Just when it got good, too– vanish!」</p>

<p>Throwing a black ball of light, the demon blew away the remaining, pitiful Hobgoblins and sent them to heaven.</p>

<p>Angry and humiliated, the dungeon master quietly trembled where he stood. Looking at him, one could even pity him a little. Unrelated to such a miserable dungeon master, Fran’s battle was getting more furious by the second.</p>

<p>Inside of the stone hall, only the sound of swords clashing could be heard.</p>

<p>「<em>Hah</em>, this is <strong><em>fun</em></strong>! <em>Oi</em>! Still, goin’ like this it’s clear — yeah, crystal clear!」</p>

<p>Shouting so, the demon repelled me greatly before taking a small distance away from Fran.</p>

<p>Just what is he planning?</p>

<p>「Now, it’s time to settle this! First, I’ll be taking your combat power!」<br>
「?」<br>
『Crap, it’s his Extra Skill!』<br>
「<em>Hyahahaha</em>! Eat this! <em><strong>Skill Taker!</strong></em>」</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 37: Goblin Subjugation – Conclusion</h1>

<p>「Eat this! <em><strong>Skill Taker!</strong></em>」</p>

<p>The demon shouted this while pushing his hand forward.</p>

<p>『<em>Ku-!</em> He got us!』</p>

<p>Just like the name implies, it’s a skill to steal an opponent’s skill. The demon hadn’t used it at all during the fight, so I had come to the conclusion that it had some sort of difficult condition to invoke — like ‘must be touching the opponent’ or ‘must invoke over a long period of time’! But in the end, it’s merely shouting and pointing!</p>

<p>For it to be feasible to invoke it with just that…! With a shout brimming with confidence to that degree, it can only be assumed that the invocation condition was fulfilled.</p>

<p>He said that he would steal Fran’s combat power, so did he take Sword Arts and Sword Techniques? Just when I had raised those skills with great troubles…! Having to raise them a second time is… — No, rather than that, if Swords Techniques is taken right now, our death is almost assured!</p>

<p>『<em>Tsk</em>, depending on the case, we’ll have to use the Feather of Return!』<br>
「Nn!」<br>
「…」</p>

<p>The demon, still standing with his hand outstretched, didn’t move. Fran also didn’t look as though anything happened.</p>

<p>… Huh?</p>

<p>『…… Fran, are you alright?』<br>
「?」<br>
「<em>Tsk!</em> It failed, huh!」</p>

<p>Lucky. Somehow it seems to have failed. So maybe its success isn’t always certain?</p>

<p>Well, our situation is a bit unique, too. The skills Fran’s using aren’t her own, they’re mine. In other words, they’re the ‘equipped weapon’s’ special-ability category Skills. Even if a plundering-series skill is directed at Fran, it’s possible that the Skills won’t be stolen from her equipment.</p>

<p>「This damn– <em>Rrrg!</em> Can’t do anything about it if it didn’t work. In that case, eat this! <strong>Darkness・Vortex!</strong>」</p>

<p>Looking angry, the demon fired off Darkness Magic. It’s a huge vortex of darkness that shaves off the ground like a drill while approaching Fran.</p>

<p>So, he’s started using spells… Looking at his Status, he truly seems like a long distance bombardment type.</p>

<p>「<em>Haー!</em>」</p>

<p>And yet, it just can’t hit Fran.</p>

<p>「<em>Oi!</em> Once more!」<br>
「Hoー」<br>
「<em>Tsk!</em>」</p>

<p>Even if its attack power is high, his attacks are too monotonous. He’s just like the Fran from a short time ago: undoubtedly strong, but with little combat experience. Well, he <em>has</em> only just been created by the dungeon master.</p>

<p>「Dark・Spear!」<br>
『Fire・Wall!』<br>
「Darkness・Blaster!」<br>
「Naive.」<br>
「<em><strong>RRrrrg!</strong></em> Stop movin’ around!」</p>

<p>It’s Darkness Magic, so it should really have a bunch of diabolical spells attacking the opponent’s weak points… But this is several times more detestable. They’re nothing but one-hit kill spells.</p>

<p>In this match, Fran is at a disadvantage. After all, the amount of brute strength between the two is too big. Our attacks can’t attain a decisive blow, while this guy’s all bring certain death.</p>

<p>Gradually, the times that Fran speaks decrease. It seems our leeway is being lost. Should we flee now?</p>

<p>It’s just… We still haven’t raised any considerable accomplishments. By running wild in the Dungeon, we managed to cut down the number of goblins. Because of that, I think the objective of preventing them from going towards the town has been achieved… But originally, that would have been done by the C and D rank Adventurers.</p>

<p>And so, that brings us to this demon. If only something could be done about this guy, it’d be the same as capturing this dungeon. Even if it’s been decided that we’ll escape, for Donna’s group who will be fighting this guy later, I want to leave a bit more damage on this guy.</p>

<p>「Black・Bomb!」<br>
「Mu…」<br>
「<em><strong>Uwaa!</strong></em>」</p>

<p>The demon, after losing its temper, started scattering a bunch of wide-range spells. This is bad. In risk of being swallowed up, even the dungeon master is raising screams. Thankfully, we were saved by the narrow room. Had it been a bigger space, we might have been annihilated by a more extensive spell. In here, however, the dungeon master would be dragged into it.</p>

<p>『No, wait!』</p>

<p>I might have stumbled upon a good idea.</p>

<p>『He’s a demonic beast of the dungeon.』</p>

<p>I recall Donna’s explanation. He had explained a couple of things before the departure, but in summary it was stuff along the lines of ‘the dungeon core can be reused, so don’t destroy it’. At that time, he <em>also</em> gave a rough explanation of the core and its master.</p>

<p>The dungeon’s nucleus is the dungeon core. If it’s destroyed, the dungeon dies. Any created monsters, alongside the dungeon master, are destroyed in that case. The core is protected by a high density barrier so that half-hearted attacks won’t be able to destroy it, <em>but</em>…</p>

<p>Connected to the dungeon core is the dungeon master. If the master dies, the core supposedly becomes dormant.</p>

<p>More important than that, however, is that if the dungeon master gets annihilated, all dungeon monsters bite the dust — just like when the core is destroyed.</p>

<p>In other words…</p>

<p>『If that goblin gets defeated, the demon also vanishes!』<br>
「―― Fire・Arrow」<br>
「Ah― b-bastard! That’s cowardly!」</p>

<p>Seeing the spell fired by Fran, the demon performed a transfer in a state of panic, protecting the Goblin. As expected, my guess was right on the mark.</p>

<p>The dungeon master has a Scapegoat Bracelet equipped, but in the current situation, it’d use its only revival after an instant death. After that, only the worst course of events would await, so this guy can’t afford to <em>not</em> protect the dungeon master. Even though he isn’t bound by any sort of contract, it doesn’t mean that he’s disconnected from the reality that he is, in the end, a ‘dungeon monster’.</p>

<p>「<em>*niyari*</em>」<br>
「This brat– don’t get conceited!」<br>
『Fire・Javelin』<br>
「Seriously? With no chant?!」</p>

<p>Nope, it’s me using stealthily magic.</p>

<p>「Fire・Arrow!」<br>
『Tri・Explosion!』<br>
「Fire・Arrow!」<br>
『Fire・Blast!』</p>

<p><em><strong>*Bon, BAN, DogOOn!*</strong></em></p>

<p>Firing nonstop spells, the demon is completely engulfed.</p>

<p>「<em><strong>Kuー!</strong></em>」<br>
「<em>Hiiiiiiii!</em>」</p>

<p>If it’s only being grazed by the explosive flames, it’s hard for the dungeon master to die. As long as the demon bastard doesn’t move, we’re at a standstill.</p>

        </div>
        

<p>「You idiot! It’s ‘cause of this that I said t’ make my combat area in the room<em>before</em> this one!」<br>
「B…<em>B-B…<strong>B-BE QUIET!</strong></em> If you didn’t stay here, then this room’s defensive combat power is lost!」</p>

<p>This dungeon master is an idiot beyond saving.</p>

<p>Bit by bit the demon’s HP decreases, but this guy’s magic defense is higher than expected… Like this, our side will run out of magical power first.</p>

<p>『Fran, change of plans.』<br>
「Understood.」</p>

<p>I continue to cast magic non-stop with double chanting while Fran chants the Wind Magic spell she learned just now.</p>

<p>Lv.4 Wind magic: Sonic Shooter. In a nutshell, it’s a spell to increase the speed of a thrown object using the power of the wind. Once it’s used, manipulating the object’s trajectory is possible to a certain extent.</p>

<p>「Ready.」<br>
『<em>Mh</em>, I’m ready any time.』<br>
「<em>Ha―!</em>」<br>
『<em>Hyaaー!</em>』</p>

<p>I’m sent flying on a trajectory circumventing the demon, approaching the Goblin.</p>

<p>「What kind of skillful action isー! Wind magic? Even with that, I won’t let ya!」</p>

<p>Because of the spells coming from Fran, the demon can’t move imprudently. Therefore, he swung his right arm widely, wanting to knock me down. Even when coming at high speeds, the demon seems to be able to perfectly see me, huh…</p>

<p>The demon’s fist draws near, matched up perfectly ――― and misses.</p>

<p>「<em>Wha―?! <strong>Gaha!!</strong></em>」</p>

<p>At the last moment, I altered my trajectory with Wind magic and released my amassed telekinesis all in one go. It’s the nostalgic Telekinesis Catapult Attack. With it, I charged towards Demon’s defenseless torso.</p>

<p>Of course, most of our remaining magical power was transmitted into my blade. This was meant to be our final attack, so if it fails the only remaining option is to flee via transfer.</p>

<p>「Im…poss…ible…!」<br>
『I somehow made it…』</p>

<p>Even this demon couldn’t defend against the Telekinesis Catapult given these circumstances. Piercing the demon’s barrier, the tip of my blade is buried deep into its chest.</p>

<p>Still, it gave me a cold sweat when I found its left arm thrust between me and its body. When did it even do that?! Had I been stingy with the conducted magic power, I might have been in a tough spot to pierce that arm… It seems that I took the demon too lightly.</p>

<p>「N-No way… The Demon got …?」<br>
「<em>UoOo………</em>」</p>

<p>I had split the magic stone perfectly in two. Now, it was being absorbed into my blade.</p>

<p>「<em><strong>Gaaaaa―――!</strong></em>」</p>

<p>Having his magic stone completely devoured, the demon raised a dying shriek filled with agony before falling down on the spot. <em>Fuuー</em> Thank goodness. He didn’t turn into something like silver dust, so I got worried that he might have not been dead, but the raw materials — or rather, its corpse was properly left behind.</p>

<p>We won’t stow it away, however. It’s a shame, but I plan to pass the body of the demon to the Guild as an apology for rushing ahead. Besides, even if we collected it secretly, it would be difficult to keep hidden. The reason for that is related to the dungeon core’s system.</p>

<p>While dormant, the core can be used (with certain limitations) by pouring magical power into it. It’s limited to creating things that it formed while it was alive, but bringing forth Items and Demonic Beasts is possible. With the magical power of humans, nothing great can be summoned, but… Even so, anyone who touches the dungeon core can see the list of things possible to be summoned. In other words, when someone reused this dungeon core, the Demon would end up listed.</p>

<p>Yeah. Assuming we secretly take the demons raw materials, we’ll definitely be busted. Once that happens, we’re assured to have a massive amount of envy and enmity aimed at us.</p>

<p>Therefore, we’ve decided to leave the body to the Guild. But first… A small disguise has to be made. With help of an explosion spell, we blow away the area around the Demon’s heart, resulting in a large hole opening up in its chest.</p>

<p>With this, we can just say that the magic stone was smashed to pieces and vanished due of Fran’s attack. The end. It should work as an excuse for why only the body remained… I hope.</p>

<p>We could also insist that we’d only be taking the magic stone, but that would mean that Fran’s share would be too big. Doing that would definitely incur the resentment of the other Adventurers. Well, I guess there will be a lot of fellows who won’t believe that we didn’t take it too, but that can’t really be helped. One can’t give what one doesn’t have.</p>

<p>The Demon’s sword we have honorably received. If it’s this, we might be able to sell it after falsifying its origin. Worst case scenario, we’ll end up breaking it down and selling the materials.</p>

<p>Ah, while we were at it, we also finished off the dungeon master. To utilize the core, the dungeon master is said to be a hindrance after all. First, we deprived him of the Scapegoat Bracelet, then we vigorously cut him part. Scapegoat Bracelet, GET.</p>

<p>「Teacher.」</p>

<p>Fran pushed her fist into the air, making a victory pose. It was a somewhat cowardly tactic, but she looks happy having beaten a higher ranked opponent.</p>

<p><code>&lt;Self Evolution process invoked. 40 Self Evolution Points acquired&gt;</code></p>

<p>Alright! As one would expect from a demon’s magic stone.</p>

<p>From the fighting until now, my magic stone value had been 2599/2800. Now, it was 3099/3600. It ended raising by 500.</p>

<p>『With this, various power ups are possible.』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>&lt;Fran’s level has risen →<br>
&lt;Fran’s level has →<br>
&lt;Fran’s level →<br>
&lt;Fran’s →</p>

<p>Fran’s level also increased 8 times! This time we obtained something similar to a victory thanks to the incompetency of the dungeon master, it was truly a godsend.</p>

<p><em>*gogogo*</em></p>

<p>Oh, it appears that the seal on the gates have been lifted.</p>

<p>「<em>Oooi</em>! Little miss, are you there?」<br>
「I-Isn’t… Isn’t this a demon―?!」<br>
「S-Seriously?!」</p>

        <h1>Chapter 38: Goblin Subjugation – Return</h1>

<p><code>Ensig:</code><br>
Mllhild says that there’s a Data and Terminology chapter of some sort, so leave a comment on whether you want that translated!</p>

<p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p>Author Note:<br>
I received many questions related to the MC’s vision, so to any discrepancies on the subject, parts of the 1st and 4th chapter have been revised.<br>
I have the privilege of doing a detailed activity report of how people took the change:</p>

<p>The overall evaluation surpassed 20,000 points!</p>

<hr>
<p>The following concerns the return of us, having captured the dungeon, to the town.</p>

<p>In the faces of the Adventurers, profound fatigue but overall delight can be seen.</p>

<p>They had 10 casualties total, but for a Demonic Beast disaster of this scale, it appears fortunate to end with only this much.</p>

<p>For being able to quickly capture the dungeon due to us annihilating Demonic Beasts along the way, we received the gratitude of the Adventurers. You might say that not monopolizing the corpse of the demon also had a hand in our favorable reception. More precisely, that was a <em>huge</em> part of it.</p>

<p>It appears that a Demon’s raw materials are substantially higher priced than Demonic Beasts of the same rank. It’s an endemic species that doesn’t exist outside of dungeons, after all.</p>

<p>The amount of experience gained is also remarkably different; they’re said to even rival a Threat Level A Demonic Beast by themselves. Fran’s level rising 8 times is understandable in that respect. Demons appear to be quite the delicious opponents… Well, on the flip side, they also come come with the large risk of us getting eaten up instead.</p>

<p>After leaving the Dungeon, we were scolded by Donna for having rushed forward alone. We received around 1 whole hour of preaching.</p>

<p>The scene with the Conqueror of the Century’s End preaching to a small neko girl was beyond criminal — it was way too funny! When I laughed Fran pouted, but somehow she was able to bear with it to the end.</p>

<p>Also, if not for the mediation from the lad we were involved with before the departure, Donna probably would have continued for even longer. The mercenaries who picked a quarrel with Fran were dead, and the fact that he didn’t end up the same as them was thanks to Fran; because of this, he came advocating in our defense.</p>

<p>『Those guys… They really died in the end, huh…』<br>
（Even said in a good voice: can’t deceive me.）<br>
『<em>Ahaha…</em> As expected?』<br>
（Teacher didn’t get scolded. Unfair.）<br>
『Now, now.』<br>
（Only I got scolded.）<br>
『I’m sorry.』<br>
（Teacher. Lots of meat.）<br>
『Understood.』<br>
（Roasted meat.）<br>
『Alright.』<br>
（Steak and skewers, too.）<br>
『Oki-dokiー』</p>

<p>Lately, because Fran keeps eating my cuisine from Earth, I’ve started thinking that she might end up becoming a glutton character. Well, if this cheers her up, then let’s make as much as she wants! For having defeated a highly ranked opponent like a Demon, a celebration is necessary, after all. Eat as much of whatever you want!</p>

<p>But before arriving at the town, I should confirm the fruits of battle. Before ranking up it was like this:</p>

<pre>ATK ：392　Retained MP ：1650/1650　Durability ：1450/1450

Skills:
Self Evolution &lt;Rank 7・Magic Stone Status ：2599/2800・Memory ：62・Points ：0&gt;</pre>

<p>And now, it’s like this:</p>

<pre>Name ：Teacher
Equipment Registration ：Fran
Race ：Intelligent Weapon  

ATK ：434　Retained MP ：2050/2050　Durability ：1850/1850   
Magic Conductivity・A

Skills:
Appraisal Lv.7, Appraisal Concealment, High-Speed Self-Repair, Self Evolution &lt;Rank 8・Magic Stone Status ：3099/3600・Memory ：70・Points ：40&gt;, Self-Modification, Telekinesis, Telekinesis ↑ Low, Telepathy, ATK ↑ Low, ALL Wielder Stats ↑, Wielder Recovery ↑ Low, MP ↑ Low, Memory ↑, Demonic Beast Knowledge, Skill Sharing, Sorcery</pre>

<p>With each evolution, my stats become increasingly amazing. At the beginning my ATK wasn’t even 30, and my MP was no higher than 100. My Durability and MP recovery were also nonexistent. How will they end up if I rank up even further? I’m looking forward to it.</p>

<p>Next are the Skills that leveled up. The Hobgoblins and Army Beetles had reasonably high skill levels, so some have grown quite a bit.</p>

<pre>Wind Magic Lv.7, Sword Techniques Lv.8, Sword Arts Lv.9, Summon Kin Lv.6, Hardening Lv.4, Abnormal State Resistance Lv.3, Soil Magic Lv.5, Poison Magic Lv.3</pre>

<p>As for Skills, the Hobgoblins had quite a few new ones as well.</p>

<pre>Darkness Magic Lv.1, Bow Techniques Lv.1, Panic Lv.1, Club Arts Lv.1, Soul Talk Lv.1, Shortbow Techniques Lv.1, Dagger Techniques Lv.1, Taming Lv.1, Katana Techniques Lv.1, Leatherworking Lv.1, Magic Engeneering Lv.1, Magic Barrier Lv.1, Dark Magic Lv.2, Alchemy Lv.1, Cooperation Lv.5, Trap Perception Lv.1, Darkness Reinforcement, Darkness Immunity, Acid Fang, Automatic MP Recovery, Control Immunity, Skin Hardening.

Extra Skill:
Skill Taker Lv.1</pre>

<p>Despite having obtained 40 Self Evolution Points, there are <em>way</em> too many things I want to do with them, so ‘40’ ends up feeling like a small number.</p>

<p>I should raise Sword Arts and Sword Techniques, as well as some Magic… Since I got my hands on Darkness Reinforcement, maybe I should raise Darkness Magic? Summon Familiar also seems like it could be useful, so raising its level and seeing what happens might be a good idea. There’s also the previously-abandoned Instant Regeneration and Abnormal Status Resistance. Furthermore, Skill Taker is also on the list… And because the ‘transforms into a superior skill at Lv.10’ might apply to it, there doesn’t seem to be an end to my troubles in sight.</p>

<p>But, of course, I’m not the only one who gained things. Fran has reached level 25. Usually, a Demon would have granted a huge amount of experience for a <em>full party</em>, but Fran had it concentrated on her alone, so…</p>

<pre>Name ：Fran　Age ：12
Race ：Black Cat Beastman
Occupation ：Magical Swordsman 
Condition ：Contracted

Status:
Level ：12→25
HP ：189→304　MP ：115→215
STR ：92→150　END ：74→129　AGI ：82→140
INT ：50→95　MGC ：62→117　DEX ：63→108

Skills:
Goblin Slayer, Mental Stability, Skinning Expert, Indomitable Resolve, Directional Sense, Night Eyes
&lt;New&gt; Insect Slayer, Growth Efficiency ↑, Demon Slayer

Titles:
Match for a Thousand, King of Dismantling, Master of Recovery, Goblin Slayer, One who Slaughters, Skill Collector, Master of Fire, King of Cooking
&lt;New&gt; Insect Slayer, Big Game Devourer, Dungeon Conqueror, Demon Slayer</pre>

<pre>Insect Slayer: 
A Title granted to those who exterminated no less than 300 insect type Demonic Beasts in a single battle.

Effects: 
Acquisition of the Skill ：Insect Slayer</pre>

<pre>Big Game Devourer:
A Title granted to those who overcame an overwhelmingly difficult opponent alone.

Effects:
HP +20, All Stats +5, Acquisition of the Skill ：Growth Efficiency ↑</pre>

<pre>Dungeon Conqueror: 
A Title granted to those who either killed a dungeon master, or destroyed a dungeon core.

Effects: 
Inside of Dungeons: HP &amp; MP Recovery ↑</pre>

<pre>Demon Slayer: 
A Title granted to those who have slain a demon.

Effects: 
Acquisition of the Skill ：Demon Slayer</pre>

<p>Again and again came the cheat Titles. Big Game Devourer in particular is just as powerful as Match for a Thousand. Thanks to that, Fran’s status is quite something. Already, the sum of all her stats is equal to Donnadorondo’s.</p>

<p>Fran… What a frightening child! — No, it’s my fault that she’s like this. Fran has ambition, so I don’t think that she will get conceited, but… There <em>is</em> the possibility for her to search for even more dangerous places from now on. I have to stay focused and properly support Fran.</p>

<p>And so, raising Skill levels is an urgent matter.</p>

<p>『Hey Fran, which Skill do you want to raise?』<br>
（Sword Arts and Sword Techniques.）<br>
『Yes, of course.』</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">

        </div>
        

<p>This time we experienced it first-hand — just how hard it is for Magic to show results on highly-ranked opponents. With a <em>sword</em> on the other hand, even in an unfavorable position a chance for a comeback exists. In fact, I can be proud of my ability to do so due to my high Magic Power Conductivity and vast MP reserves.</p>

<p>『Then, for now shall we raise Sword Arts and Techniques?』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
『Alright, done』</p>

<p>Expending 6 Self Evolution Points, Sword Arts and Sword Techniques have reached Lv.MAX. Furthermore, Master Sword Techniques Lv.1, Master Sword Arts Lv.1 and Attribute Sword Lv.1 were derived.</p>

<p>Master Sword Arts and Techniques I can understand, but ‘Attribute Sword’? It seems to be a Skill to be used with Magic, allowing one to infuse a sword with a magic attribute for a fixed time… Well, unless we try it out, there’s no way of knowing its full effects.</p>

<p>So, what shall we raise now? There’s still Skill Taker, too.</p>

<pre>Skill Taker ：Lv.1
Allows the user to choose a single Skill with rarity ≤ Grade 1. If the chosen Skill is Lv.1, the Skill’s chance of success is 50%. Only one Skill can be targeted at a time. 
Cooldown ：1 day 
Range ：Skill Level × 1<sub>m</sub></pre>

<p><em>Ho</em>, skill rarity, huh… Appraisal’s level isn’t yet sufficient, so it doesn’t show the Skill’s degree of rarity.</p>

<p>If I used this, then even more progress in collecting skills could be made… Furthermore, if it became possible to steal an opponent’s Skill, battles could become even easier. Above all, it would be possible to obtain skills which I previously couldn’t get my hands on — ones from beings without magic stones… Skills from civilized races.</p>

<p>What to do about this… I’m already totally enthusiastic, but what about Fran?</p>

<p>『Say, about Skill Taker――』</p>

<p>With that, I explained the general stuff to Fran.</p>

<p>（It’s good.）<br>
『Is that so?』<br>
（Extra Skills: definitely super strong.）<br>
『Alright. Then, let’s level it up.』</p>

<p>Ending up recklessly charmed by her cute words, I decide to raise it to Lv2 see what happens.</p>

<pre>Skill Taker ：Lv.2
Allows the user to choose a single Skill with rarity equal or below grade 2. If the chosen Skill is Lv.2, the Skill’s chance of success is 60%. Only one Skill can be targeted at a time. 
Cooldown ：2 days
Range ：Skill level × 1<sub>m</sub></pre>

<p>What? Lv.2 and 60% chance? A-Alright, let’s raise it some more!</p>

<p>Leveling up Extra Skills seems to cost 3 points per level, so my remaining Self Evolution Points are only 7… But I don’t regret it.</p>

<pre>Skill Taker ：Lv.Max
Allows the user to choose a single Skill with rarity equal or below grade 10. If the chosen Skill is Lv.10, the Skill’s chance of success is 100%. Only one Skill can be targeted at a time. 
Cooldown ：18 days
Range ：Skill level × 1<sub>m</sub></pre>

<p>Nothing that can be done about the 18 day cooldown, so we’ll just have to think properly about when to use it. Well, in our case Fran and I each have a chance, so we should be able to use it a bit more carefreely. I’ll definitely have to investigate what Skills would have rarity Grade 10 later.</p>

<p>Maybe I should raise Appraisal’s level for that? If by any chance Skill Taker can steal Extra Skills and Unique skills, then it’d be unbelievably strong. To put it bluntly, it’d be a complete cheat.</p>

<p>I want to use it at once, but… There’re only allies around us. Won’t some bandits appear? Well, even after thinking that, I know that bandits that would come to take on a bunch of adventurers don’t exist.</p>

<p>And so, without anything occurring we reached the guild.</p>

<p>It was in quite the festive mood when we arrived. Adventurers were rejoicing at our victory while we received the remuneration for our efforts. Everyone’s face is cheerful.</p>

<p>「Little miss, come over here for a moment.」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>Led by Donna, Fran and I move towards the Guild Master’s room. None of the other Adventurers are surprised. They understand that Fran contributed the most, after all.</p>

<p>Various rumors had gone around, but even Adventurers who doubt Fran’s ability seem to have come to the understanding that her summons has to do with her involvement in the subjugation.</p>

<p>「<em>Ahh</em>, must be nice. It’ll be a bonus for sure, right?」<br>
「Can’t be helped, it was a spectacular victory.」<br>
「She saved my life, y’know?」<br>
「What did she do to become so strong at that age…?」<br>
「She’s a monster I say. A monster!」<br>
「Maybe she’ll want to enter our party?」<br>
「<em>Haaa… Haaa…</em> Fran-chan, <em><strong>CUTE!</strong></em>」</p>

<p>The voices are split into Good Will: 5, Envy: 4, and Disgusting: 1. — Hey wait, this last guy is just plain creepy!</p>

<p>「Ah, Fran. I’ve been waiting.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「First, I’d like to express my gratitude. Thanks to you, the subjugation ended with very few casualties. For a dungeon of this degree to have a demon… If we had conquered it normally, the number of fatalities wouldn’t have been a laughing matter.」</p>

<p>His words held a hint of gratitude, but a smile didn’t cross his face. This person was different from Donna in that he doesn’t let his guard down. Even now I get the feeling that he’s doubting us.</p>

<p>「Still, stealing the march on everyone else and going out on your own is troubling. That being said, this time we escaped harm because of it, so I won’t rebuke you for not complying with orders.」</p>

<p>It seems that after weighing various factors in the subjugation, the result ended up with us avoiding any punishment.</p>

<p>「As for the demon you were said to have defeated… I saw the corpse.」</p>

<p>Donna <em>would</em> need to show it to him, after all.</p>

<p>「I’ll be frank. That was a Threat Level B specimen. Did you really defeat it by yourself?」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「Then… If that’s true, then it means your abilities are befitting of an A rank.」</p>

<p>I’m pleased with the evaluation, but if our rank was suddenly changed to A and we got assigned dangerous commissions right away, I’d be troubled.</p>

<p>「Had luck.」<br>
「Oh? In what way?」</p>

<p>For now, we decided to tell the truth.</p>

<p>「I see, so you aimed at the Dungeon Master to restrain him, then got him by surprise…」<br>
「Dungeon Master: an idiot.」<br>
「Even so, not dying instantly is still strange… Besides, about this demon’s corpse…」<br>
「?」<br>
「The fatal attack to the heart. How many people do you think can pierce a tenacious Magic Barrier and defeat a Demon?」<br>
「Mmh?」<br>
「<em>Haa</em>… That’s… Well, alright. Then, onto the real issue.」</p>

<p>As expected, he’ll ask about it?</p>

<p>「What happened to the Demon’s magic stone?」<br>
「Annihilated.」<br>
「… Such a creature’s magic stone is tremendously useful. It’s valued so highly that entire countries would desire it.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「And you truly don’t have it?」<br>
「Doesn’t exist anymore.」</p>

<p>I’ve absorbed it after all.</p>

<p>「<em>Haa</em>… I understand. I’ll believe you.」</p>

<p>We didn’t lie, so… Perhaps we’ve managed to deceive him for now?</p>

<p>Then, the moment I became relieved:</p>

<p>「Wait a minute! Do you seriously plan to overlook this just like that!?」</p>

<p>Vigorously opening the door with a <em>*<strong>BAAN</strong>*</em>, somebody barged into the room.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 39: A Cliché ‘Foolish Noble’ Appeared</h1>

<p>The one who barged into the Guild Master’s room was a fat, sluggish, unhealthy looking man clad in silver armor.</p>

<p>… Who the heck is this? I didn’t see him on the way in — I couldn’t even sense his presence… <em>Ah</em>, maybe it’s an effect of his equipment?</p>

<pre>Name ：Auguste Alsund　Age ：29
Rage ：Human
Occupation ：Soldier
State ：Normal

Status:　
Level ：30
HP ：108　MP ：99　STR ：52　END ：53　AGI ：45　INT ：50　MGC ：47　DEX ：45

Skills:
Acting Lv.1, Singing Lv.1, Horsemanship Lv.1, Deceit Lv.1, Court Etiquette Lv.4, Sword Arts Lv.1, Arithmetic Lv.1, Socialising Lv.2, Poison Resistance Lv.1, Poison Knowledge Lv.2, Herbalism Lv.2

Unique Skills:
Law of Lies Lv5

Titles:
Viscount, Vice Commander of Aressa’s Knight Order

Equipment:
Mithril Longsword, Sturdy Silver Full-Body Armor, Red Lion Mantle, Ring of Presence Concealmen</pre>

<p>He’s quite unbalanced, isn’t he… Despite being Level 30, his status values are low — probably around that of an E Rank Adventurer.</p>

<p>Besides that, his Skills are beyond lame. Things like Socializing are high, so he’s probably a noble of some sort, but something like Sword Arts Lv1… Isn’t that way too low for a Knight? And yet, despite that he has the title of Vice Commander?</p>

<p>「What exactly are you referring to with, Sir Auguste?」<br>
「Exactly as should be expected! A Demon’s magic stone? A thing of such value… For a young girl to monopolize it is absolutely <strong>unacceptable</strong>!」<br>
「I thought that’s what you were meaning, but… Regarding subjugations, the raw materials of Demonic Beasts defeated completely by oneself are granted wholly to the person in question. She, having defeated the demon, has the legal rights to the Magic Stone. Or rather, for giving the Demon’s raw materials to the Guild despite that, there isn’t a single reason why we should hold her at fault.」<br>
「<em>Nonsense!</em> If it was something to the degree of <em>Hobgoblin</em> materials, then you could let her have as many as she wants, but high-ranking materials like the ones from a <strong><em>Demon</em></strong> — just handing it over to the likes of a low-class Adventurer would be <strong>absolutely absurd</strong>!」</p>

<p>In the end, it seems that the materials we obtained were even more amazing than I thought. I’m regretting giving that body away a bit, now…</p>

<p>「This young girl, didn’t she arbitrarily act on her own? <strong>That’s clearly a violation of orders</strong>! This sort of person, does she even have the right to receive a proper reward?!」<br>
「<em>Fuu…</em> If we’re moving to the subject of ‘order violation’, then believe me when I say it really can’t be helped. Just about every Adventurer would end up as subject to that judgement, after all. In fact, it would be rather strange if Adventurers <em>didn’t</em>behave on their own accord. If you know of an Adventurer that hasn’t violated any rules or orders, then please, I would very much like to meet them.」<br>
「So you’re all just a band of <strong>low lives</strong> after all…」<br>
「Well, compared to the well-behaved gentlemen of the Knight Order, it’s a given that we’d end up looking like a gathering of crude ruffians.」</p>

<p>The Guild Master’s eyes aren’t smiling at all while he speaks… One can even feel the blood thirst being emitted. It’s gotten to the point that I’ve started admiring this fat noble for not noticing it at all. Maybe because his facial skin is so thick, he ended up being naturally thick-headed?</p>

<p>「<em>Hmm</em>. Then let me tell you something good. This lass is lying, alright?」</p>

<p><em>*Giku-*</em></p>

<p>Ah, is that this fellow’s unique skill?</p>

<pre>Law of Lies 
Allows the user to see through lies spoken by others, while making one's own lies become harder to be seen through. Furthermore, the user’s lies will be easier to believe by others.</pre>

<p>It’s an ideal Skill for crooks, dictators, and founders of questionable religious sects. How does this guy own such a Skill and still only have the rank of a Vice Commander in a local Knight Order? In regards to the type of position held by hated people in fantasy novels, isn’t the scale too small?</p>

<p>Depending on the way it’s used, it’s a skill capable of doing horrendous things, and yet… Well… I suppose this just goes to show you that no matter how excellent a Skill is, its power is fully reliant on its user.</p>

<p>It would seem that we’ve been driven into a corner… Or, we would be if his next words were what I expected. But they weren’t.</p>

<p>「She said that the Magic Stone was annihilated, but that was <em>definitely</em> a lie. There’s no doubt that she’s hiding it somewhere.」</p>

<p>Huh? No, that wasn’t a lie, you know? To say ‘it was annihilated’ was the truth.</p>

<p>「… Even if that’s the case, she owns the property rights to the Magic Stone.」<br>
「No, a false report in this sort of situation <strong>can’t be tolerated</strong>! Besides, what if she’s hiding something else, too?」<br>
「Really annihilated.」<br>
「Are you <strong>still lying</strong>?」</p>

<p>What the heck is this guy saying? Since he can detect lies, he should know that what Fran said was the truth…</p>

<p>― No, that’s just it, isn’t it? It’s possible that he’s well known for having the Law of Lies Skill. In that case, if he says that someone is lying, then they’re automatically turned into a liar. Using that, he’s planning on setting Fran up.</p>

<p>「?」<br>
『Fran, don’t talk for now』<br>
（Understood.）</p>

<p>Now, the real question is ‘What’s his goal?’…</p>

<p>「This isn’t the site for official talks — she only came here to talk privately. Even if she spoke in jest, there isn’t any sort of law that would find fault in that, is there?」</p>

<p>The Guild Master is strangely covering for us. Perhaps he has a hatred of nobles? Well, regardless of his reasons, I’m grateful. Go for it, Guild Master!</p>

<p>「She attempted to steal from nobles like myself while we weren’t aware: no matter the place, that’s a crime!」<br>
「I will say it once again: I wasn’t aware that something like telling a joke was a crime.」<br>
「Regardless, this girl <strong>isn’t trustworthy<strong>! </strong></strong>I’ve heard that you don’t even know her birthplace! She might be a <em><strong>foreign spy!</strong></em> Deliver <em>all</em> of her belongings to the Knight Order! If we receive and inspect the goods, no more will be said about her rude conduct today.」</p>

<p><em>Haa?</em> This fellow, what did he just say? Deliver her belongings? Isn’t that just a cover up for extortion? Does he seriously think we’ll abide?</p>

<p>「What are you saying?!」<br>
「To begin with, you bastards of the Adventurers Guild ignored our Knight Order and went to the Goblin Subjugation on your own, right? You <em>loathed</em> that us elite Knights would snatch away the gains — an appropriate behavior for <em>vulgar</em>Adventures. If you hand over the Demon’s raw materials, we just might overlook this slight.」<br>
「<em>Haa?</em> We <em>did</em> contact the Knight Order. The date and time we planned on carrying out the Subjugation were properly conveyed.」<br>
「<em>Humph</em>, don’t <strong><em>lie</em></strong>! At least half of the loot, all of the Demon’s materials, and this girl’s baggage: <strong>hand them over<strong>!」</strong></strong><br>
「Half the gains? All of the Demon’s materials? There is no reason to give such things to the Knight Order that didn’t even do anything.」<br>
「What are you saying?! You bastard Adventurers — too blinded by greed with what’s waved in front of you — made light of protecting the town and went towards the Goblin den! While you did so, we Knights carried the town’s public order <strong>on <em>our</em> backs!</strong>」<br>
「So, you all got cold feet and didn’t want to participate, thus ignoring our request…」<br>
「<em>Oi</em>, did you say anything?」<br>
「No. Nothing.」</p>

<p>So it was like that… The Knight Order was scared of the Hobgoblins, so they deliberately ignored the appeal for participation in the Subjugation campaign. And so, the Adventurers went alone. When they returned, they not only had very few casualties, but also produced tremendous gains. Now, the Knights want in on those gains.</p>

<p>So, who’re the greedy ones again?</p>

<p>「<em>Oi</em>, kid! For starters, hand over that sword. It appears to be considerably beautiful, so where did you steal it? <strong>Speak the truth!</strong>」</p>

<p>The shitty, fat noble approached.</p>

<p>（Kill?）<br>
『Wait, let’s observe a little while longer.』</p>

<p>I also want to beat him into the dirt and chop him up, but we should refrain.</p>

<p>「Inside the Guild, the Knight Order has no authority. Even so, do you still insist on ordering us around? To demand us to hand over half the gains that the Adventurers risked their lives for?」<br>
「It’s our natural right.」</p>

<p>This bastard, he really said it. And now, even more tremendous bloodthirst is gushing out of the Guild Master. <em>Uwa</em>, after getting this angry, he’s done well for enduring the desire to start a fight. Instead, he’s just smiling cheerfully on the surface… This Guild Master is a man worthy of respect.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>「<em>First</em>, hand over signed contracts. <em>You</em>, bastard, if you write your name here then the delivery of the raw material will be accepted.」<br>
「Is this the consensus of the Knight Order? Or, to rephrase my question, the Commander also knows of this, right?」<br>
「…… Of course.」<br>
「Then, is it fine for me to inquire?」<br>
「<em>H-Huh</em>? That… There is <strong>no need for such —</strong>」<br>
「The one who decides that is me.」</p>

<p>It seems that the tides have changed.</p>

<p>「To inquire about something like this, is there any problems with that?」<br>
「<strong>D-Don’t joke around!</strong> Are you saying that I’m lying? Un-Unbelievable. For today I will take my leave!」</p>

<p><em>Uwaa…</em> He totally hit the nail on the head, huh. Whether it was for earning reputation among his peers or for indulging in embezzlement of profit, it’s certain that this guy came here without permission.</p>

<p>『Ok, let’s try it out on him.』</p>

<p>Try what, you ask? Skill Taker, of course. He even has a Unique Skill all nicely prepared, after all.</p>

<p>（I want to try too.）<br>
『<em>Mh</em>. First, I will attempt it.』</p>

<p>The target is obviously the Unique Skill. Thinking about it, this Skill would be quite hard to use on an opponent if you didn’t have Appraisal, huh…</p>

<p>I’m mentioning that because the Demon didn’t have Appraisal. The Dungeon Master had said that he won the Demon through something like a gacha-automat, so maybe the Demon’s Skills were strange because of that? Or perhaps Demonic Beasts won in the early stages of a Dungeon all have random Skills? Or maybe the Dungeon Master simply forgot to add Appraisal to its Skills…?</p>

<p>Yeah, that last one is the most likely.</p>

<p>「I <em>will</em> come again!」</p>

<p>Oops, the sucker almost left.</p>

<p>『Skill Taker!』</p>

<p>― ― Success. The best part of this Skill is that it has no visible effects, allowing it to secretly steal Skills. It’s truly villainous.</p>

<p>Law of Lies: Lv5, get! With this, we’ve verified that Unique Skills can be stolen. Furthermore, it seems that the Skill’s true danger is that the stolen Skill remains at the same level when it’s taken. If a high leveled Skill was stolen, you’d suddenly become an expert.</p>

<p>The flaw is that the Unique Skill that I gained doesn’t count as a Set Skill. Whether for good or bad, because it’s registered as mine, I can’t share it with Fran. The opposite will most likely hold true as well. In the future, we’ll have to choose who steals what depending on the situation.</p>

<p>「Skill Taker.」</p>

<p>Following me, Fran muttered in a tiny voice. Naturally, this was also a success. The next highest Skill, Court Etiquette Lv4, got stolen.</p>

<p><em>Kukukuku</em>. It’ll be quite entertaining when he notices that his precious Skills are gone!</p>

<p>（Teacher. Did it.）<br>
『Ou, it was a huge success.』<br>
（Now: kill?）<br>
『Can I kill him, can I kill him… Why do you want to put an end to him so much?』<br>
（Hate him.）</p>

<p>I have a hunch that this child is gradually becoming dangerous… Right, shouldn’t she become more ladylike and refined now that Court Etiquette has been obtained? No? It’s impossible after all, huh…</p>

<p>「<em>Haa…</em> I’m very sorry about that.」<br>
「Who was that?」<br>
「A greenhorn son of a big noble, and also the Vice Commander of Aressa’s Knight Order. He’s a snob that bought his position with gold, and because his pedigree is good he’s hard to deal with. Around one year back he moved here, and ever since he’s been brandishing his social position at every opportunity. Because of that, he’s hated by most of the town. Showing such foolish behavior towards the Guild is a first, though.」<br>
「Complain to the Knight Order?」<br>
「Impossible. With people like him, their parents will suppress any complaints to the end. It’s because of that that he’s grown up to become such a fool, too. Moreover, he possesses a Skill called Law of Lies that can see through lies… To be frank, even I can’t deal with him, and he can’t be taken lightly.」<br>
「Small fry, but Vice Commander? With money: it’s OK?」<br>
「You should take complaints like that to the country itself. Anyways, small fry or not, his level is reasonably high. It’s often said that nobles party up with strong Knights and hunt Demonic Beasts to raise their level, so that’s likely the case for him.」</p>

<p>So, it’s real power-leveling huh. If it’s like that, then it’s no wonder that his combat-series Skills haven’t grown. In the end, he only has the <em>appearance</em> of a level 30 knight.</p>

<p>「Next time: beat to a pulp.」<br>
「If possible, please don’t. The Vice Commander is a fool, but the Commander is a reasonable fellow, so if I report this event to him the Vice should behave for a short while.」<br>
「Alright.」<br>
「Really, don’t. If it becomes a situation where you started a fight, the troubles won’t end with you alone.」</p>

<p>It’s for your own sake after all, huh. Well, in this person’s case, a give-and-take relationship is probably more reliable than friendship anyways.</p>

<p>「Once again, for offering us the Demon’s raw materials: thank you very much. Thanks to that, the Guild has profited greatly.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「So, do you really have the Magic Stone?」</p>

<p>Es tu, Guild Master!?</p>

<p>「It’s a joke.」<br>
「Dangerous.」<br>
「What is?」<br>
「Almost reached for it.」<br>
「<em>Hahahaha</em>! That’s quite scary! Well then, please take care around him. He abuses his Skill to see through lies and has been remorselessly tricking others.」<br>
「It’s alright.」<br>
「Is that so? If you say so, then it doesn’t matter, but…」<br>
「Finished?」<br>
「Yes, thank you again. <em>Ah</em>, but one last thing.」<br>
「?」<br>
「Please go rank up at reception. I’ve already processed the documents.」<br>
「Again?」<br>
「Yes, again. You raised outrageous accomplishments, after all. An Adventurer who exterminated a Demon alone… It’s not possible for such a person to claim to be Rank F. For now, your rank will be raised to D.」<br>
「Not E?」<br>
「I planned to raise it to C, but as expected I wasn’t able to obtain the other branches’ consent.」</p>

<p>Well, that should have been obvious. A 12 year-old girl who just became an Adventurer independently crushed a Rank B Demon? What kind of adventure novel would that situation come from? In fact, getting raised to D is already a stretch.</p>

<p>「Understood. Going to reception.」<br>
「Please treat us well from now on. Your compensation will also be paid when you get there — alongside a bonus.」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>It seems that the rumor that we’d be ranking up at the reception spread, so the other Adventurers got noisy. Apparently, this was the fastest rank up in this Guild’s history. It’s only been 4 days since we registered, after all.</p>

<p>It started with betting on whether it was actually Fran that would be ranking up, but through skipping a rank, we appear to have caused some really heavy losses… Or rather, the racket we caused became even louder than originally expected.</p>

<p>「<em><strong>Haha!</strong></em> Thanks to the little miss, I made a killing!」<br>
「<em>Shiーt!</em> Such a heavy loss…!」<br>
「<em>Wahahahaha!</em>」<br>
「So, how is it? Shall I treat you to a drink?」<br>
「Idiot, as if such a small child could drink alcohol!」<br>
「Thanks.」<br>
「O-Oh! You can?」<br>
「Then, let’s get you an Apple Juice!」</p>

<p>And with that, Fran’s rank went up to D. Rank D, huh… She’s already a splendidly ‘average’ Adventurer.</p>

<p>Thinking about today’s events, maybe it would be better if I reveal myself? There might be even more situations like the one from earlier, but if it’s a Rank D Adventurer, then having a slightly odd Magic Sword wouldn’t be all that strange.</p>

<p>A sword that grows stronger by absorbing magic stones… If that much was revealed, it would also become easier for Fran. Anything more than that… I don’t know. Next time, let’s try asking Old Man Gallus for some advice.</p>

<p>Anyways, in relation to the Demon’s Magic Stone, most of the fellows seem to think that Fran is secretly holding on to it, so revealing myself is no problem. Their understanding will simply change from 「She’s secretly holding onto it」to「Her sword absorbed it」. If it’s like that, then returning only the Demon’s raw materials to the Guild is fine. It’s also thanks to that that everyone got a bonus.</p>

<p>So… Next, shall we provide today’s alcohol on us? Accumulating small favors is important, after all.</p>

<p>「Today: my treat.」<br>
「What’re ya sayin’? As if I’d let m’self be treated by such a small kid!]<br>
「It’s okay. Also got a bonus」<br>
「<em><strong>Ohh</strong></em>. How generous!」<br>
「Not fat.」<br>
「<em>Gahaha</em>, ain’t you amusing, lil’ miss!」<br>
「Then, I’ll be regaining my losses through drinks!」<br>
「<em><strong>Wahahaha!</strong></em>」</p>

<p>In the end, those drunkards managed to drown no less than 100,000 Gorudo…</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <p>It"s been 2 days since the Goblin subjugation.</p>

<p>We"ve come to the guild to look for a commission, but it"s not for the money. At the moment our pockets are full, after all.</p>

<p>After selling off all of the Hobgoblin Horns, looted equipment, and the materials from the Beetles, we gained around 30,000 Gorudo. Considering the fact that they were materials from small fries, you could say they were sold a bit on the expensive side. Furthermore, some of the Hobgoblins" equipment included weak magic items, so those were particularily expensive.</p>

<p>On top of all that, we received quite the bonus for our participation in the subjugation. The standard participation reward was 30,000 Gorudo, with any bonuses[E1] amounting to ~40,000 Gorudo. Fran"s special bonus was another 300,000 Gorudo on top of that.</p>

<p>Adding the cash we gained from selling the raw materials, our total income was ~400,000 Gorudo. Or, it would have been, but because we treated everyone to drinks, it decreased by 100,000. Because the other Adventurers got a nice bonus out of the subjugation, they ended up turning up in the morning to thank us.</p>

<p>Anyways, today"s request will be for the sake of gaining experience. As a consequence of our irregular rank ups, we have insufficient experience in completing "normal" requests. In fact, the only one would have been the commission for collecting Heal Grass.</p>

<p>Therefore, we decided to look for a normal request.</p>

<p>『The only commissions Fran can take as a Rank D are marked C, D or E Rank.』</p>

<p>We"re no longer eligable for easy G and F Rank commissions. They wouldn"t have been bad commissions to accumulate experience…</p>

<p>『Harvesting, escorting, patrolling the highway, and assisting in construction with magic, huh.』<br>
「Subjugation commissions: good.」</p>

<p>Assuredly the most convenient requests for us are subjugation commissions, but the bulletin board doesn"t have any of our Rank. Are they popular?</p>

<p>『How about asking Ms. Nell?』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>Luckily the lineup to the reception desk was also barren.</p>

<p>「Nell.」<br>
「Oh, Fran. Good day[M1].」<br>
「Good day.」<br>
「About the recent Goblin subjugation, you played quite an important part in it, didn"t you?」<br>
「Well.」<br>
「You even ended up defeating a demon. Waa~, isn"t that amazing~? You"re cute, strong and lovely!」<br>
「Thank you.」<br>
「Kyaaaan! An embarrassed Fran is also cute~!」</p>

<p>W-When did they get so close? Unbeknownst to me who is with Fran almost 24/7, did they get together at some point? Just where the heck…?</p>

<p>「No subjugation commissions?」<br>
「Ah, right now there are none, huh~ Well, to begin with, the recent Goblin stampede was an abnormal case, right? Usually, Demonic Beasts seldom appear so easily.」</p>

<p>Of course. If hoards of Demonic Beasts appeared in the vicinity of the town resulting in subjugation commissions being emitted every day, then the daily lives of normal citizens wouldn"t be possible after all.</p>

<p>Still… It appears that the number of Demonic Beasts in the vicinity of Aressa is even less than we thought.</p>

<p>「Understood.」<br>
「Ah, wait a moment. It"s not a subjugation commission, but there is a request that you"ll certainly encounter Demonic Beasts in, is that ok?」<br>
「Where?」<br>
「Mh~ Wait….This one.」</p>

<p>Hm? Investigation of the ecology of the Poisonous Swamp? "It"s possible that Demonic Beasts have settled in the swamp[M2] situated near the Forest of Starvation. Verification of their existence is needed before starting the reclamation project"?</p>

<p>「The area mentioned is a troublesome swamp that poisonous gas spills out of occasionally; the gas causes poison damage to any peddlers going through it.」</p>

<p>It seems because of that, there"re plans to fill up the poisonous swamp… But before sending in the workers, it"s necessary to investigate whether or not there"s any danger. It"s especially so since there are rumors of Demonic Beasts living there, so this investigation appears to have maximum priority.</p>

<p>「A subjugation party would usually be sent out, but…」<br>
「Defeating them all: OK?」</p>

<p>Fran, that"s a death flag!</p>

<p>『Fran, that"s no good.』<br>
「? Don"t defeat?」<br>
『No, I don"t mean that part, but…』<br>
「It"s no problem if you defeat them. Rather, doing so would cut down on the labor.」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>It"s no use. I"ll just have to carefully pay attention.</p>

<p>「While you"re at it, why not take this commission as well?」<br>
「Medical plant harvesting?」<br>
「Right. It"s a herb called New Moon Grass, and it"s quite rare. It doesn"t grow close to the town, but if it"s close to the poisonous swamp then I think you should able to find it.」<br>
「Understood. I"ll take it.」<br>
「Thanks. I pray for your good luck. Let"s meet again in the baths?」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>Now I see, so it was in the inn"s bath! Well, that"s good. Proactively wanting to interact with others besides me, that is.</p>

<p>『According to the map… The swamp"s a little ways away from where we met Randell.』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
『If we depart now, I get the impression that we"ll return… Probably the day after tomorrow?』</p>

<p>A sleeping bag, blanket, and cookware is all we brought. With that, our camping preparations were complete.</p>

<p>◇◆◇</p>

<p>「That?」<br>
『Looks like it.』</p>

<p>Around 100 meters worth of wetlands can be seen ahead of us.</p>

<p>We barely noticed any time passing since we left the town.</p>

<p>On the way here, the only enemies we met were Black Bugs and Giant Centipedes. I suppose because we having smashed their den, we didn"t encounter a single Goblin.</p>

<p>In regards to any Demonic Beasts that leave a Dungeon prior to its defeat, after a few days their link to the Dungeon is severed. Because of that, even when the dungeon "died", the Demonic Beast that left the Goblin Den didn"t end up getting exterminated. Instead, they continued living on the outside.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>And so, the moment the Dungeon got shut down all the Hobgoblins got annihilated, but the regular Goblins who had already left the dungeon should have still been roaming around here…</p>

<p>I guess most scattered or ran way. Even while camping, we weren"t attacked even once. Needless to say, we were extremely bored.</p>

<p>「Smells like poison…」<br>
『Abnormal State Resistance is set, alongside Poison Breath and Poison Absorption. There"re no problems.』<br>
「No Demonic Beasts?」<br>
『Seems so. Yet, if they"re lurking deep in the swamp it"s possible that we won"t be able to sense them.』<br>
「Attacking with magic.」<br>
『Wait, wait! If you blow it up imprudently, then poison will end up scattered all over the place.』</p>

<p>The end goal of the commission is to reduce the damage coming from the poisonous swamp, so what are you thinking, trying to amplify it…?</p>

<p>『A way to minimize the collateral damage…』<br>
「Fill it with Soil Magic.」<br>
『The swamp is too big. Soil pollution is also a concern.』</p>

<p>Hmmm… Maybe I should try leaving Fran behind and scanning the area by myself?</p>

<p>「Store the swamp.」<br>
『?』<br>
「Dimensional Storage: absorb swamp water. Like that: Demonic Beast left bare.」<br>
『G-Genius? Indeed, that"s a good idea.』</p>

<p>They wanted to reclaim the swamp anyways, so there shouldn"t be any problem. If they"re a group of people with high awareness, then they might be noisy about environmental problems or destruction of nature, but… I don"t want to hear it! Even after coming to a different world, I don"t want to care about stuff like that! That"s only to be expected, right?</p>

<p>『Then, I"ll be storing the swamp"s water.』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>This will also be a good experiment. Currently, my Dimensional Storage"s limit still isn"t in sight. Adding up all the harvested Demonic Beast materials, it should currently contain about half of a 25ⅿ pool.</p>

<p>So, let"s see how much swamp water it can take. It"s quite a large swamp, and its depth also seems to be considerable, so… Its Volume must be quite immentse.</p>

<p>『Alright! Harvesting: start!』</p>

<p>*Zuzuzuzuzu― ―*</p>

<p>Slowly, the water level drops.</p>

<p>『It… It won"t stop.』</p>

<p>Eh? Far from the limit being reached, the swamp"s water is already decreased by half and the storage still isn"t getting close to full.</p>

<p>『… I ended up harvesting it all.』<br>
「More space?」<br>
『Yeah. My guess is that it"s not even half-filled.』</p>

<p>I think that around five 25 meter pools[M3] worth got absorbed, so… Dimensional Storage is incredible.</p>

<p>「Lots of Demonic Beasts.」<br>
『Hee, those?』<br>
「Fish.」</p>

<p>Appearance wise, they look like cow-sized Catfish.</p>

<p>Race ：Madness Fish ：Demonic Fish ：Demonic Beast Lv7</p>

<p>HP ：100　MP ：32　<br>
STR ：33　END ：39　AGI ：38　<br>
INT ：10　MGC ：22　DEX ：17</p>

<p>Skills:<br>
Stealth Lv3, Presence Perception Lv3, Poison Secretion Lv4, Poison Resistance Lv7, Tunneling Lv3, Water Magic Lv2, Poisonous Fangs[E2]</p>

<p>Description: <br>
A troublesome Demonic Beast that produces poison from its skin to kill other aquatic creatures and defend itself. Throughout history, there have been Villages that were annihilated when one appeared in its water source. Its staple food is a peculiar seaweed that grows even in contaminated waters. Its body is exceedingly delicious. Because it is naturally endowed with Poison Resistance, its body contains no poison. Threat level E.</p>

<p>Magic stone location: Head, interior of the brain.<br>
Weak. Going by its status, it"s a small fry. Still, with poison related abilities and the ability to hide beneath the water"s surface, it"d be quite a nuisance. Well, it was no trouble for us though.</p>

<p>There were 5 of them total, but they were easily dispatched and Dismantled on the spot. The muddy poisonous fish scales, poison glands and poison fangs were stripped off immediately.</p>

<p>The body appears as though it"d be delicious, and from the bones a Dashi[M4]could be made. Fish dishes can now be added to our cooking repertoire.</p>

<p>『With this, the commission is complete. Next is collecting medical plants, so let"s finish it quick and return.』</p>

<p>Author note:<br>
I"ve been informed that when clicking on an author"s name, some couldn"t get to the author"s page and see the activity report. So… Authors shouldn"t use pen names?</p>

<p>When I go to look at the activity reports of others, I just click on the Author"s name and go to their page, where their activity report can usually be seen, but…<br>
Is there some where that isn"t the case?<br>
I haven"t mastered Narou"s functions by any means, so right now I don"t know what to do. I"m sorry.</p>

<p>That being the case, in the afterword of the next chapter I will include a detailed record. I also have been considering adding settings and other such things to the data in Chapter 0.</p>

<p>[E1] It wasn"t directly mentioned, but I"m pretty sure most (if not all) of the "bonuses" being talked about here is from the Demon"s materials.</p>

<p>[M1] Nell used "konichiwa", so it can be assumed that Fran came to the adventure guild after 10AM. That"s pretty late considering the fact that commissions are usually posted first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>[M2] Numa = lake/pond/bog/swamp, aka "a body of water". I"m going with "swamp" since no one makes reclamation projects for a lake, and also because the water quantity is about 2,500㎥, which is a bit low for a lake.</p>

<p>[M3] 5 × 974㎥ = 4,970㎥ = 1,312,935Gallons</p>

<p>[E2] 毒牙 (@ the Footnote) ≠ 毒の牙 ("Poison Fang" in previous chapters). The former doesn"t have a level, so I figure it"s more of a Passive skill. That being the case, its name will be "Poisonous Fangs".</p>

<p>[M4] Japanese soup stock. Google it for images.</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <p>It’s now been 7 days since the Goblin subjugation</p>

<p>It’s late at night, and we’re in the inn’s kitchen.</p>

<p>As promised to Fran, I’m here to cook her some food. Since the sight of a lightly floating sword cooking would certainly cause a commotion, Fran is here with me too.</p>

<p>The cooks said “If it’s late at night after the Dining Room is closed, then there’s no problem”, so we’ve properly received permission. With this, I’ll give my all at cooking!</p>

<p>『<em>Chan Chan Chara Chachacharara~</em>』<br>
「Chanchan?」<br>
『<em>Chanchara, Chan Chan Chan~</em>』<br>
「?」<br>
『Welcome! It’s time for Otherworldly Cooking!』<br>
「<em>Oh~~</em>?」</p>

<p>Not understanding the meaning of my words yet still guessing the mood, Fran started clapping.</p>

<p>『The first meal today is… This!』<br>
「Meat?」<br>
『Correct! Prepared for you today is minced meat from Rock Bison and Crash Boar: 30<sub>㎏</sub> of each!』</p>

<p>Moreover, Rune Tulip bulbs that resemble onions, Golden Chicken eggs, breadcrumbs, and all sorts of spices were also prepared.</p>

<p>『Then, knead this Fran.』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
『You should make use of what you have, right?』<br>
「With this: able to eat Teacher’s cooking every day.」<br>
『Considering your Titles, you should also be able to make good dishes.』<br>
「Can’t make what I don’t know.」<br>
『Ah, that’s right after all.』</p>

<p>What Fran wants to eat is Earth’s cooking, and no one but me can make that. Even if similar cooking is possible, in the end the degree of refinement would end up different.</p>

<p>So, with that I went on to chop the Rune Tulip bulbs. For the sake of cutting them into fine pieces, I’ve decided to use Aura・Blade.</p>

<p>So far, I had used myself after taking a thorough wash through boiling and purification magic, but… Still, I had used Demonic Poison Fang for slaying Demonic Beasts earlier, so a bit of anxiety still remains. Until now Fran’s shown no sign of bad conditions, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s safe.</p>

<p>The finely chopped Rune Tulips were carefully stir-fried in the frying pan.</p>

<p>『Mix together the minced meats, then make an onion-shaped ball. After that, add spices and keep on mixing.』<br>
「Leave it to me.」</p>

<p>I also mixed the remaining minced meat with Telekinesis. When that was completed, 60<sub>㎏</sub> worth of special-hamburger base was completed.</p>

<p>Honestly, I had a feeling that I went overboard, but… When it’s put into Dimensional Storage it won’t go bad, so it’s fine.</p>

<p>『Now let’s start grilling the hamburgers.』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>Even using an enormous oven with Magic to shorten the process, it couldn’t be done in one go.</p>

<p>『In the meantime, the next step is to cut up all of these vegetable-like ingredients and put them into a stew.』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
『Then, I’ll also begin cutting.』</p>

<p>The ingredients besides Demonic Beast flesh were arranged plentifully.</p>

<p>Affected by the ambiance of the town market, I now realize that I may had gotten a bit carried away. After following my instincts, I got completely swept up in buying ingredients… A large earthenware pot of Miso and Soy Sauce alongside a giant bag of spices were also bought. After that, several super-extra-large sized pots got purchased.</p>

<p>Because of that, another 100,000<sub>Gorudo</sub> ended up being used. Ha… Hahaha…</p>

<p>— No, it was for the sake of making delicious meals for Fran, so it was necessary!</p>

<p>『Now we add some water… And next, we’ll throw in the spices.』</p>

<p>I added heat with Magic while using Telekinesis and Magic to shred the vegetables like a mixer. When finished, it was a specially-made <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3hP59AZ.jpg">demi-glace</a>. It smelt good, to say the least.</p>

<p>After that, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/juFUFbH.jpg">tomato sauce</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/MTmWx9J.jpg">consomme soup</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/52snsSZ.jpg">chicken bouillon</a> and so forth were also made. At this point I’ve started instructing Fran on the ways to use the ingredients.</p>

<p>「<em>Guro</em>, <em>guro</em>.」<br>
『Mhm. Keep stirring, just like that.』</p>

<p>Around the time the third batch of hamburgers were cooked, all the soup and sauces were completed.</p>

<p><em>Good</em>,<em> good</em>. If there are matching seasonings at the market, then I’m able to make any cuisine!</p>

<p>I cover the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/eKqsnPR.jpg">hamburgers in demi-glace sauce</a> and toss them into Dimensional Storage one after another. The plan is to have them available regardless of the time and place while still steaming hot.</p>

<p>In the same way, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5aKZIuL.jpg">tomato juice</a> and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Ukmwul6.jpg">japanese ponzu</a> flavored ones were made. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/LVkflRL.jpg">Tyrant Tiger Stew</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Adnfo3o.jpg">Deep Fried Blast Turtle</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/b3wZ9S0.jpg">Dopple Snake Kabayaki</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/dfpwlF1.jpg">Fried Stone Spider</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/68L6GCZ.jpg">Stewed Rock Bison Tongue</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/txIRRRv.jpg?2">Ginger Air-grilled Crash Boar</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/jsFTzXD.jpg">Sausages</a>,<a href="https://i.imgur.com/4atJNTy.jpg">Bacon</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Djs1bbz.jpg">Jerky</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/B0sVe4s.png">Meat Miso</a> and other such dishes were completed as well.</p>

<p>『Alright. The meat dishes are almost finished.』<br>
「Nn!」</p>

<p>Before long, dawn broke. We’ll end here today and continue tomorrow.</p>

<p>◇◆◇</p>

<p>And so, we’re once again in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Today we’ll be doing fish-based cooking. — Well, even if I say that, I don’t have any fish ingredients other than the Madness Fish meat. I think I’ll turn it into<br>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/jTw02rQ.jpg">Nitsuke</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/YwPP40k.jpg">Shioyaki</a> and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NdNTCL9.jpg">Tempura</a>.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>I also considered making some into <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vaYu1Yf.jpg">Meunière</a>, but as expected a Japanese should eat Japanese cuisine! Er… Not that I’d be eating it, of course.</p>

<p>Ah, by the way, about the poisonous swamp: it seems that our actions turned into some sort of ghost story about a suddenly-vanishing poisonous swamp. Ms. Nell knew that we did something, but it seems that she wasn’t the type of person who would spread that information to other Adventurers. Maybe we overdid it…</p>

<p>Oops, while thinking the Nitsuke finished. It’s got a good color to it.</p>

<p>Well, that’s about all for the main cooking, but we’re not fished yet.</p>

<p>Next are the side dishes. Let’s start off with soups. We’ll be re-using the soup-like things made yesterday, but this time we’ll fine-tune them with salt and pepper as well as throw in some other ingredients. A <a href="https://i.imgur.com/n5z29MF.jpg">Consomme Soup with Sausages</a>… Wouldn’t that be delicious?</p>

<p>Furthermore, making use of the Madness Fish bones, the chinese <a href="https://i.imgur.com/K4Wb71A.jpg">Fish Dashi Soup</a>was also completed.</p>

<p>Of course, I didn’t forget about <a href="https://i.imgur.com/GjPKKMN.jpg">Salad</a> and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Pk6Txxn.jpg?1">Stir-Fried Vegetables</a> either. The nutritional balance has to be enforced with an iron grip with Fran in her growth period. Related to that, her current state is quite worrying. Lately she’s gotten somewhat better-rounded, but compared to the other kids in town she still looks feeble. Furthermore, it feels like her height is little short… Meals are important, no matter what.</p>

<p>「Nn?」<br>
『No, it’s nothing. Next are the staple foods.』</p>

<p>Somehow, I had made light of Aressa’s market, as today I found myself surprised that even <a href="https://i.imgur.com/hXiicGh.jpg">Rice</a> was sold there. In this area, the Northern and Southern regions appear to meet, so Rice and Wheat-based items are both eaten.</p>

<p>The Rice is cooking quietly, in several earthenware pots we bought for its sake.</p>

<p>Of course, flour is also being made use of. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/uCLyO7p.jpg">Udon</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Dt216qt.jpg">Bread</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/9ANwC3M.jpg">Naan</a> and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NNAt7A4.jpg">Okonomiyaki</a>, all such carbohydrate-parade foods were around. Bread could be found in the standard baguette type, but there were also the rectangular type that Japanese people love.</p>

<p>We also made <a href="https://i.imgur.com/c27uM08.jpg">Chinese Noodles</a>, since Lye Water was also at the market.</p>

<p>I don’t think that any mistakes were made when kneading the noodles, since the process of making them went well because of the strange water. And so, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/stakqbv.jpg?1">Ramen</a>,<a href="https://i.imgur.com/xAbTng3.jpg">Yakisoba</a>, and more could be made.</p>

<p>Now, since we have rice and Naan… <em>That</em> has to be made.</p>

<p>『Well then, next I was thinking of making a special dish.』<br>
「Special?」</p>

<p>Hey, hey, your expectations are a bit too high if your eyes are gleaming like that… Well, I guess I’ll just need to do by best, huh?</p>

<p>「What is it?」<br>
『It’s a special-hyper-ultra dish! Its name is ―― <strong><em>Curry!</em></strong>』<br>
「<em>Kuuree</em>? What is it?」<br>
『<em>Fufufufu</em>. Well, you’ll see.』</p>

<p>Curry was my favorite food back on Earth. Here, I don’t eat — not even a single sign of appetite has shown up thus far. But the feeling of wanting Fran to eat delicious food is there instead. Therefore: Curry needs to be made. We can’t go on without it.</p>

<p>『Break the spices like this.』<br>
「Beautiful.」<br>
『It’s for the sake of making a delicious curry.』<br>
「Cook it?」<br>
『Right. While blending it, you keep on cooking.』<br>
「Hmmm.」</p>

<p>One hour later, 3 business sized pots filled to the brim with curry sit in front of us.</p>

<p>In the beginning, we finished with just a normal sized pot. Spices are expensive, after all.</p>

<p>However, after Fran taste tested the first batch, she kept on eating it at a dreadful pace. In the blink of an eye, we ran out. Afterwards, upon Fran’s continuous demands, all of the remaining spices were put towards making curry in vast amounts.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/o7X7Gc6.jpg">Sweet</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/lWOsFc3.jpg">mild</a>, and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/oPfxYMS.jpg">scathing</a> flavors were made, and the vegetables and meat were altered to fit. Even if I say so myself, they’re masterpieces. If we took them to Japan, I have absolute confidence that it would sell.</p>

<p>「I was born to meet this dish.」<br>
『You like it that much?!』<br>
「Thanks Teacher.」<br>
『That feels like the most emotion-loaded “Thanks” I’ve received up until now…』</p>

<p>I have to make sure that Fran doesn’t eat only Curry from now on…</p>

<p>Counting all the dishes made in these 2 days, ~2000 portions should have been made. In other words, we’ve made over 1 year’s worth of food. However, contrary to her appearance Fran is a big eater, so the chances that it’ll disappear sooner than that is quite high.</p>

<p>Well, with this there won’t be any concerns about meals for a while at least.</p>

<p>「For now: second serving of curry.」<br>
『But you just ate…』<br>
「Please.」<br>
『… It can’t be helped. Only one more serving, alright?』<br>
「Nn!」</p>

<p>Fran exercises properly, so just one more shouldn’t hurt… Right?</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <p>It’s now been 10 days since the Goblin subjugation.</p>

<p>This morning, we returned after what seemed like a long time to Gallus’ shop. As usual, merchants had intense looks in their eyes while they loitered around his store.</p>

<p>「Afternoon.」<br>
「Well, if it isn’t little miss and Teacher! It’s been a while! What can I help you with today?」<br>
『First things first, how’s the armor coming along?』<br>
「<em>Gahaha!</em> It’s going fine! When you see it, you’ll definitely be surprised!」<br>
「Looking forward.」<br>
「So, did you only come to ask for an update?」<br>
『No. Actually, we wanted a bit of advice ――』</p>

<p>I explain to the old man how I grow stronger as Magic Sword through absorbing Magic Stones. Since Gallus hadn’t leaked the fact that I was an Intelligent Weapon, he seemed like a trustworthy fellow.</p>

<p>「I see, so you had that type of ability… And, essentially, you’re wondering whether it’s alright for others to know or not?」<br>
『Uh-huh. So, what do you think?』<br>
「Hmm… I think you’d better not.」<br>
「As expected: unusual.」<br>
「Got that right. I’ve heard of large scale Magical Tools having similar traits, but for a sword to have such ability… It’s the first I’ve heard of it.」</p>

<p>So my abilities were something that even a famous Blacksmith hasn’t heard of? In that case, it’s definitely not on the level of a normal person’s knowledge…</p>

<p>「As expected. Teacher: amazing.」<br>
「A bit <em>too</em> amazing. Intelligent Weapons aren’t unheard of, but one that can grow by absorbing Magic Stones — and even gets skills through them to boot… It’d be easy to see something like that being labeled as a Divine Sword.」</p>

<p>Divine Swords: equipment of legends. The ones that exist are undoubtedly super weapons. Compared to me, they’re on a whole different level of might.</p>

<p>「A single Divine Sword can easily influence the military balance between Nations, you know.」<br>
『It’s at that level?』<br>
「Aye. Even though my knowledge only covers 5 of them, each one has unbelievable legends associated with ‘em.<br>
Being the origin of the ‘Divine Sword’ title, the first divine sword: Alpha.<br>
Achieving fame in a war which ruined entire Countries, the divine sword that brings abnormal mentality to its wielder: Berserk.<br>
Having served a single horseman to kill an army measuring 30,000 strong, the Battle-Horse sword: Chariot.<br>
Considered to have sealed the Demon King itself, the Demon King’s sword: Diablos.<br>
And then, the sword of flame that we’ve already spoken about before: Ignis.<br>
In addition to those, there’re several other Divine Swords. Almost all of them have stories of mass-slaughter, and end with sites of great destruction in the end.」<br>
「Divine Swords: amazing.」<br>
「Well, there’s always some exaggerations mixed in with their tales, but without a doubt they’re on completely different levels. Of course, every Nation keeps their blades’ locations a secret, and the whereabouts of the Divine-Class Master Blacksmith(s) who forged the Divine Swords is completely unknown. Whether they’re still alive, or if a new Divine Class Blacksmith was born… Anything related to them is unknown.」<br>
「Why?」<br>
「That’s the question, isn’t it. Maybe they didn’t want to be used by governments and hid, or… Maybe they’re being sheltered by the Gods. There’re lots of rumors, but the truth is unknown. It’s for that reason that each Nation keeps an iron grip on the Divine Swords that they know of.」<br>
『So, they’re existences of that magnitude, huh…?』<br>
「Right. If by any chance the information that you’re a Divine Sword spread… No doubt people would come to steal you for the sake of acquiring your strength. And it wouldn’t be some small number, either. It wouldn’t even matter if you were<em>actually</em> a true one or not; in such peoples’ eyes, it’d be fine to steal first and verify later. After that, they’d test you out to measure your ability.」</p>

<p>Whether it’s entire Nations or simply individuals, Divine Swords are certain to be aimed at by many.</p>

<p>「Even if their opponent wields a Divine Sword: surprise attacks, poisoning… There’re always ways to give themselves an edge. Since your wielder is the little miss, some might turn to ‘sweeter’ forms of persuasion, but…」<br>
『In the end, it’s better to keep my abilities hidden.』<br>
「You ought to do that. I’m happy that you came to open up to me, but make sure you don’t become careless and get discovered from now on, alright?」</p>

<p>The risk gained from revealing my abilities is far too large. For now, let’s keep it a secret.</p>

<p>◇◆◇</p>

<p>After departing from old man Gallus’, we went to the Guild to turn in our commissions as per usual. We were doing well day after day ―― would be something I say tentatively, but it’s a fact that we’ve been steadily piling up completed commissions. There was nothing else to do, after all.</p>

<p>「Today: also disappointed.」<br>
『There was nothing besides insects, after all.』<br>
「No consistency when chewed.」<br>
『On this side, I’ve only gained 7 points in Magic Stone Value in these 10 days…』</p>

<p>Commissions like ‘harvesting’ or ‘investigating’ are nice, but our desired Experience Points and Magic Stone Value aren’t being gathered at all.</p>

<p>『Fran is Level 25 now, right?』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
『Then… From now on, it’d be best not thinking that you’ll be leveling up as fast as you used to.』<br>
「Next: dungeons?」<br>
『Haunts, probably.』</p>

<p>According to the rumors we’ve heard, Haunts have Demonic Beasts in high numbers, just like Dungeons. It’s for that reason that they’re known as “Boundaries of Demons“, after all.</p>

<p>Maokami Plains also falls under that category. I think above 90% of the creatures there were Demonic Beasts, after all.</p>

<p>That being said, I’d prefer not going back there. Not only is there the fact that we’d have to get close to the Forest of Starvation, but it also appears that the Threat Level in the plains skyrocketed since I left.</p>

<p>Around the time we came to town, the Adventurers made an investigation of Maokami Plains — as to keep an eye on the turf war between large scale Demonic Beast. The reports filed to result of said investigation confirmed the presence of several Rank B Demonic Beasts.</p>

<p>During the time I was there, neither shadows nor figures of such beings were present. However, when talking about Demonic Beasts, even without breeding they can be produced spontaneously when magic power coagulates. Most likely, the Demonic Beast that showed up were born like that.</p>

<p>If that’s the case, then after I departed, Rank B Demonic Beast were born…</p>

<p>— Really close!</p>

<p>If they had been born any earlier, I might not be here now. Or rather, that fact is almost certain.</p>

<p>There’s even the possibility of an A Rank existing there, so the reconnaissance team’s main body is still in the middle of continuing the survey. Because the danger is high in the Plains itself, they’re supposedly observing from inside of the Forest of Starvation. Staying in that forest for a prolonged period: thanks, but no thanks.</p>

<p>Anyways, an A Rank, huh… For such a being to have come into existence… Saying that the Plain is an A Rank Haunt gives me a bad feeling, but I can agree with it. Or rather, I should probably count my lucky stars that the Demonic Beasts were weaker while I was there.</p>

<p>「Then: dungeon delving after all?」<br>
『That’s also possible.』</p>

<p>However, our taking down the Demon in this last Dungeon was largely due to luck. If the Demon was cool-headed and came to finish us off at long range, then we would have had to flee without being able to do anything.</p>

<p>『Let’s not challenge Demon bosses if we come across any. We might be able to handle weaker ones, though.』</p>

<p>Hm… From now on, we should collect information on Dungeons and Haunts. We can’t leave the town before receiving the armor from Gallus anyways.</p>

<p>（Check up on dungeon info?）<br>
『Mh. Let’s pass the rest of the day doing that.』</p>

<p>We’ll have time to spare no matter what we do, so let’s take our time searching the Guild’s reference room for today.</p>

<p>In the second floor of the Guild is a room dedicated to books and documents. I can’t really imagine many Adventurers reading documents as part of their preparations, but there seem to be some people here and there. They’re all Scouts or Mages. Different from the muscle brains responsible for the vanguard, they came to search for information on their commissions, I guess.</p>

<p>One can really see the sorrows of the intellectual Adventurers up here.</p>

<p>「Oho. Is this your first time here, missy?」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「Then, let me take a look see at your Adventurer Card.」</p>

<p>At the Reference Room’s reception desk sits an old man with a small build. He’s bald with a white beard that reaches his chest, and his eyebrows have grown to the degree of hiding his eyes entirely. Even if he’s wearing a classy robe, I can only think of him as a hermit.</p>

<p>『He brings quite the pointless ambiance…』<br>
「<em>Hoho</em>, so <em>you’re</em> the rumored Magic-Sword Girl, eh?」<br>
「Rumored?」<br>
「That’s right! Lately, you’ve become quite the talk, missy. Because of that I immediately recognized ya!」</p>

<p>So rumors have started to spread, huh. Well… There’s not much that can be done about us standing out like a sore thumb at this point. Judging by the old man’s response, the rumors don’t seem to be bad at least.</p>

<p>「I’m Shuuren, and this here reference room is managed by me.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「Taking documents outta here is forbidden, but transcribe ’em all you like. A single parchment is 300<sub>Gorudo</sub>, and you can loan a pen for 30<sub>Gorudo</sub> per hour.」</p>

<p>Paper is quite expensive… Well, information is valuable in the long run, after all.</p>

<p>After buying one sheet of parchment, we start searching for the desired documents. Since Shuuren showed us where the documents were whenever we asked, finding things was quite easy.</p>

<p>The first thing we looked for was a map of the continent.</p>

<p>Taking a look at it, we’re currently in the Jylbard Continent. Its form seemed close to a <a href="http://www.thepirateking.com/images/weapons_caltrop.jpg" target="_blank">caltrop</a>. It’s probably around the size of Africa, but that’s just conjecture. In the first place, it’s questionable whether or not the map is accurate.</p>

<p>The town of Aressa belongs to a Kingdom called Kranzell, and it’s located in the Western part of the caltrop-like Jylbard Continent. I didn’t know until now, but if you went West for ~5 days from here, you’d probably be able to reach the sea.</p>

<p>『So, places with Dungeons close to Aressa include… Illuuf and Urmet.』</p>

<p>Illuuf is in a neighboring country to the North, and belongs to the BeliosKingdom. If we can’t cross the border, then no matter how much we struggle there’s no way we’d be able to reach it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Urmet lays South of Aressa, and also belongs to the Kranzell Kingdom, so there shouldn’t be much trouble with entering it.</p>

<p>（Both have dungeons.）<br>
『Illuuf has one C Rank Dungeon.』<br>
（Urmet: two D Rank Dungeons.）</p>

<p>So, do we take quality or quantity? <em>Hmm</em>… I personally think that Urmet would be the best choice. There wouldn’t be any problems regarding borders, and it’s probably best to accumulate experience in lower ranked Dungeons first.</p>

<p>『So, which one?』<br>
（Urmet. Warm up with D Ranks first.）<br>
『I also agree. Then, let’s keep researching. This time, let’s aim for information regarding the Dungeons of Urmet.』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>After that, we should find the route we’ll be taking to get there, and any stops we should take along the way. There appears to be both a land and a sea route, too.</p>

<p>『By sea or by land… Which would be better, I wonder?』<br>
（Land route would be easier.）<br>
『That’s true. By the way… Have you ever been on a ship Fran?』<br>
（Once, as a slave. Was kept crammed at the bottom.）</p>

<p>Somehow… I’m sorry. Or rather, that’s her only memory of a boat trip! That’s no good! No way that can stay like that!</p>

<p>『I-Is that so. Well then, how about this time we enjoy ourselves on the sea route?』<br>
（Enjoy?）<br>
『<em>Ou</em>. Traversing the sea on a boat is enjoyable. There’re also delicious marine products to be had.』<br>
（… Fish?）<br>
『There’d also be Shrimp, Lobster, Crab, and other shellfish too. There’s a great variety.』<br>
（Nn. No choice but the sea route, then.）</p>

<p>So it’s for food in the end… Well, with that we’ve decided in favor of the sea route.</p>

<p>◇◆◇</p>

<p>「Nーn…」</p>

<p>Fran stretched out over the table. It seems that her body has gotten stiff from sitting for so long… Probably. We’ve been in the Reference Room for 2 hours straight, after all.</p>

<p>『Then, the things we should research later would be…』<br>
（Nn. Urmet’s delicacies.）<br>
『Well, there’s that too, but there are also other things to investigate, you know…』</p>

<p>Passenger fees, planns for our exact route, and so on.</p>

<p>（Right. Those too.）<br>
『… Do you really understand?』<br>
（Can’t go without investigating specialities.）<br>
『<em>Ah…</em> Oh well.』</p>

<hr>
<p> A note on ‘Haunts’: in Japanese, it’s 魔境, which can also be ‘Boundary of Demons’. Info on Haunts was introduced in C15. A tl;dr version is ‘they’re areas under the control of Demonic Beasts’. Just restating because C15 was released a while ago.</p>

<p> ‘シューレン’</p>

<p> ‘ジルバード’<br>
Note that ‘バード’ is the term commonly used in RPGs as ‘Bard’.</p>

<p> ‘クランゼル’</p>

<p> 1 day = 40<sub>㎞</sub> usually, as walking speed is ~5<sub>㎞</sub> per hour. Then, the time to build/take down camp before/after 12 hours of daylight needs to be taken into account — but ‘5 days’ could be air distance, too. With all this information, maybe I should make a map?</p>

<p> ‘イルーフ’</p>

        <h1>Chapter 43: What he Became</h1>

<p>We’re walking towards the exit of Aressa.</p>

<p>We’ve taken a simple commission again today while searching for some Demonic Beasts. You could also say that there was nothing else to do besides this.</p>

<p>「Yo! Another commission today?」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>One of the gatekeepers ― Dert ― calls out to us as we leave. He was the person who admitted us when we first arrived at this town. Thinking about it, we’ve formed a pretty good relationship with this uncle. We pass by almost every day and Fran stands out, so I suppose it was only a matter of time. He’s a nice person. Even to the unsociable Fran, he tries to talk to her every day.</p>

<p>A guardsman showing a different reaction to Fran’s unsociable-and-sour impression at first glance would be understandable, but Dert seems a bit soft. Testament to their relationship building, Fran’s lowered her guard a little.</p>

<p>「Cute, as always.」</p>

<p>… Isn’t this guy just a lolicon?</p>

<p>「That reminds me, are you acquainted with Viscount Alsund?」<br>
「?」<br>
『He’s talking about <em>that</em> guy. The noble who came complaining to the Guild.』<br>
「<em>Ah</em>. Small-Fry Vice Commander.」</p>

<p>To Fran’s words, Dert was momentarily astonished before proceeding to laugh.</p>

<p>「<em>Hahahaha</em>! Yeah, yeah, that’s the one.」<br>
「What about him?」<br>
「<em>Ah</em>, for some reason it looks like he’s searching for little Fran. It’d be best to be careful. Yesterday, some fellow calling himself the guy’s subordinate came here to check if you passed through.」</p>

<p><em>Hooh</em>. How suspicious.</p>

<p>「Since he’s a noble, he does whatever he pleases in the town… Even more, he seems to have a skill to see through lies.」<br>
「I know.」</p>

<p>In reality, he <em>had</em> the Skill to see through lies. Now, <em>I</em> have that ability.</p>

<p>「So, about that Skill: in the world of nobles it’s something of a godsend. Giving its user the ability to grasp their opponent’s weakness, and allowing quick dispersion of political opponents… Those guys, telling lies is as easy as breathing for them, after all.」</p>

<p>Mr. Dert, I must say, you’re my kind of guy. The type of guy who holds prejudice against nobles!</p>

<p>「Because he has that Skill, even if that Viscount causes trouble his parents crush any complains. And because of that, he got excessively carried away and became prone to doing foolish things. Those actions extend to little Fran as well, so I have no idea what he might want with you.」<br>
「Understood. I’ll be careful.」<br>
「Good to hear. Ah, also on the subject of the Viscount, I caught wind of a slightly dangerous rumor.」<br>
「Rumor?」<br>
「Mhm, it’s from a few days back. It seems that Viscount Alsund’s state has started to become… <em>Odd</em>.」<br>
「How so?」<br>
「Well, he abruptly began acting suspiciously. Just when rumors started appearing stating that he might be becoming mentally ill he committed a terrible fault in the company of Royalty. I don’t know the full details, but apparently his family was enraged — there were even talks this was the last time he wouldn’t be forsaken. Thereafter, it’s just been getting worse and worse. Various rumors like ‘he’s been cursed’ or ‘he’s been possessed by the Evil God’ are flying about.」</p>

<p><em>Uwaa</em>, and that guy might be stalking us? That’s scary.</p>

<p>「Well, anyways. Take care!」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>Our commission today is to harvest New Moon Grass. Since Fran still remembers where it grows, we should be able to complete it no problem. While we’re at it, we plan on seeing how the development of the Poisonous Swamp is going. If things go well, we’ll find a couple of Demonic Beasts along the way.</p>

<p>◇◆◇</p>

<p>A short time after advancing on the highway, we sensed a couple of presences.</p>

<p>（Teacher.）<br>
『Yeah. We’re being followed.』</p>

<p>The number of people tailing us is two. One is amateurish — he isn’t hiding his presence or anything. It’s completely laid bare.</p>

<p>We slowly change our course off of the highway, and as we do so the presences follow after us. As expected, we’re being pursued.</p>

<p>Like that, we advance for a short while into the forest, and allow the presences to close in.</p>

<p>「O-Oy! Stop <em>right</em> there!」</p>

<p>From behind, an angry voice is heard. To be lured here unawares… He’s truly praise worthy.</p>

<p>「That’s… Small-Fry Vice Commander?」<br>
『Viscount Augusto, right?』</p>

<p>So, Dert’s warning came true. The one besides him is probably a subordinate or something… But somehow, he doesn’t give of the impression of a Knight. Anyways, for Augusto, at first glance you wouldn’t be able to know that it was him. It’s just to that extent that he’s changed.</p>

<p>His cheeks are collapsed inwards, with bloodshot eyes and untidied hair which was falling out at certain points. He was going bald from misery… It’s an appearance that wouldn’t be out of place in a horror movie as a vengeful ghost. Erm… He didn’t become an Undead, right?</p>

<p>Just what happened to him in these 10 days? He was a sickening fellow, sure, but when I see him in this state I end up feeling a bit sympathetic.</p>

<p>「Y… Yー… You!」</p>

<p><em>Uwaa</em>… He’s drawing near…</p>

<p>「I’ve c-come to take c-compensation f-for… The <em>r-rudeness</em> you committed against me in the <em>G-Guild</em>!」</p>

<p>That’s quite sudden. Without any introductions, he’s abruptly started shouting. Since he’s doing so after such a transformation, I have a bad hunch.</p>

<p>「Who might you be?」<br>
「W-What? Are you saying that you have… <em><strong>F-Forgotten</strong></em> myself?!」<br>
「It’s our first time meeting.」<br>
「T-Truly? <em>N-No</em>, don’t lie! There’s no way that’s–」<br>
「Truly Truly. Mistaken for someone else.」</p>

<p>It seems Fran doesn’t want to get involved. Has he really fallen this much? No… That shouldn’t be enough to deceive him. Right?</p>

<p>「<em>Eh</em>? It’s… Truly a misunderstanding? No — it’s a lie! A… <em>Lie</em>… Right?」<br>
「Not a lie. Truth.」<br>
「<em>Eh? <strong>Eh</strong>?</em> It’s not a lie after all? It’s really not?」</p>

<p>Maybe he’s believing it because he’s gone a bit loopy? There’d be no way he could believe that otherwise… Will Fran actually get away with this?</p>

<p>That’s what I thought, but…</p>

<p>「<em>Ah</em>! T-That Sword! A-After all, you <em>are</em> the beastgirl from the Guild!?」</p>

<p>Sorry Fran. Because of me, he noticed.</p>

<p>「A-After all, it was a lie, right?! <em>Shit…</em> Everybody keeps telling me nothing but lies… !」</p>

<p>You don’t say!</p>

<p>「T-That sword, g-give it here!」<br>
「No.」<br>
「<em>S-<strong>Shut up</strong></em>! F-filthy Adventurers like you shouldn’t defy <strong>N-Nobles</strong>! H-Hand it over!」<br>
「Don’t want to.」<br>
「I-I-I’m the one who decides that! Me! Auguste Alsund!」</p>

<p>Augusto clawed the nails of his right hand into head, scratching and tearing away at his skin. Hair quickly falls and blood trickles down his forehead in response. Yet, even with that he doesn’t snap out of his eccentric behavior. Now, he’s started to scratch his head with <em>both</em> hands.</p>

<p>「? Gone mad?」</p>

<p>How troublesome. While consulting Fran about whether we should flee or kill, his subordinate steps forward.</p>

<p>「Now, now, Sir Auguste. Leave this to me.」<br>
「<em>Gu-<strong>gununu…</strong></em>」<br>
「I’ll only punish them a bit.」<br>
「Is t-that so? T-Then I’ll leave it to you. <em>Hihihi</em>.」</p>

<p>What an unpleasant face to laugh with… Since his mind seems to have snapped, there’s just no way to go about fixing him, huh?</p>

<p>「And so: hand over the magic sword. That’s an order from the Viscount.」<br>
「No way.」<br>
「<em>Kukuku</em>… Rather than resorting to violence, quickly handing it over is better for you, don’t you think?」<br>
「T-That’s r-right! Gyuran is a master Mercenary!」<br>
「Understand that? If you do, hand over the sword.」<br>
「Not. A. Chance.」<br>
「<em>Tsk</em>. Shitty brat, don’t get all conceited, a’right! Can’t you e’en comprehend th’ difference in our abilities?」</p>

<p>Well, let’s just see how strong this gum-flapping Gyuran really is.</p>

<p>So-so, I guess? He’s not a small fry, but he’s not powerful by any means. As a ‘master mercenary’, he’s quite lacking.</p>

<p>「Hm? You… Are you a Black Cat?」<br>
「…」<br>
「My <em>esteemed</em> self is from the Blue Cat Tribe. Could it be that you detest me?」<br>
「Blue Cat Tribe: the enemy.」</p>

<p>Fran gives off a strong feeling of hostility as those words leave her mouth.</p>

<p>『Fran? What is going on?』<br>
（Blue Cat Tribe: have lots of slave merchants. Black marketeers as well.）<br>
『Like the ones who caught Fran…?』</p>

<p>This man might also be related to such things. He has Commerce, Threaten and Capture after all.</p>

<p>（Mhm. Around 300 years ago: the Blue Cat Tribe started becoming slave traders. Tricked members of the Black Cat tribe. Made into slaves and sold.）<br>
『’Tricked’?』<br>
（Blue Cat tribe pretended to be friendly, then launched a surprise attack. Many of the Black Cat tribe: caught and sold. Appealed to the King of the Beastmen, but because of status: couldn’t receive an audience.）</p>

<p>What a despicable story… I’ll remember it. The Blue Cat Tribe consists of slave traders. Fran’s enemy is my enemy. In other words, that guy is my enemy.</p>

<p>「What’s with you, finally going silent? Are ya trembling? Well, it’s too late now<em>kahaha</em>. You’ll have to experience a bit of pain: lament your own recklessness! I won’t give you any big wounds, though. You’d be unable to be turned into merchandise if I did!」<br>
『He’s pitch black. This fellow is definitely connected to the black market slave dealers.』<br>
（Nn.）</p>

<p>The man drew his blades, both of which were clad in magical power. They seem to be somewhat strong.</p>

<p>（All over his body: magic tools?）<br>
『Yeah, looks like it.』<br>
（Then, take?）<br>
『Using Dimensional Storage?』</p>

<p>Wouldn’t harvesting the opponent’s equipment during battle be effective? We’d been thinking so for a while now, — No, actually, we only noticed we could recently.</p>

<p>Originally, we tried various things to test the power of the Dimensional Storage. Tests to see if the passage of time <em>truly</em> stopped, or if the temperature <em>really</em> didn’t change among others. The results of our investigation showed that the raw materials didn’t rot, and foods stayed piping hot. After testing regularly, we came to the conclusion that time really stopped.</p>

<p>In the middle of such tests, we suddenly came up with the idea of stealing equipment from opponents. Since we had only been fighting Demonic Beasts there was no chance to try it out, but… The perfect opponent has arrived.</p>

<p>「Oh? You got the guts for it, lil’ girl?」</p>

<p>Fran unsheathes me… And Gyuran falls to the ground.</p>

<p>「――Huh?」<br>
「First: bracelets.」<br>
「<em><strong>AAAAAAAAAAAH</strong></em>!」</p>

<p>Moving to his side in an instant, Gyuran’s arms both fall to Fran’s feet. On each arm was a magic bracelet.</p>

<p>（Teacher: harvesting went well?）<br>
『Y-Yeah.』</p>

<p>No mercy for enemies, right? Or rather, it seems that her actions are slightly more severe than usual, with a calm anger resonating around her. Towards the screaming Gyuran, Fran’s eyes grow dark as she pushes me against the bracelets. With that, Dimensional Storage invoked.</p>

<p>「Sword, too.」</p>

<p>I retrieve the fallen sword without issue. It seems that I can harvest things so long as they’re separated from the wielder’s hand.</p>

<p>「W-Why?! According to my Skill, she shouldn’t be this strong — O-Only my life, plea<em>aa<strong>aaah</strong>!</em>」</p>

<p>Skills? This guy can talk quite well despite being in such a state… Ah, come to think of it, he had a Pain Reduction Skill. Is it thanks to that? Now, what were his other skills again…? <em>Ahh</em>, I see, he was talking about Strong Presence Perception!</p>

<pre><strong>Strong Presence Perception</strong> 
Allows the user to perceive the difference in Levels between themselves and others.</pre>

<p>So, it’s because of this Skill that he figured Fran’s Level was below his. A member of the Black Cat tribe with a lower level, and a young girl on top of that. In his eyes, there must have been plenty to make light of.</p>

<p><em>Hmm</em>… Besides Strong Presence Perception, AGI ↑ is a good skill, but… Skill Taker can’t be reused in the end. As expected, it’s absolutely necessary to think before we use it. Hopefully a good opponent will arrive in front of us while Skill Taker is usable.</p>

<p>「Attempt harvesting again. Armor?」<br>
「<em>H-Hiii―!</em>」</p>

<p><em>*Zaku*</em></p>

<p>I jab into the shoulder of the man who is trying to flee by crawling away.</p>

<p>「<em>I-It huuurts!</em>」</p>

<p>Even if he has Pain Reduction, there’s no way this would remain painless in the end. While thinking so I invoke Dimensional storage, but…</p>

<p>『I can’t harvest it. It appears that it’s not possible to take anything that the other party is wearing.』</p>

<p>How disappointing. If it was possible, it would have been quite useful during combat.</p>

<p>（Then… If the wielder dies it’ll work?）<br>
『Well, that’s right, but… I’ll do it, so ―』<br>
（Nn-nn. It’s alright. I will.）</p>

<p>Uttering so, Fran swings me down without hesitation.</p>

<p>「<em>Ag―― kahyuu――……</em>」</p>

<p>With the nape of his neck cut, the sound of air escaping his lungs releases from his lips. As his life fade, he squirms slightly, moving what remains of his arms midair… <em>And dies.</em> Not quick enough.</p>

<p>『Are you alright?』<br>
（Would have been experienced eventually. This guy as the first: good luck.）</p>

<p>For having killed a person with her own hands for the first time, she’s quite calm. Perhaps it was because he was a bitter enemy of her tribe, or maybe it was because he was a scoundrel?</p>

<p>Well, the Mental Stability Skill might also be showing its effect. It’s a skill that lowers the mental hurdle towards killing, so… It’s good that she obtained it before this experience.</p>

<p>Anyways, I can rationalize it all I’d like, but it’d be best to ignore it for now. So long as Fran doesn’t end up troubled for no reason, then it’s fine. I never liked hesitant protagonists anyways. To get depressed every single time they kill an enemy is nothing but irritating.</p>

<p>『Then, let’s harvest it at once!』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
『First, the armor!』</p>

<p>Armor, Boots, Dagger, Shield, Gauntlets, Necklace, one by one they get harvested.</p>

<p>「<em>Hihihihihiii!</em>」</p>

<p>It was uncertain whether it was a laugh or a scream that was raised as Small-Fry Vice Commander Auguste fell on his backside.</p>

<p>「Ri… Ri-Ridiculous! H-He was the hero of the Ruze War! T-To defeat the slaughterer of a th-thousand men, that s-superhuman, th-this easily…!」</p>

<p>He really was completely fooled… Slaughterer of a thousand men? That’s just too laughable. Besides, this Gyuran: a Hero? No way. Anyone with even a <em>spec</em> of human intellect could realize that. It’s difficult to believe that someone would fall for such a lie.</p>

<p>No, maybe… Is this my fault? Since I stole Law of Lies, has he become unable to distinguish truth from lies?</p>

<p>（Teacher’s fault.）<br>
『<em>Eh…</em> So it is, after all…』<br>
（Nn. Good job.）<br>
『Ah, you were praising me.』</p>

<p>She’s harsh on those she’s showed hostility to, as usual.</p>

<p>W-Well, you reap what you sow. It’s just his bad luck that he picked a quarrel with us. Right. I’m not at fault. Nope.</p>

<p>「A-And Gyuran’s equipment, w-where did it go?! I-I bought t-that as a present — i-it’s the highest grade of armor!」</p>

<p>You really were an easy mark, huh. After being inspired with a bunch of lies, you easily opened your wallet. How pitiful.</p>

<p>『Hey, what should we do about him?』<br>
（…… Ignore.）<br>
『<em>Hmm</em>. Is that alright?』</p>

<p>For now, I guess we’ll just focus on harvesting Gyuran’s corpse. If it’s left alone, it seem that he could become an undead, after all. It’s a bother to have to dispose of it, but it can’t be helped.</p>

<p>While we’re at it, I take the ~20,000 Gorudo he had on him, too. Can’t let anything go to waste, right?</p>

<p>Now, how should we deal with Auguste… Arrest him? Kill him? Ignore him? Brainwash him?</p>

<p>While being troubled about how to approach the issue, a new presence appeared, closing in on our location.</p>

<p>（Teacher…!）<br>
『<em>Ah</em>, it’s got quite the amount of magical power. It might just reach Threat Level D! Be careful!』<br>
「Nn!」</p>

                    <br>

        <h1>Chapter 44: After What Occurred</h1>

<p><code>Mllhild:</code><br>
I’ve got to apologize to Ensig and the readers. I had so much free time and just kept procrastinating until I noticed that Monday had already passed. I will try to manage my time better to prevent that from happening again.</p>

<p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p>（Teacher…!）<br>
『Ah, it’s got quite the amount of magical power. It might just reach Threat Level D! Be careful!』<br>
「Nn!」</p>

<p>Despite my approximation, whatever’s approaching has a <em>peculiar</em> magical power. It’s not the same as a Demonic Beast’s, Human’s, or… Well, <em>anything’s</em>. Really, it’s quite a strange magic power.</p>

<p>And that enigmatic presence is coming towards us at frightening speed. Perhaps it’s aiming at Fran? No, the idiot Viscount still counts as a Noble, so maybe he’s the target?</p>

<p>Well, anyway, this is no time to be careless.</p>

<p>「W-Why is your sword still drawn?! D-Do you intend to kill me?!」</p>

<p>For some reason Auguste is being noisy. Thinking about it, it’d be bothersome if he became a hindrance during the fight, so let’s have him be quiet for now. Lv3 Dark Magic: 『Mind・Lost』. It’s a spell that steals the target’s consciousness, causing them to faint. My guess is that this guy won’t have any resistance.</p>

<p>「Ah…….?」</p>

<p><em>*thmp*</em></p>

<p>Moving the collapsed Viscount to the side, we remain waiting for a few tens of seconds, and what showed itself was a strange half-translucent thing. How to describe it… It’s like a water sphere that keeps winding and changing its form while floating in the air.</p>

<p>「Miss Fran, you haven’t killed him, right?」<br>
「?」</p>

<p>Suddenly, it started talking. Wait, it’s not guaranteed that it’s <em>actually </em>talking, as there isn’t any evidence of it having a mouth — let alone a face. Still, I <em>think</em> that it’s talking. Its voice seems familiar, too.</p>

<p>「Guild Master?」<br>
「That’s right. Ah, is this your first time seeing one of these? This is one of the kinds of Spirits I use. Please, be at ease.」<br>
「Spirit… First time seeing one.」</p>

<p>It’s also my first time coming across something like this. How should I say this… It’s a bit different from what I imagined. I had thought that Spirits would have a more humanoid appearance — something like a Sylph or an Undine.</p>

<p>It seem Fran was thinking along similar lines.</p>

<p>「Somehow, strange」<br>
「What is strange! To call it strange… This child is an Intermediate level Spirit, therefore is has no human appearance. However, this child is also cute by all means you know!]<br>
「Cuter ones: better.」<br>
「The ones with humanoid appearances are Superior Spirits. There is no <em>way</em>someone would summon such a being for anything other than combat.」</p>

<p>Ah, so Spirits with humanoid appearance are Superior Spirits. Furthermore, the Guild Master is able to summon ones like that. This one’s only an Intermediate level, but it already has a lot of magical power, so just how powerful would a superior one be, I wonder?</p>

<p>If he can have several Spirits summoned simultaneously, then he’s quite the force to be reckoned with… The Guild Master is already tremendously strong all by himself, so with the addition of Spirits, wouldn’t it be a bit out of hand? Well, I guess that’s to be expected from a Guild Master.</p>

<p>「What did you want?」<br>
「Oops, that’s right. I received information that Viscount Auguste left the town chasing after you.」</p>

<p>That only just happened… He has some pretty good ears.</p>

<p>「The gatekeeper, Sir Dert, kindly notified me. It was something along the lines of ‘Viscount Auguste went out chasing after her, will she be alright?’.」</p>

<p>Dert, I’m sorry for having thought that you might be a lolicon. You were just a good person.</p>

<p>「Nn. He appeared.」<br>
「As I thought! An appeal to the Guild came in about securing the Viscount behind the scenes. You didn’t kill him, right? Right? Erm, maybe you <em>accidentally</em>killed him? That sure would be troublesome!」<br>
「Didn’t kill.」<br>
「R-Really? Good! Then, I’d like to take him off your hands. Of course, you won’t be handing him over for free.」<br>
「Okay.」<br>
「Really? Thank you! Well then, I will immediately make my way towards your location, so could you guard him for the time being?」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「Then, excuse me!」</p>

<p>At with the Guild Master’s words, the Spirit’s figure disappeared. It seems that it was used in place of a messenger.</p>

<p>10 minutes later, the figure of the Guild Master appeared. Pretty fast. Seem like he put quite a bit of effort into coming out here.</p>

<p>「Miss Fran, thank you for waiting.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「Viscount Augusto is… Ah, there he is. Hey, over here.」</p>

<p>The Adventurers the Guild Master brought along lifted the Viscount up and carried him off.</p>

        </div>
        

<p>「Where will he go?」<br>
「Ah, to the source of the request: Count Olmës.」</p>

<p>That’s a name I haven’t heard yet. Who is he?</p>

<p>「Count Olmës is Viscounts Auguste’s esteemed father.」<br>
「Father detaining his child?」<br>
「Yes. I would like this to remain between just us, but from the start Viscount Auguste had a problematic personality. Still, for the sake of possessing the Law of Lies Skill, Count Olmës didn’t punish him, but instead used him.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「However… A few days ago, the Skill suddenly vanished. The reason is unknown, as it’s quite an unusual situation. Well, it’s possible that because he only used his Skill for worthless things, one of the Gods punished him.」</p>

<p><em>Hmmmm</em>, he was given a punishment alright. Therefore, it’d be fine to be seen like that.</p>

<p>「Anyways, how he ended up after losing the Skill left even me astonished. He was the type to use the Skill to distinguish truth from lies with whoever he met, so when it was lost, it appears he became unable to trust anyone anymore.」</p>

<p>I see. If a Skill you had since birth was lost, then what would become of you? In his case, he became distrustful of other humans. Well, it wasn’t that simple, of course. It was more along the lines of completely breaking.</p>

<p>I had only thought that I obtained a convenient Skill, but… I should refrain from using it as much as possible. I don’t want to become like the foolish viscount. Thinking that I’d be alright so long as I had that Skill… I’m not special enough for something like that to become reality.</p>

<p>「A few days prior to the discovery he also caused problems towards members of the Royal House, who were visiting for an inspection. Disregarding all semblances of etiquette, he grabbed at them and started shouting not to tell lies in front of an audience.」</p>

<p><em>Uwaa…</em> That’s terrible. No, wait… We also stole the Court Etiquette Skill, didn’t we? Did that also…?</p>

<p>「And, while under house arrest, he slipped out of his room and hid himself. On that occasion, it seems that he took quite the sum of money with him… Most of it, he apparently used. We tracked his spending all the way to the place he bought some expensive armor.」</p>

<p>In all likelihood, that was done under the influence of Gyuran. Then, after catching Fran he intended to abandon Aressa and escape… As if this idiotic noble would be able to pull that off.</p>

<p>「In Count Olmës case, he doesn’t want this ordeal to breed a large commotion. And so, before Viscount Auguste made any more commissions, he came requesting to have him secured in secret.]<br>
「Secret?」<br>
「Correct. This is my personal opinion, but I believe he’s concealed the fact that his son lost the Skill and plans to make use of it in some way. Whether he plans on directly manipulating him, or perhaps plans on using some manner of medical treatment to get the Skill back remains to be seen, but… For the time being, he wants to restrain the Viscount. And so, as to prevent the exposure of this incident, the Count wanted to proceed with the highest possible degree of secrecy. It’s something along this lines.」</p>

<p><em>Hm Hmm…</em> So in other words<em>…</em> Hush money has been prepared?</p>

<p>「<em>*Jiiー*</em>」<br>
「…… Don’t stare so much. You have the privilege of having this treated as an accomplished commission with a bonus properly added on top.」<br>
「Nn. Of course.」<br>
「In exchange… You already know, right?」<br>
「Mouth: sealed.」</p>

<p>Towards the suddenly nodding, seemingly self-confident Fran the Guild Master directed a strangely uneasy gaze.</p>

<p>「<em>Haa</em>. Truly, I beg of you: keep it a secret. The other party is a powerful Noble after all. If he’s angered various troubles are sure to follow.」</p>

<p>We also want to be spared from being dragged into the family troubles of Nobility. Even if we weren’t asked, there’s no way we’d go around spreading rumors.</p>

<p>「Well, in regards to the Viscount’s personal effects I was told there was no need to recover them, so don’t worry.」</p>

<p>It seems that it’s been concluded that we plundered the equipment alongside and a large sum of money. Er, it’s a bit different, you know?</p>

<p>… It seems our debt towards the Guild Master has increased.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we made the decision to keep Fran’s name from the Count. For such a powerful Noble, I doubt he’d have interest in the name of a commoner. It’d be really unlikely, right? Still, this is just in case.</p>

<p>By the way, the commission fee alongside the hush money added up to 200,000<sub>Gorudo</sub>, so all of a sudden our money doubled.</p>

<p>As one would expect of a Noble’s commission. Their sense of money must be strange indeed.</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 45: Return of the A Rank</h1>

<p>We’ve gone to the Guild again today.</p>

<p>In the last few days a lot has happened, but the unchanging days have started up again. Frankly, there’s not enough excitement. If there were good commissions it’d be alright, but… Well, you know.</p>

<p>『There are only Rank C requests with a large amount of working hours…』<br>
（Again: medical plants gathering?）<br>
『I’ve also had enough of that, you know~?』</p>

<p>There’s still a whole week before we receive the armor from old man Gallus. In the meantime, what should we — hm?</p>

<p>As Fran opens the door to the Guild, we find it unusually noisy on the inside.</p>

<p>「Nell. What happened?」<br>
「Right, Fran doesn’t know. I wonder if you haven’t met yet?」<br>
「?」<br>
「Well, after finishing the investigation of Maokami Plains, the Rank A and B Adventurers have returned.」<br>
「There’re Rank A’s?」<br>
「Yep. In our guild, there’s a single Rank A Adventurer, and 10 B’s. Around one month ago they left for the investigation of the Maokami Plains. Other than them, no less than 15 people of Rank C to F accompanied them to gain experience. It’s thanks to that the Goblin Subjugation became a big deal.]</p>

<p>Indeed. If there had been A and B Rank Adventurers then the situation could have been settled far easier. In fact, there’d be a high chance that a few elite would have been picked out to capture it.</p>

<p>However, in that case we wouldn’t have been able to bring down the Demon, so for us having them return now rather than then was lucky.</p>

<p>『And I had thought that Donna was the strongest…』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「What’s the matter?」<br>
「Donna wasn’t strongest.」<br>
「Mr. Donnadorondo is skilled at teaching, so he holds the teaching position. In addition, if he had continued to serve in active duty he certainly would have been B Rank by now, you know? However, saying that he wanted to commit himself to the next generation, he became an instructor. It’s already been 15 years since he took that position, so over half of Aressa’s B and C ranks were taught by him, you know? Because of that, most Adventurers listen to Mr. Donnadorondo.」</p>

<p>It was also for that connection that Donna was at the front line of the Goblin Subjugation.</p>

<p>「The A Rank too?」<br>
「Ahh, that person is different. Or rather… That person listens to no one. Honestly, their personality is so overbearing that they’re difficult to handle, you know?」<br>
「My, my… Nell, are you speaking ill of me behind my back?」<br>
「<em>Kyaー</em>! Amanda! Don’t draw near while erasing your presence! It’s because you do stuff like that I said you’re difficult to handle!」<br>
「<em>Ufufu~</em> It’s good being hard to handle you know? I’m not a dog for running errands after all.」</p>

<p>Their words are harsh, but smiles are floating on both of their faces. Their relationship is good enough to freely bad mouth each other, I guess.</p>

<p>But anyways, she’s quite the beautiful woman. A slight Japanese-like air drifts about her black hair cut at the shoulders. She’s a gentle and tender type of beauty. Her voice also floats with a gentle feeling, ringing pleasantly in the ears.</p>

<p>However… The feeling I have after hearing her conversation is that her character is fairly stubborn.</p>

<p>「Let me introduce you, Fran. This is Amanda, our A Rank Adventurer as well as our ace. Well, she isn’t a bad person, and she’s fond of children. At any rate, her title is–」<br>
「<em>Wah–!</em> Stop it, Nell! That’s embarrassing!」<br>
「Why? It’s the <em>perfect</em> title for you.」<br>
「Oh, buzz off! — <em>Ohohoho</em>. Sorry for showing you something unsightly. It’s nice to meet you, little miss. I’m Amanda.」<br>
「Nn. Fran.」<br>
「Amazing… To such ability at such a young age… You’re quite promising~」<br>
「Do you see, Amanda?」<br>
「Naturally.」</p>

<p>That’s an A Rank Adventurer for you. To see through our strength after only looking at us a little. It doesn’t seem to be an Appraisal type Skill, however. Perhaps it’s simply her own ability built up through experience?</p>

<p>The title, ‘Guardian of Children’, must have been what Nell was alluding to. Is it a Title given to ones who like children, or…?</p>

<p>Well, anyways, she’s <em>strong</em>. I was astonished when I saw the Guild Master and Donna, but Amanda is on another level. Frankly, she’s quite terrifying. That is, this person could even go hunting for Demons.</p>

<p>There’s no point in going against her. No matter what manner of surprise attacks are set up, I just can’t see us claiming victory.</p>

<p>『She’s dangerous. <em>Never</em> go against her.』<br>
（Nn. Sure.）<br>
「The story of being the one to raise Ranks fastest since the founding of the guild, of course I’ve heard about it. A tiny, terribly cute, beautiful beastman Girl wielding a Magic Sword!」</p>

<p>Eh? I’m happy that Fran is being praised, but… Wasn’t there a bit too many references to her appearance? Who on earth described her like that! Where’s the bastard that looked at Fran with dirty eyes?!</p>

<p>「But, despite that the Guild Master said to not be careless. He said that if you’re fooled by her appearance then you’re in for a painful experience.」</p>

<p>Oi, Guild Master! What are you saying to an A rank adventurer?! — Well, if the Guild Master went 「Fran-chan, ＣＵＴＥ～」 it would probably be worse.</p>

<p>「Ah, right. Fran. The Guild Master was calling for you.」<br>
「He was? Fine if I go to the room?」<br>
「Please, if you could?」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「My, what a shame. I wanted to take her to eat, but with the Guild Master as my opponent, I’ll give up.」<br>
「Bye bye.」<br>
「<em>Kyaa~</em> cute~ I want a little sister like you!」<br>
「Amanda, just how old do you think you are? You’re mistaking ‘sister’ with ‘daughter’, don’t you think」<br>
「<strong><em>Ne~ll~?</em></strong> Just because you’re a bit young, there are good things and bad things to say, you know? Besides Half-Elves age slowly!」<br>
「Yes, yes. Right. Amanda is still young.」</p>

<p>They get really along well. Leaving behind Nell and Amanda messing around, Fran moves towards the Guild Master’s office.</p>

<p>◇◆◇</p>

<p><em>*Gan<strong>Gan</strong>Gan*</em></p>

<p>「Hey! Who is it! Such rude knocking!」</p>

<p><em>*Gacha*</em></p>

<p>「Came.」<br>
「Ah, it was Miss Fran. How should I say this… If you enter before admission is accepted from the inside, then there’s no point in knocking.」<br>
「<a href="http://squarefaction.ru/files/user/2961/storage/1332524330.png">Shocked</a>.」<br>
「<em>Haa…</em> Please be more careful next time.」</p>

<p>Sorry, Guild Master. I will firmly educate her.</p>

<p>「Called: why?」<br>
「To be frank, there’s a commission I earnestly want you to accept.」</p>

<p>A request from the Guild Master? There’s no way <em>not</em> to have a bad premonition, but still.</p>

<p>「There’re voices coming from in and outside the Guild holding your ability in question. Of course, I know that they’re unjustified, but from the perspective of someone who doesn’t know you personally there is no way for them to believe in your abilities. And so, to quiet those voices, won’t you take on a certain request?」</p>

<p>No no, the one who went around raising our Rank at his own convenience was<em>you</em>, you know? And now, you come to us with this?</p>

<p>「Ranked by you arbitrarily.」<br>
「Well, it hurts if you say it like that, but… Listen, there are more jealous folks sprouting up than expected. Furthermore, there are also voices advocating <em>for</em> you, which makes the situation grow worse. There are many rank D and C Rank Adventurers that have recognized you, understanding your power from experience on the field. It’s beginning to seem as though you’re popular because you’re a mascot.」</p>

<p>Adventurers from the intermediate level and above growing to respect her were expected, but… To think she was also being seen as a mascot…</p>

<p>「Among the lower ranked Adventurers, many don’t approve. There are also those who still haven’t been able to ascend from Rank E for a long time, so after seeing you being raised to rank D so easily, too many have gotten jealous.」<br>
「Leave them be.」<br>
「I would also like to leave it at that, but I simply can’t anymore. Some among them are spreading unfounded rumors like you bought your Rank with money, or that I have preferences for little girls and have been charmed by you.」</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">

        </div>
        

<p>For some reason, he’s begun muttering complaints.</p>

<p>「There is no way that I prefer little girls! Good grief, spare me <em>please</em>. To begin with I prefer ――」</p>

<p>This guy… Could it be that he just doesn’t like being called a lolicon, so he brought this up?</p>

<p>「Accepting: not compulsory?」<br>
「Now, now. If you say it like that, then there would be several bonuses attached, right?. Please, just hear me out at least.」</p>

<p>He’s desperate. Really, it only feels like he wants to deny the suspicions of him being a lolicon.</p>

<p>「The bonus added onto the commission fee is obvious, but there’ll also be an entrance permit for the Dungeon of the town of Urmut issued.」<br>
「…… How did you know?」<br>
「Well, if you request documents related to it in the Reference Room, even if you don’t want me to know I’ll end up knowing about it. For admission to the Dungeon your Adventurer Rank is certainly sufficient, but with that alone permission won’t be granted. In all likelihood, the person deciding will place their judgement — with the possibility of rejection — on the spot.」</p>

<p>Is that so… And for a lone, cute little beastkin girl, there’s definitely a chance we won’t pass. Furthermore, even if she does pass the process might take a while.</p>

<p>「If you have a permit, examinations are unneeded. You can immediately dive into the Dungeon.」</p>

<p>And, as a result, save time. <em>Tsk</em>, this clever Elf. He knows quite a bit about us, huh.</p>

<p>「… For now: I’ll hear you out.」<br>
「Thank you very much. Well then, the commission is this one.」</p>

<p>Essentially, the commission is an investigation request for the Dungeon in Aressa.</p>

<p>「A Dungeon in Aressa? First time heard about it.」<br>
「It’s a dungeon that has already been captured, but it’s usually not open to the public. Every few months, the Guild carries out a survey.」<br>
「Captured, yet: investigation?」<br>
「The Dungeon Core is still in one piece, after all. If you have the core, then a small amount of manipulation is possible… It’s only to the degree of being able to spawn certain Demonic Beasts using the spawning settings, and creating items though. In addition, those can only be made so long as they’re within the range of the Core’s magical power. Because of all that, Aressa’s Dungeon is limited to the production of Demonic Beast with at most Rank F, alongside only a handful of items.」</p>

<p>With that, it isn’t profitable at all. Were it possible to simply create high-level Potions or Demonic Beast with rare ingredients, then it would give birth to amazing profits.</p>

<p>「And if the Core amasses a lot of magical power?」<br>
「If that was possible then we wouldn’t have to go through so many hardships. We had assembled several dozens of human magicians to channeled their power into the core, but even with that there wasn’t much change.」<br>
「Then, how does it store magical power?」<br>
「The core drains it from veins within the ground, the atmosphere, and apparently from any Demonic Beasts and Adventurers inside of the Dungeon. In addition, even if it isn’t much, Dungeon Masters have other means of filling it with magical power. Otherwise, the maintenance of the labyrinth would be impossible」</p>

<p>Vast amounts of magical power should be necessary to summon things like a Demon normally, after all.</p>

<p>「Therefore, it’s important for Demonic Beasts to inhabit the dungeon. If they don’t, then magical power isn’t accumulated, and to a certain degree the Core can’t do its work. As for Aressa’s dungeon, it’s set up to generate items at periodic intervals. The request also includes the retrieval of those.」<br>
「Subjugating the Demonic Beasts: alright?」<br>
「It doesn’t matter. They’d multiply again soon enough. Rather, thinning them out so they don’t become too numerous is also part of the job. If left alone for too long, evolutions might occur… And that would be dangerous.」</p>

<p>The completion fee is quite good, too. There’s just one problem, though. That is, in the details 「For several Parties」 is written. To work together with idiots like the ones who attacked us: no thank you.</p>

<p>「Ah, in regards to the parties, arrangements have already been made.」<br>
「What types of people?」<br>
「This commission serves simultaneously as a Rank Up examination to Rank D, so at present 9 Rank E adventurers are divided into 2 Parties, and a 3-person Rank C Party serves as the examiner. I can pledge for their background, but for their nature… You’ll have to confirm for yourself.」</p>

<p>I’d hate to cast the request away, but… What shall we do? We’re fine even if we don’t take it, after all.</p>

<p>「Next, in the case you accept the commission I would need to receive a written Oath.」<br>
「Written Oath?」<br>
「Oath Magic makes it possible to bind a target through a written pledge.」<br>
「Like a Contract?」<br>
「Yes. However, in contrast to a Contract which is from one person to another, a written vow is able bind several. In exchange, the bond is frail.」<br>
「Hm.」<br>
「The content of the vow would be barring the disclosure of the request’s contents. In the case this Oath is violated, your Guild Card would contain a remark about your violation. At worst, measures of decreasing one’s Rank, or even Expulsion would occur.」</p>

<p>Oath Magic, huh? Somehow, it gives me a bad feeling. Binding someone through magic, no matter what it’s for, reminds me of slavery.</p>

<p>『Fran. What now?』<br>
「Nnー?」</p>

<p>When Fran showed a troubled expression the Guild Master, somewhat panicked, placed a small bag on the table.</p>

<p>「Now, now. I put a personal bonus for you as well, so…」</p>

<p><em>Hmm</em>. A personal bonus from the guild master, huh? From that we can expect something, but…</p>

<p>「Please, take a look.」</p>

<p>As he turns the bag upside down, around 20 magic stones roll out.</p>

<p>「These are?」<br>
「Something like my secret savings. They are magic stones I obtained while I was still in active duty, and each one of them is from a Demonic Beast of Threat Level D or above.」</p>

<p>So it seems. Selling the magic stones would be fine, but they can also be used for producing armor. In other words, this reward is better than gold.</p>

<p>Still, the Guild Master’s eyes seem as though they’re probing for something… Did he realize that we desired magical stones? Fran doesn’t sell her magic stones, so perhaps he’s begun suspecting us of something based off of that?</p>

<p>「Why magic stones?」<br>
「Well? Are they to your liking?」</p>

<p>If anything imprudent is said here, I have a hunch that our side will gain the disadvantage. Of course, even if it’s exposed that we desire magic stones, the purpose will still be unknown. With that in mind, we ought to finish it here.</p>

<p>「Not bad.」<br>
「Right?」<br>
（How about Teacher?）<br>
『I’m sorry to say, but I don’t know what Skills they hold. At best, I’m able to know which Demonic Beasts they’re from. The extent of their magic power is also hard to guess.』</p>

<p>Even so, the ones the Guild Master placed in front of us are certainly good magic stones. Threat Level D was on the same level as the Blast Tortoise and the Doppel Snake, after all. Still, to compulsorily undergo Oath Magic is a bit…</p>

<p>「From these, I will present you with whichever two you’d like. How about that?」<br>
「Hmm… For ten: I’ll accept.」<br>
「Wha– As you would expect, that is–! Three!」<br>
「Nine.」<br>
「Hey, that will go on with 4, 8, 5, 7 and in the end, won’t this pattern raise it to 6?! No way! Four stones. I won’t yield more than that.」<br>
「Then: decline.」<br>
「<em>Gu…</em>」<br>
「Five. Paid in advance.」<br>
「<em>Mumu…</em>」<br>
「Good bye.」<br>
「A-Alright……!」</p>

<p>Oh, good job Fran! To corner this Guild Master!</p>

<p>「In exchange for them, I’ll be counting on you for afore-mentioned matter.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「I’ve heard all about it!」</p>

<p>Without warning, the door is flung open and Amanda storms into the room. The same entrance pattern as Auguste. Is the security of this room even remotely alright? Even as a joke, it’s still supposed to be the Guild Masters room.</p>

<p>But, well, that’s an A Rank Adventurer for you. I couldn’t feel her presence at all.</p>

<p>「Let me borrow this for a moment!」</p>

<p>Amanda quickly snapped the documents the Guild Master placed in front of him and started reading. What an audacious woman! And yet, even with her attitude, the Guild Master isn’t saying anything.</p>

<p>「I thought so! For the accompanying Adventurers… Won’t there only be men?!」</p>

<p>Well, there’s no helping it. Even if you say that there aren’t any girls coming along, it’s only because there are so few female Adventures. The ratio is around 20 to 1, I think? If you consider that, then it’s not strange for there to be no woman among the 12 people coming along.</p>

<p>「Among males reeking of sweat, the cute little Fran would be all alone… There’s no way I could permit such a thing! Therefore, I will be going with her on this commission!」<br>
「No. Furthermore, there is already someone with a suitable Rank that will be acting as–」<br>
「I will be going with her!」<br>
「…… I understand.」</p>

<p>To talk down to the Guild Master with such vigor… The Guild Master probably noticed that no matter what he said, it would have been useless.</p>

<p>「Miss Fran, are you also alright with that?」<br>
「Nn. No problem.」</p>

                    <br>

        <h1>Chapter 46: Introductions</h1>

<p><code>Ensig:</code><br>
Just a note: Mllhild has stepped down as the Translator for Sword-shisho. That being the case, it’s back to just me with sporadic releases. Best regards (again).</p>

<p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p>It’s been one hour since we received the request from the Guild Master.</p>

<p>We’ve returned to the inn.</p>

<p>『Then, shall I absorb the Magic Stones?』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
『I wonder what kind of Skills we’ll get…』<br>
「Anticipating.」<br>
『Thinking about it, this is a bit like a grab-bag, huh.』<br>
「Grab-bag?」<br>
『Ahh, how should I put it… A grab-bag is a bag filled with hopes, dreams, and a bit of despair.』<br>
「Somehow: amazing.」<br>
『Many brave men have challenged such bags for items of favor, only to meet a terrible fate.』<br>
「Has Teacher seen one before?」<br>
『Well…』<br>
「Amazing!」</p>

<p>Well, before I make a fool out of myself, let’s use absorb the magic stone.</p>

<p>Thanks to Demonic Beast Knowledge, I can see the stones’ Ranks just fine. With 5 stones total, 3 are D Rank, and 2 are C Rank.</p>

<p>The D Ranks come from a <strong>Fortress Hermit Crab</strong>, a <strong>Sea Lion</strong>, and a <strong>Trident Shark</strong>. I had chosen Demonic Beasts of the sea since we hadn’t actually seen the ocean yet.</p>

<p>As for the 2 C Rank magic stones, one is from a <strong>Red Colossus</strong>, and one is from an<strong>Old Yeti</strong>.</p>

<p>「First: D Rank.」<br>
『<em>Mhh!</em> Here we go!』</p>

<pre>Fortress Hermit Crab　Magic Stone Status：39
Hunger Resistance：Lv1, Water Pressure Resistance：Lv1, Underwater Respiration：Lv1, Weight Reduction</pre>

<pre>Sea Lion　Magic Stone Status：79
Swimming：Lv1, Current Manipulation：Lv1, Water Bullet Discharge：Lv1</pre>

<pre>Trident Shark　Magic Stone Status：43
Underwater Acoustics：Lv1, Current Jet：Lv1, Competitive Swimming：Lv1</pre>

<p>We obtained quite the variety. We’ve attained an extensive set of water-based Skills, just as planned. Next is the well-awaited C Rank stones.</p>

<p>「<em>Ha!</em>」</p>

<p>The Magic Stone thrown into the sky by Fran is cut in two through in one stroke by me. <em>Uoー</em>, it came, it came! After a long time, the sense of absorbing big-game has come!</p>

<pre>Red Colossus　Magic Stone Status：196
Frenzy：Lv1, Heat Resistance：Lv1, Weight Increase, STR ↑</pre>

<pre>Old Yeti　Magic Stone Status：127
Cold Resistance：Lv1, Poison Knowledge：Lv1, Ice Resistance：Lv1, INT ↑ Low</pre>

<p>With these, a long-awaited Rank Up will occur! Prior to absorbing the 5 stones, my status looked like this:</p>

<pre>ATK：434　Retained MP：2050/2050　Durability：1850/1850 
Magical Power Conductivity・A
 
Skills: 
Self-Evolution〈Rank 8・Magic Stone Status: 3146/3600・Memory: 70・Points: 2〉</pre>

<p>And now, it’s like this:</p>

<pre>Name：Teacher 
Equipment Registration：Fran 
Race：Intelligent Weapon 

ATK：478　Retained MP：2500/2500　Durability：2300/2300 
Magical Power Conductivity・A 

Skills: 
Self-Evolution〈Rank 9・Magic Stone Status: 3630/4500・Memory: 79・Points: 47〉</pre>

<p><em>Alright, alright!</em> With this, I can tweak my Skills yet again. This time, Superior Skills are the things on my mind. I couldn’t afford to tamper with it before, but I’d like to make use of it.</p>

<p>And so, my eyes are fixed on Sword Arts LvMax. When I make it a Superior Skill, will it simply become Master Sword Arts, or will it become a completely unknown Skill? If it does become Master Sword Arts not much will change in terms of sword-fighting, but what would happen to Sword Techniques? If its supporting skill Sword Arts disappears, would Sword Techniques even be usable? Or, because I have Master Sword Arts, would it work without an issue?</p>

<p>The chance to find out has arrived. Even if the worst occurs, there’re many Goblins that carry Sword Arts, and with Self-Evolution Points, bringing it back to LvMax isn’t really an issue.</p>

<p>『During this commission, we should be able to secure a magic stone from a Sword Arts carrier!』<br>
「<em>Oohー</em>」</p>

<p>◇◆◇</p>

<p>It’s been two days since that was said. We’ve once again returned to the Adventurers Guild.</p>

<p>「Now then, let’s take this chance to introduce ourselves. My name is Cruz. I’m the leader of the C Rank party『Azure Guard』 to which these two, Rigg and Izel, are members of. For this commission, I’ll be acting as your instructor as well as your examiner.」</p>

<pre>Name：Cruz Liuzel 　Age：28 
Race：Human 
Job：Blink Swordsman 
State：Normal 

Status:　Level：33 
HP：256　MP：175　STR：113　END：119　AGI：178　INT：80　MGC：91　DEX：119 

Skills: 
Malice Perception：Lv3, Stealth：Lv2, Evasion：Lv5, Court Etiquette：Lv3, Presence Perception：Lv4, Sword Techniques：Lv5, Sword Arts：Lv7, Self-Defense Arts：Lv4, Leadership：Lv2, Instantaneous Movement：Lv7, Cold Resistance：Lv4, Poison Resistance：Lv5, Trap Perception：Lv2, Vigor Manipulation 

Titles: 
Righteous 

Equipment: 
Mithril Longsword of Flame, Light-Silver Steel Armor, Light-Silver Steel Gauntlets, Light-Silver Steel Greaves, Cloak of One Hundred Spiders, Bracelet of Poison Resistance</pre>

<p>He’s an Ikeman. A blonde-haired Ikeman. An Ikeman that’s C Rank despite his young age, and judging by his white-and-shiny equipment he’s probably loaded. Furthermore, he has a family name, meaning he probably comes from an aristocratic home. His very facial features seem to emanate a feeling of nobility. Undoubtedly, this man is popular! <em>Tch!</em></p>

<p>Aside from that, he has the Righteous Title. With that in mind, he doesn’t seem like a bad person… So I’ll refrain from cursing him for now. If he goes after Fran, it’ll be an instant death, however!</p>

<p>「I use the Sword as my weapon. Please treat me well.」</p>

<p>Although the abilities between C Ranks should be roughly equivalent, he’s weaker than Donna. Or rather, I should probably see Donna as top-class among C Ranks.</p>

<p>In terms of Status, his two comrades are similar to him. Rigg is a user of Water Magic, while Izel seems to be something like a Scout-oriented Thief. Although they give off completely different feelings than Cruz, their relationship seems to be good. They must have been picked quite skillfully.</p>

<p>「From the E Rank party 『Roar of the Dragon』, m’ name’s Clad: the leader. My forté is the Spear. With us ‘ere, this Dungeon exploration’ll be finished in no time!」</p>

<p>Clad has spiky gray hair and suntanned skin, and behind him several Yankee-like youths raise their voices. His height is most likely more than 180<sub>cm</sub>.</p>

<pre>Name：Clad 　Age：23 
Race：Human 
Job：Warrior 
State：Normal 

Status:　Level：20 
HP：127　MP：97　STR：67　END：56　AGI：47　INT：50　MGC：46　DEX：42 

Skills: 
Transportation：Lv2, Balancing Act：Lv4, Danger Perception：Lv3, Hunger Resistance：Lv3, Pugilist Arts：Lv1, Spear Techniques：Lv1, Spear Arts：Lv4, Threatening：Lv3, Climbing：Lv3, Vigor Manipulation 

Titles: 
None 

Equipment: 
High-Quality Steel Spear, Plate Armor of the Rock Ox, Vambraces of the Rock Ox, Boots of the Giant Spider, Overcoat of the Stone Spider, Bracelet of Self-Healing・Low</pre>

<p>It seems that the condition to raise to Rank D is only whether or not you can use Techniques, so while he’s not particularly strong, Rank E’s should be at about his skill level. As for the four other members of his party, they have similar Spear-related skills. There doesn’t seem to be a lot of flexibility, but they’re probably strong when working together. Or… That’s the impression I have, anyways.</p>

<p>From what I’ve seen, Rank C’s are usually around Level 35, Rank D’s are about Level 25, Rank E’s are around Level 15, and Rank F’s are only about Level 10; Rank G’s are even lower. That’s more or less how the ranks’ level-zones are.</p>

<p>There <em>are</em> exceptions to that, however. For example, the former Mercenaries that picked a fight with Fran and were exterminated. Their levels were ~15, but their abilities didn’t match up. Judging by their low Skill levels, they likely power-leveled just to seem strong.</p>

<p>Viscount Auguste is a similar case. Even though he was Level 30 — about Rank C in equivalency — he would probably lose against an E Rank in a fight.</p>

<p>In that respect, Clad is quite good. His status is definitely one that would allow him to step foot into the grounds of Rank D.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>That being said, his personality doesn’t seem to be all that great. He’s been looking at Fran all this time, so chances are he thinks that the lovely little Fran is out of her mind for participating.</p>

<p>「I’m Frion, leader of the E Rank party:『Eyes of the Forest』. I’m not very good with weapons, but I can use Spirit Magic to compensate.」</p>

<p>A blond, thin-eyed Elf. There’s no other way to describe him. He seems a bit younger than the Guild Master.</p>

<pre>Name：Frion 　Age：49 
Race：Wood Elf 
Job：Spirit User 
State：Normal 

Status　Level：26 
HP：71　MP：233　STR：36　END：34　AGI：60　INT：91　MGC：111　DEX：69 

Skills: 
Archery：Lv1, Harvesting：Lv2, Cultivation：Lv4, Evil Perception：Lv3, Nature Magic：Lv3, Plant Knowledge：Lv7, Drowsiness Resistance：Lv3, Spirit Magic：Lv5, Soil Magic：Lv3, Water Magic：Lv4, Medicinal Herb Knowledge：Lv4, Divine Protection of the Spirits, Magic Manipulation, Child of the Forest 

Equipment: 
Cane of the Black Speckled Elm, Breastplate of the Red Monkey, Clothes of the Forest Spider's Thread, Overcoat of the Forest Spider's Thread, Ring of Water Production</pre>

<p>He’s a Wood Elf: same as the Guild Master. His Skill configuration is also similar. The only difference is that he’s not strong, huh? I think that Clad’s overall strength is higher. In particular, his peculiar pro-magic build seemingly characteristic to the Elves isn’t that eye-opening.</p>

<p>As for his companions, there’re two Warriors and one person with the configuration of a Ranger. It’s pretty well-balanced.</p>

<p>「Then I guess I’m next? I’m Amanda. Best regards.」</p>

<p>Without mentioning her Rank, she gives a brief greeting. However, just that was enough. The only Adventurer that didn’t know of her would have been Fran a couple of days ago, after all.</p>

<p>The Rank E’s are too shocked for words. That an A Rank would take on a Rank D request is unprecedented; she sticks out like a sore thumb.</p>

<p>Only Clad seems capable of forming his words.</p>

<p>「I see how it is…」<br>
「What do you mean?」<br>
「I mean that I know th’ reason an A Rank like <em>you’</em>d take on such a low-rank request! This commission’s probably just somethin’ you took in your spare time, right?! We had to seriously prepare ourselves, y’know?! This isn’t where you should be playing around!」</p>

<p><em>Uwaー</em> He said it right to her face, huh. Well, I can see that he’s only pretending to be tough given by his stiff expression though. Maybe he’s at the age where he’s compelled to pick fights with the strong?</p>

<p>「I have no intention of simply playing around though? Besides, I have permission from the Guild Master.」<br>
「<em>Tsk</em>」<br>
「Now, now. Then, the young lady next please.」</p>

<p>Cruz diverts the conversation to bring a change to the bad air starting to develop. With the selfish Amanda and the seemingly-strong Clad, he has good reason to worry about the situation. This has definitely surpassed the duties of an examiner. My condolences.</p>

<p>「Fran.」<br>
「…… That’s all? Is there anything else?」<br>
「Rank D. Beastman. Favorite thing: <strong>Curry</strong>. Don’t particularly dislike anything.」</p>

<p>Clad, your gaze is scary. He doesn’t really seem to like Fran. She’s a newly-raised Rank D, so it’s possible that he can’t permit such a young girl being ranked higher than himself.</p>

<p>「No, that’s not… I was meaning your weapon choice or the like…」<br>
「<em>Oi, <strong>brat</strong></em>. I said it before, but we’re going at this mission <strong><em>seriously</em></strong>. If y’think this’ll just be a simple excursion, then it’s better for you to go back home and suck your mom’s teat ‘nstead!」</p>

<p><em>Weーll</em>, you certainly like picking fights, huh Clad? Even though you’re a Human, you seem more like a mad dog. Moreover, he’s even using his Threatening Skill. His intention to make her cry is clear, but… Well, things like that don’t work on Fran at all.</p>

<p>「Mother’s dead.」<br>
「…… <em>Tsk</em>.」</p>

<p>Mhm. Those words hit the hardest, huh. If he could retort to even that, his identity as a Human would seriously be doubted. In addition, he would’ve needed to do so under the bloodthirsty gaze that Amanda’s giving off.</p>

<p>「For an adult to shout at a child! Seriously… Are you alright, Fran?」<br>
「Nn. No problem.」</p>

<p>Such a threat was only at the level of a puppy yapping away when compared to the feeling of intimidation given off from a <em>devil</em>. Hopefully, my implied meaning in those words is understood. Anyways, Clad returns with provocation. His aim isn’t Fran, though.</p>

<p>「<strong><em>You–!</em></strong> Wadda ya mean by that? <em>Aah?</em>」<br>
「<em>Errー</em> Then, because the self-introductions are over, I’ll move on to the briefing.」</p>

<p>Wanting to avoid any more turmoil, Cruz forcibly ends the conversation. Hang in there, Cruz. I have no means of helping you, but because the above-mentioned dispute has happened early on, do your best. It’s a good opportunity, probably!</p>

<p>「<em>Please</em>, attempt to be friends for the duration of the request.」<br>
「<em>Fuー</em>」<br>
「<em>Ke</em>」<br>
「No problem. Good friends.」<br>
「I sincerely hope that’s the case…!」</p>

<p>After crying so in desperation, Cruz moved onto the briefing.</p>

<p>「The request consists of the investigation of Aressa’s Dungeon:『Cobweb』which has already been conquered. In addition, we are to recover the Magic Ore that’s being generated by the Dungeon at the same time.」</p>

<p>The Dungeon consists of six layers, and its inhabitants mainly consist of insect-type Demonic Beasts. In particular, the 5th and 6th layers are essentially Spider Demonic Beast nests, and their numbers are no laughing matter.</p>

<p>「Because the Magic Ore is generated in the Dungeon Core Room, it’s necessary to make our way there.」<br>
「So we’re to collect Magic Ore, then.」<br>
「<em>Ah</em>, ’bout the Demonic Beasts, can we take ’em down? They’re bein’ allowed to live there on purpose, right? 」<br>
「<em>Ahh</em>, there’s no problem. Reducing the number of Demonic Beasts is also part of the request to a certain extent.」<br>
「<em>Hehehe.</em> I’m lookin’ forward to it.」</p>

<p>Spider-type Demonic Beasts by the name of Trap Spider reside in Cobweb, ranked at Threat Level F. It isn’t a bad opponent for low-class Adventurers for the sake of experience.</p>

<p>「I’ll warn you now, but while the Spiders are weak when they’re alone, they’re intelligent enough to use traps in groups. Their true threat comes from their cooperation. Please, don’t be careless.」<br>
「<em>Ke</em>, there’s no <em>way</em> I’d lose to a Demonic Beast that even a Rank F could take care a’. They’re nothin’ but experience points.」<br>
「…… In addition, Demonic Beasts aren’t the only thing to watch out for inside the Dungeon. Most of the traps in Cobweb aren’t a big deal, but watch out for Transition Traps.」</p>

<p>Transition Traps are traps that transfer their victim to any place in the Dungeon. It’s difficult to prevent them from triggering, so even experts can fall into a crisis.</p>

<p>There seem to have been cases where Transition Traps placed in spider webs were triggered, sending their victims to Monster Rooms. There’s a need to be careful.</p>

<p>「The Transition Trap is a fiendish trap that can sometimes involve more than just yourself. Be careful.」<br>
「Yeah, yeah. I got it, I got it.」</p>

<p>He doesn’t understand at all. I’m worried. With a reckless, incompetent fellow with a high likelihood of sabotaging others… I’ll have to protect Fran.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 47: A Little Bit of Training</h1>

<p>It’s the first day of the Dungeon Investigation commission.</p>

<p>With the group who left the Guild after making a commotion, we arrived at the entrance to a cave after half of the day had passed.</p>

<p>Well, the journey itself was quite serious in its own way. Mainly due to Clad. It seems he has the king-of-the-mountain trait, not liking anyone taking the lead other than himself; he just charged ahead each and every time. I was surprised that he would even talk back to the examiner: Cruz.</p>

<p>If he really wants to raise to D Rank, he couldn’t seriously think that leaving a bad impression is the way to go, right? Or is he thinking that ‘I have to be assertive!’ = ‘I’m the type to make decisions proactively!’ and ‘I’m not scared of my superiors!’ = ‘I have courage!’…?</p>

<p>I don’t see the appeal.</p>

<p>Well, the thoughts of one person doesn’t amount to much in the end.</p>

<p>Anyways, because Amanda is quite strong-willed, standoffs between the two continued to occur regularly. Because Clad always ended up losing to Amanda’s vigor, he really have stopped oppose her from the start.</p>

<p>Frion stayed uninvolved with any disputes, taking the position of a complete bystander. However, it could also be said that he was unwilling to lend a hand in quelling the arguments, too. Because of this, mediation between the two whenever a dispute occurred was left entirely to Cruz. Is it just my imagination, or does he seem strangely fatigued even though only half a day has passed? Everyone should really pitch in to help with these sorts of things.</p>

<p>What about Fran, you ask? Well, everyone has strong points and weak points.</p>

<p>That all aside, it was interesting to see Amanda battling along the way. Not only was her use of the whip amazing, but her use of wind-type Magic seemed incredibly useful. Unlike fire-type magics, using them in the middle of a woodland is fine.</p>

<p>After everything that occurred, we arrived a bit behind schedule. While we should have arrived at the Dungeon in the evening, it’s already night.</p>

<p>「Erm… Originally we should have gone inside on the first day and traveled through two layers of the Dungeon, capturing the rest tomorrow, but… Because we’re a little behind schedule, we’ll stop and camp here today and head into the Dungeon early tomorrow. Sound good?」<br>
「What d’you mean ‘camp’! We should just hurry up and start conquering the Dungeon immediately, right? Conquering this Dungeon’ll be easy; there’re only small fries inside, y’know?」<br>
「The Ranks of the Demonic Beasts within are indeed low, but it’s dangerous to go in with a tired body. And so, we’ll be camping here today.」<br>
「I agree.」<br>
「Me too.」<br>
「Sounds good.」<br>
「<em>Tsk</em>! Cowards!」</p>

<p>Even after saying so, Clad doesn’t stand up and go in by himself. Even <em>he</em> should understand that it’s dangerous to go into the Dungeon after walking for half a day. Cruz seems a bit unsatisfied with his reaction, but he doesn’t say anything else.</p>

<p>To be honest, Clad’s the type of person I inherently dislike. He’s just the sort of person to start throwing in weird suggestions and quibble when an agenda is about to be finalized in class. <em>Even though</em> the surroundings are thinking「Geez, it doesn’t matter. I just want this to be finished so I can go home, so be quiet already.」he’d continue to oppose the popular opinion endlessly.</p>

<p>「Fran! Would you like to sleep in my Tent? It’d be fine to leave the watch to the men.」<br>
「Decline.」<br>
「<em>Aーhh</em>, so <em>coーld</em>.」<br>
「I’ll leave the first watch to you, miss Fran. After that, my group, Clad’s group, and Frion’s group will take over in that order.」</p>

<p>Oho, he pushed the Midnight watch — the most difficult time — to Clad, huh. You shouldn’t do that, Cruz. Even if it’s only a little, don’t retaliate.</p>

<p>「The A Rank won’t be keeping watch?」<br>
「Amanda is acting as a spectator. Besides, if I asked her to help then it wouldn’t be a proper test for you guys. If she participated, it’d take less than an hour to traverse the Dungeon on foot, and we’d be able to leave for home before the day ends. As for the results of the examination in that case: you’d all fail.」</p>

<p>Even non-standard opponents would be easily finished off by an A Rank. In fact, they’d only be at the level of a nuisance. With that, it’d be better to look at Amanda as insurance in case of an emergency.</p>

<p>「<em>Ke.</em> Is that so.」</p>

<p>It’s already been decided that I’ll keep watch as well when it’s Cruz’s turn. He continued grumbling afterwards, but was made to fall silent by Amanda in the end.</p>

<p>「You should have been notified beforehand, but meals and bedding are to be prepared by each party individually, alright?」</p>

<p>There’s also that. After asking Randell, we obtained some high-quality bedding. A sleeping bag and blankets, all for just 7,000<sub>Gorudo</sub>!</p>

<p>As for the meals… Well, that goes without saying. I had cooked large quantities of Demonic Beasts for this exact purpose, after all. Because we’re the first watch we postponed the meal, however.</p>

<p>「<em>Oi, Oi</em>. Can a single brat e’en keep watch?」<br>
「No problem.」<br>
「<em>Ahh</em>? Y’think I can just trust a brat’s words so easily?」<br>
「She’s a Rank D Adventurer. That’s higher than you guys, right? If she says that there’re no problems, then it’s fine.」<br>
「Her even <em>being</em> Rank D is questionable! What could a kid have done while we were on expedition, hah? Chances are, she just used ‘er body t’gain the favor of that lolicon Guild Master, right? So, how’d ya be able to do it, huh?!」</p>

<p><em>Ahー</em>, this guy was part of the returned-from-the-investigation group, huh. In that case, he wouldn’t have a chance to witness Fran’s battle prowess. At a Rank of this level, tricks shouldn’t be possible to measure the ability of an individual, yet Clad misunderstood that as us getting our Rank through unjust means.</p>

<p>Well. Our increase in Ranks was quite peculiar. There’s plenty of room for doubt.</p>

<p>Still, I can’t forgive what I can’t forgive.</p>

<p>『Fran, how are you holding up?』<br>
（? Nothing particularly wrong. Slightly noisy.）</p>

<p>Clad continues exercising his Threatening Skill, but it seems that it’s only seen as a bit noisy to Fran.</p>

<p>「Ability.」<br>
「<strong><em>Ha</em><em>!</em></strong> <em>Ability</em>? A brat like you can’t reach Rank D with jus’ ability!」<br>
「Ability (mine and Teacher’s).」<br>
「<em>Hyahaha</em>! A’right, then <em>show me</em>. Let’s ‘train’ a little.」</p>

<p>After saying so, Clad lifts up his Spear. It seems he’s intent on having a mock battle.</p>

<p>Fran raises slowly in return. <em>Haaー</em> Her battle-preparations are already complete.</p>

        </div>
        

<p>『Fran, sparring is fine but don’t go too far, alright?』<br>
（Understood. Just training a bit.）</p>

<p>She has a good smile. However, no one else is saying anything. Because Frion and his companions aren’t the type to speak up I can understand it, but……</p>

<p>I’d have thought that Amanda would have put a stop to this at the very beginning… Instead, she’s just laughing. Well, maybe she figures there’s no problem due to the difference in ability between Fran and Clad.</p>

<p>As for Cruz though, he doesn’t seem to plan on stepping in at all. Has he become so exhausted that he’s completely ran out of fuel? No, it doesn’t seem like that’s the case. He’s looking at the two with an earnest expression.</p>

<p>That reminds me, I didn’t see Cruz in the Goblin Subjugation either. Chances are, he was part of the return group in that case. In other words… He also wants to ascertain Fran’s abilities. Cruz’s two companions are casually paying attention to the surroundings, as to act as substitutions for Fran.</p>

<p>『Fran, before we begin, you should set up a Barrier in the surroundings.』</p>

<p>If we start the mock battle as-is, Clad might end up complaining that we didn’t do a proper job as lookout.</p>

<p>（Nn. Understood.）</p>

<p>「――Wind・Zone」<br>
「――Ground・Zone」</p>

<p>Wind・Zone is a magic barrier from Wind Magic, and can cover any range from its origin in a dome-shape. If anything intrudes within the barrier, the caster can sense it using the flow of wind.</p>

<p>Ground・Zone is also a magic barrier, this time from Soil Magic. It also creates a dome of any range from the origin. The difference between it and Wind・Zone is that it acts on and under the ground. On the other hand, it has no effect on intrusions via the air.</p>

<p>Through employing both Wind and Soil, one is able to cover all directions.</p>

<p>「……<em>Ha</em>? T-This is… Magic?」<br>
「Moreover, from two attributes…」<br>
「Seriously?」</p>

<p>Clad’s party members started making noise in the background. Up until now, they had been watching things develop with smirks on their faces… But now they’ve taken on a blue tint.</p>

<p>「Y-You… You’re a Magician?!」<br>
「? Not a Magician.」<br>
「No, but, that jus’ now was Magic, wasn’t it?!」<br>
「Usable without being a Magician.」<br>
「T-That’s true, but……」</p>

<p>It seems that with only barrier-type magic we’ve managed to intimidate Clad. It’s only a simple Lv4 magic, so only Rank E Adventurers and their equivalents will show up for Fran.</p>

<p>「Then, let’s begin.」<br>
「R-Right. A’right, let’s go!」</p>

<p>‘I can’t use magic, but my Spear won’t lose’. Such is the feeling I get from the determined expression on his face. In a fight between a Sword and a Spear, the Spear has an overwhelming advantage. In a one-on-one match, it can’t be beat.</p>

<p>「…… Any time.」<br>
「<em>Tsuyaah!</em>」</p>

<p>No wait-and-see tactics? Is that alright? Perhaps he’s going full-offensive since he sensed Fran’s strength a bit?</p>

<p>With all his energy placed in a lunge to her face, Clad has no plans on stopping just before the strike lands. Frion, who was watching in an easygoing manner while dining shows an expression of shock. This is, indeed, surprising. From behind, Clad’s comrades leak a scream. Seeing Fran not move at all, they must have thought that Clad’s strike landed directly.</p>

<p>However, their expectations were way off the mark.</p>

<p>「No use.」</p>

<p>Fran, with only light swing of me, deflects the tip of the spear. Clad, whose body was covered in too much momentum, becomes wide open. There, Fran’s kick explodes.</p>

<p>「<em><strong>GAH!</strong></em>」</p>

<p>Blown off his feet, Clad falls to the ground.</p>

<p>「Damn it!」<br>
「Continue?」<br>
「O-Obviously! My guard was down jus’ then, but I won’t be ‘olding back from now on!」</p>

<p><em>Ohh!</em> This is the first time I’ve heard the bad-loser cliché! He’s unsightly for saying such a thing, so I can’t really say that I approve. Well, maybe I can a little.</p>

<p>「Then, my move.」<br>
「<em>Aa<strong>ーgh!</strong></em>」</p>

<p>From Clad’s perspective, Fran’s figure should have disappeared, followed by a sudden impact from the side. Through Fran’s quick movements, he was struck with my stomach.</p>

<p>「I can still……!」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「Ora<em>ora<strong>oraah</strong></em><strong><em>!</em></strong>」</p>

<p>In desperation, Clad swings his spear around violently, giving off consecutive thrusts. Fran isn’t hit at all, however. <em>Thrust, thrust, thrust</em>. <em>Dodge, dodge, dodge</em>. I wonder how long this process repeated itself?</p>

<p>「Why?! What’s–!」<br>
「Not hitting.」<br>
「How is this even–!」</p>

<p>It’s probably been around three minutes since Clad continued striking with his Spear. I already feel dizzy, you know? Panting, his expression has turned miserable, probably due to the shock of realizing that not even one of his attacks have been successful.</p>

<p>「Damn it, <em>damn it!</em>」<br>
「Then, time to finish.」<br>
「<strong><em>Damn iiii</em></strong>――<em><strong>GOHA</strong></em>！」</p>

<p>For the second time, I strike him. This time, the strike lands on his face, causing him to lose consciousness and fall onto his back.</p>

<p>「<strong>Leader!</strong>」</p>

<p>Clad’s companions quickly rush to his side.</p>

<p>『Well, with this he shouldn’t make such a fuss anymore.』<br>
「Nn. Regrettable.」<br>
『Ahh, regrettable indeed.』</p>

<p>He didn’t make a good sparring partner by any means. Still, against a person with such a difficult personality, the battle was comical at least.</p>

<p>「Fran, so stroーng〜」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>Suddenly, Amanda’s arms wrap around Fran. I wasn’t even able to notice her approach. <em>Damn</em>, how mortifying.</p>

<p>However, Amanda has a hint of discomfort on her face. She has the same gentle smile as usual, but… Her eyes aren’t smiling at all. If anything, they look the same as a bird of prey which found game.</p>

<p>「Hey. Won’t you spar with me as well?」<br>
「With Amanda?」<br>
「That’s right. I’m a Solo A Rank, you know? I’ve been having trouble finding a training partner lately, but if it’s Fran then some good practice might be possible!」</p>

<p><em>Ahh</em>, she wouldn’t have anyone to train with, would she? Sparring with an A Rank… It would be a valuable experience. Training in of itself is good. I don’t think that any accidents will occur, either……</p>

<p> 『Hey, Fran――』<br>
（Great training for Master Sword Arts.）<br>
『… That’s right.』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p><em>Hah</em>… it’s no good. She’s in complete battle-mode right now. It won’t be possible to stop Fran when she’s like this.</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 48: A Short Spar</h1>

<p>「<em>Haahhh!</em>」<br>
「<em>Fuu!</em>」<br>
『Dangerous! This is seriously dangerous!』</p>

<p>Amanda’s whip strikes where Fran had just been standing.</p>

<p><em>*Do<strong>GOoOoO</strong>*</em></p>

<p>That isn’t the power of a whip! It’s more like some sort of giant mallet was thrown into the fray, sinking the ground in!</p>

<p>「<em>Ahahaha!</em> That’s the way, Fran!」<br>
「……!」</p>

<p>We’re caught completely in Amanda’s pace. Fran’s been obstructed by that transcendent-quality whip right from the start, so it’s impossible to get in close.</p>

<p>As expected of an A Rank Adventurer. I had thought that we could have a good match, but I was making light of her.</p>

<p>『That whip sure is troublesome…』</p>

<p>Only defensive movement can be taken to block its attacks, which come from any angle. The strikes are ever-changing, and infinite in variety. Sometimes, the attacks can come in the form of heavy-hitting blunt strikes, sometimes they can cut clean through rocks, and sometimes, not even sound can keep up with them. Frankly speaking, it’s strange that Fran hasn’t been defeated already.</p>

<p>『Are you alright?』<br>
（Teacher, interference: forbidden.）<br>
『I know.』<br>
（<em>Nn!</em> Will absolutely get an attack in.）<br>
『<em>Ou</em>. Do your best.』</p>

<p>That might be too high a target… Amanda hasn’t even moved from her starting position, after all.</p>

<p>She’s already peerless when it comes to the whip, but it should be kept in mind that Amanda’s Job is Champion of Storms, meaning she’s fully capable of using the higher form of Wind Magic: Storm Magic. However, she has yet to use any magic whatsoever. In other words, she hasn’t considered it necessary to do so.</p>

<p>Even if I observe her flow of magic using the Sorcery Skill, there’s no change. And, on top of not using any magic, she hasn’t even used any Whip Techniques, giving a looming feeling of dread.</p>

<p>However, Fran isn’t ordinary either. Gradually, she’s getting used to the movements of the whip. The distance between her and Amanda is growing shorter.</p>

<p>「<em>Now</em>!」<br>
「Naïve!」<br>
「Predicted.」<br>
「<em>Mu–!</em> You did it, huh!」</p>

<p>Maybe the mock battle was worth it, after all? Fran reached a position where I could almost reach Amanda.</p>

<p>Finally, after five minutes since the battle began, Amanda was forced to move her legs. Fran, receiving an immense amount of bloodthirst, takes some distance once again.</p>

<p>「Ah, pardon me. It seems that the naïve one was me.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「…… <em>Sh!</em>」<br>
「<em>–Bu</em>」<br>
「It’s the first time in a while that I needed to dodge in a fight.」</p>

<p>With her whip undulating like a snake, Amanda launches herself at Fran. Her movement is just like a snake. Furthermore, the presence of magic was felt from whatever Skill she was using. Most likely, it’s a Whip Technique.</p>

<p>With that, the battle intensifies even further. Wounds, big and small, cover Fran’s entire body the more time passes. The power of the whip clad in magic power using Whip Techniques is terrific, and while Fran is barely able to evade them, she’s being damaged by the wind pressure.</p>

<p>Still, I’m not too worried. The day we met Amanda, we went to look up information on her. Right off the bat, we found that she was a good person in general, and was good-natured through and through.</p>

<p>To begin with, Amanda has managed an orphanage for more that 30 years. There’re nearly 500 people in the current Aressa who came from said orphanage, making her well-loved by many.</p>

<p>When Cobweb was still active near Aressa in the past, Adventurers flourished. Because of that, the number of orphans whose Parents died while adventuring also rose, and the guards weren’t exactly the kindest, either. At 20 years old, Amanda (only a D Rank at the time) extended a helping hand out to such children.</p>

<p>Casting her materials aside, she build an orphanage to educate and bring up any orphans she could find. Nowadays there’s plenty of help from people around town, and the management of the orphanage is favorable as well, but… Back then it would have been painful to smile through it all.</p>

<p>Furthermore, regarding the Title ‘Guardian of Children’, to obtain it you not only have to <em>save</em> children, but be <em>loved</em> by them as well. It’s said to be a Title that would be lost upon enacting any inappropriate behavior.</p>

<p>Amanda, possessing such a Title, would obviously be a good friend for Fran, who is a child herself.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>Perhaps, so long as they’re both mutually satisfied, then it’s of no consequence whether injuries are inflicted in this battle… Or maybe, it’s because all of these wounds aren’t inflicted with malicious intent.</p>

<p>「<em><strong>Ha!</strong></em>」<br>
「<em>Kuu……</em>」</p>

<p>Still, the intensity of this battle is worrisome.</p>

<p>It’s gradually becoming a one-sided battle, with Fran on the defensive.</p>

<p>… Huh? At this rate, isn’t this really bad? Anti-Death prevents instant death, but it isn’t absolute. You could die again immediately if you’re in a Poisoned or Bleeding State.</p>

<p>Should I stop them?</p>

<p>— No, let’s wait and see for a while longer. Fran is intent on landing at least one blow in this battle.</p>

<p>「<em><strong>Now!</strong></em>」</p>

<p>Fran moved. To Amanda which activated another Whip Technique, she stepped forward by force. At onlooker might see it as desperation, but I know that’s not the case.</p>

<p>「<em>Gu…!</em>」</p>

<p>The whip, thrust forward, scrapes out Fran’s side. Blood dances in the air as it escapes the open wound, but Fran, who pushes her back by force with Wind Magic, advances with a grimace.</p>

<p>「As expected of you!」<br>
「<em>Ha……!</em>」</p>

<p>Using half of her remaining magic, Fran lunges with her whole body. It isn’t a Sword Technique, but its offensive power is probably equivalent to one.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there was no time for Amanda to pull back her whip for the sake of a counterattack.</p>

<p>「Wind・Shield!」</p>

<p><em><strong>GYyYyan!</strong>*</em></p>

<p>With a high-pitched sound, the blow which had Fran’s whole body invested in it was… Prevented. Wind Magic, which Amanda hadn’t used up until this point, had nullified it. It goes without saying that it was only used because Amanda had been driven into a corner. However, Fran’s aim was to land a single blow. She won’t be satisfied with just this.</p>

<p>And so, Fran released the magic she had reserved: Flare・Blast.</p>

<p>It was launched immediately after defensive magic was used. Even Amanda wouldn’t be able to reactivate a proper defensive measure in time.</p>

<p>『Splendid!』</p>

<p>Throughout the entire battle, I had been chanting Arias with Parallel Thought to see what times I could potentially land a blow, and in my opinion, that was the best timing thus far.</p>

<p>「<em>Kuu!</em>」</p>

<p><em><strong>*GaGOOOOON*</strong></em></p>

<p>With Amanda hit directly by Flare・Blast, a great explosion ensued. A cloud of dust, kicked up as though a bomb had detonated, covers the entire area. The ground around us melts, becoming something akin to lava. Just how hot is it, I wonder?</p>

<p>She isn’t dead, right? She’s an A Rank, but the explosion just now was a bit dangerous…… There was a time when I thought so.</p>

<p>What manner of magic would it take for her to remain unscathed? Not only that, to be in perfect condition! No matter how you look at it, this woman’s too far out of the norm! I know that there’s Fire Resistance and all, but to that extent?!</p>

<p>「That was dangerous……」<br>
「Nn…… Regret…ful…」</p>

<p><em>*dosa*</em></p>

<p>With that, Fran collapses with a look of vexation. With such excessive bleeding, there’s no question that she had become light-headed. And so, reaching the limit of her endurance, Fran went unconscious on the spot.</p>

<p>『How regretful…… Still, you’ve done well.』</p>

<p>It was good to have fought against this monster of an opponent here. Furthermore, she did it without my assistance.</p>

<p>「Fran! I’m so sorry!」</p>

<p>Amanda approaches the collapsed Fran in a hurry, and takes out a Potion before sprinkling it on Fran. Without a doubt, it’s a first-class Life Potion.</p>

<p>「As a reward for your perseverance you should have landed that strike, but… Grace of the Spirits protected me automatically.」</p>

<p>I see, so it was thanks to Grace of the Spirits. It seems to be a Skill which automatically invalidates damage to a certain degree. It’s an extremely strong Skill, but it has the drawback of needing 24 hours to reuse.</p>

<p>Fran might be unconvinced, but I think that her strike was definitely a good one, one that invoked the absolute defense of her opponent.</p>

<p>Well, for now, rest well. As for the watch…… The others can take care of it. Probably.</p>

                    <br>

        <h1>Chapter 49: Lessons from Ms. Amanda　〜The So-Called Explanation-Time〜</h1>

<p>It’s been one hour since Fran’s sparring match and defeat with Amanda.</p>

<p>After waking up, Fran took a seat face-to-face with Amanda. As Amanda was feeling apologetic for letting the battle escalate so far, it was decided that she would teach us some of the information we wanted to know.</p>

<p>As Fran was able to learn a lot through the battle, I don’t really think that there was a need take over Fran’s watch and personally guard her while she slept as well as grant us this, but… Since it’s already like this, we’ve might as well accept it, right?</p>

<p>「Then, first I’ll explain fighting Skills.」<br>
「Please.」<br>
「However, I’m not too strong when it comes to theories, so I won’t be able to explain everything. Is that alright?」<br>
「That’s fine.」</p>

<p>To us who know near-nothing, any information is precious.</p>

<p>「Then, Combat Arts are things like Sword Arts, which allow one to improve their handling with a respective weapon; these improvements can also be seen with Techniques. Combat Techniques like Sword Techniques, Pugilist Techniques, and my preferred Whip Techniques all hold special moves that consume one’s magical power. Did you know of that?」<br>
「Nn. I know.」</p>

<p>Sword Arts is required to learn Sword Techniques, and Bow Arts is required to learn Bow Techniques. Furthermore, it’s impossible to learn Combat Techniques at a higher level than their respective Combat Arts, making the two a pair. In other words, one must bear in mind that if their Sword Arts is only Lv5, they can only level Sword Techniques up to Lv5.</p>

<p>「After that is only a matter of learning how to use Combat Techniques themselves, but……」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「Well, I’m not really clear on the details surrounding that.」<br>
「Eh?」<br>
「No, well, the methods to learn can be grasped through training, but… I don’t really know the <em>detailed theory</em> around it. If you ask someone researching the subject, you might be able to understand it a bit better.」<br>
「Just training method is fine.」<br>
「That’s usually how it is for Adventurers. Anyways, I suppose for that I should talk about the prerequisites of Vigor Manipulation and Magic Manipulation? As for the reason for needing them…… To be frank, I don’t know why either. As a Half-Elf, I gained both of them before I could remember. Well, it seems that Fran didn’t have any problems with them either, so shall I simply omit it?」<br>
「Nn. Don’t mind.」<br>
「Then, moving onto the training method for Combat Techniques, just envision yourself pouring your magic into the weapon as well as your body. Then, like a flash, Combat Techniques arrive. The Techniques themselves are activated when you don’t go against that flash. After the first use, the Technique is acquired in the form of a Skill of sorts, so there’s no problem using it from that point on. Fran can use Combat Techniques too, so do you remember acquiring them?」<br>
「?」<br>
「Well, Fran is still small, so you probably learned your Combat Techniques when you were even younger, right? It’s possible that you’ve forgotten. Still, to be able to use Combat Techniques at such a young age, you’re pretty prodigious, huh.」</p>

<p>Dangerous. We were saved by the fact that Fran’s a child. Anyways, in regards to the method of obtaining Combat Techniques, I have a rough idea of how it works. With this, not only Sword Arts, but Sword Techniques should also be able to be trained manually.</p>

<p>「Once a Combat Technique has been learned, you should continuously use it to raise the Skill’s level. The reason being each time a level goes up in a form of Combat Techniques, a new Technique is learned.」</p>

<p>Lv1 must be the most difficult to raise, then.</p>

<p>「Next, shall I move onto the description of Magic?」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「In Magic, the basic attributes are Soil, Water, Fire, and Wind. Their superior versions are Ground, Ocean, Flame, and Storm respectively.」</p>

<p>All four of the basic attributes can be used already.</p>

<p>「After those are what are called ‘composite attributes’. Those are Lightning, Ice, Nature, Lava, Sandstorm, and Life: those 6.」<br>
「Composite?」<br>
「Yes. You can acquire those attributes after improving two of the basic attributes. For example, Nature Magic requires Water and Soil Magic.」<br>
「Possible to learn? Or not?」<br>
「Well, I’ll get to that.」</p>

<p>To learn Magic, one can either become a pupil of an experienced magician, or learn it through means of memorization, or… Well, there’re various methods.</p>

<p>Amanda seemed to have learned how to use magic through memorization and training. However, the training method is quite terrific. What makes it terrific is the fact that the method itself closely resembles the practices of a certain Hunter×Hunter.</p>

<p>For Water Magic, one has to touch water every day, drink it, soak in it, and hammer the essence of water into one’s mind and body. When water flows even in one’s dreams, then it becomes possible to learn Water Magic.</p>

<p>If it’s Wind Magic, then running about naked in strong gales would work. For Soil, you’d just need to be buried under the ground, or take bites out of stones. Well, such training might be a bit excessive, so only <em>some</em> magicians do such things… Was it my imagination that Amanda’s eyes swam for a moment? She would have trained for the Wind, so……</p>

<p>Anyways, unlike Sword Arts, there seems to be no guarantee that magic can be learned, the reason being ‘The Wall of Talent’. For Sword Arts, even if there’s a difference in the effort needed between individuals, anyone can learn and improve through proper dedication. In Magic, however, if you don’t have talent, you can’t acquire it. Period.</p>

<p>「Talent?」<br>
「Yeah. It might be better to say that each person has a certain compatibility with each attribute. For a person incompatible with the Fire Attribute, no matter how much effort they put into learning Fire Magic, they won’t be able to do so.」</p>

<p>So, without talent, no matter how much training one does, it would all be to waste? Even with the dedication to burn oneself, it’d be possible to achieve no results… How terrible.</p>

<p>「Currently there isn’t a method of examining which attributes one has a talent for, however, I don’t think a person with absolutely <em>no</em> talent exists, so it’d be possible to learn Magic so long as one keeps at it.」<br>
「Depends on efforts.」<br>
「That’s how it is. Incidentally, I had attempted to train myself for Fire, but I wasn’t able to learn it in the end. Instead, it seemed that I had talent for Wind, so I was able to learn it in about a week.」<br>
「I see.」<br>
「It seems that there’re also cases of geniuses capable of using Magic ever since they were born too, I think? I wonder if Fran’s one such case?」<br>
「Nn?」<br>
「You can’t remember, huh. Well, that’s fine. Returning to the subject of composite attributes, there’re two main issues in acquiring them.」<br>
「Have to learn two attributes first.」<br>
「Right. After that, there’s the question of whether you have talent for the<em>composite attribute</em> itself.」</p>

<p>Because of those two things, composite attributes are extremely rare. Until now, the only composite attribute we’ve seen has been Nature Magic from both the Guild Master and Frion… Both of which are Wood Elves. Because of that, I’m under the impression that aptitude towards Nature Magic simply came to them due to their Race. If that’s the case, then it’s simply to be expected that composite attributes aren’t seen often.</p>
        

<p>「And so, composite attributes are very rare.」</p>

<p>As for Fran, I wonder where her talent lies? Magic shared by me is usable without a problem for the four basic attributes; Dark and Recovery Magic are also the same. In that case, perhaps Skills gained through a shared relationship disregard talent. No matter how you look at it, it’d be highly irregular for her to have talent in all 4 attributes, after all…</p>

<p>「Next, I’ll explain the rest of the attributes.」<br>
「Dark and Recovery?」<br>
「Just like those. First, let’s start with Light and Dark.」</p>

<p>The Light and Dark attributes aren’t included among the four basic ones. While the methods to attain them doesn’t differ with the basic four, they’re exempted simply due to the overwhelmingly few amount of people with talent for them.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, they’re even rarer than those with talent with Composite Magic, making the order of rarity 4 Basic → Composite → Light and Dark. Being able to acquire Dark Magic from the Demon was extremely lucky.</p>

<p>「With the inclusion of Light and Dark, there’re even more attributes to be derived. The derivations of Light are Purification and Illusion while Dark can be derived into Poison and Ghost.」</p>

<p>Everyone with talent for the Light attribute will also have talent with Purification and Illusion without exception. Similarly, talent in the Poison and Ghost attributes is also guaranteed if one has talent with Dark, so the derivation attributes are actually seen as subordinate-attributes in the eyes of researchers. Also, having talent with the derived attributes doesn’t necessarily mean that an individual will have talent in the Dark or Light attributes themselves.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Poison and Purification have higher attributes: Decay and Cleansing. There’re way too many magic attributes.</p>

<p>「Other than those, there’re also unique attributes.」</p>

<p>The unique attributes include Recovery, Support, Summoning, Contract, Space-Time, Moonlight, Spirit, Smithing, and other non-generic ones. Practitioners of Support and Recovery Magic seem to be plentiful, but when it comes to attributes like Space-Time and Moonlight, their rarity surpasses even Light and Dark.</p>

<p>「Those’re only the ones off the top of my head, but there’re many other unique attributes scattered across the world. There seem to be attributes unique to Demonic Beasts, too.」<br>
「Such as?」<br>
「Well, rumors have it that Dragons possess magic only usable by themselves. There’s a similar case said about Fiends and such. Compared with mankind, Demonic Beasts that can use magic outnumber us by a wide margin, after all.」<br>
「Why?」<br>
「Well, in the first place, Demonic Beasts make use of magic on a daily basis. Demonic Beasts larger than castles would be killed off in no time if they didn’t reinforce their bodies with magic, right? To them, magic is second nature — like breathing. Because of that, Demonic Beasts can use Magic even without Magic Manipulation, unlike mankind. Their Magic Stones might also have a hand in that, too… But of course, there’re also ones that have Magic Manipulation as well, further increasing their efficiency.」<br>
「I see.」<br>
「It’s the same with Combat Techniques. Even with differences between Vigor Manipulation and Magic Manipulation, in the end, aren’t they simply Skills making use of magic? Because of that, Demonic Beasts can make use of Combat Techniques without Vigor Manipulation.」</p>

<p>I suppose Skills like Vibration Fang would fall under that category?</p>

<p>「And, due to the Demonic Beasts’ peculiar magic-oriented nature, there’re many individuals capable of using Light and Dark attributes too. Looking at it like that, they’re far more talented than mankind.」</p>

<p>That reminds me, there’s still one thing that I’ve been wondering about.</p>

<p>「Is Dark Magic only used by bad people?」</p>

<p>The Demon made use of it, and Poison and Ghost Magic are the types used by villains no matter how you look at it. If it was me, I wouldn’t be able to trust a practitioner of Ghost Magic on our first meeting no matter what. They’d be an evil person, after all. Or… I’d imagine them to be so, anyways.</p>

<p>「That’s not the case. Demonic Beasts may make use of it, and civilians might think that it’s inherently bad, but… For Adventurers, magic of all kinds is generally recognized as ‘useful’. For example, Ghost Magic is really useful in Dungeon exploration, you know?」</p>

<p>Alright. In that case we can make use of Darkness Magic without a problem. With that, Darkness Reinforcement and other such Skills won’t simply be left to collect dust.</p>

<p>Finally, we asked about the combinations of complex attributes.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Water + Soil = Nature</li>
	<li>Water + Wind = Ice</li>
	<li>Water + Fire = Life</li>
	<li>Wind + Fire = Lightning</li>
	<li>Wind + Soil = Sandstorm</li>
	<li>Soil + Fire = Lava.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are the combinations.</p>

<p>As for the composite attributes between Light and Dark as well as unique attributes, they have yet to be confirmed.</p>

<p>「Well, I don’t know of them, at least.」<br>
「I want a composite attribute.」<br>
「Fran made use of Soil and Wind magic a while back, and you’re good with Fire too, right? With those, it’s possible to aim for Lightning, Sandstorm, and Lava.」<br>
「Nn. I’ll do my best.」</p>

<p>Alright, if that’s what Fran wants then we’ll obtain one without fail!</p>

<p>I could learn a composite attribute through absorbing one, or through manual acquisition. I was able to learn Flame Magic through Fire Magic Lv10, so the possibility of a composite attribute being learned through raising the levels of other magics is high.</p>

<p>『As it stands…… The attribute second to Fire is Wind.』</p>

<p>In the Goblin Den, Wind Magic Lv3 was repeatedly obtained through absorbing the stones of Army Beetles. The efficiency of absorbing higher-leveled Skills is better than lower-leveled ones, after all.</p>

<p>Raising Wind Magic through the insects’ Lv3 versions took far less time than advancing Sword Arts through the Goblins’ Lv1 versions.</p>

<p>『What shall we do…… Perhaps we should give it a level or two?』</p>

<p>47 Self-Evolution Points remain. We should leave 28 of those for the sake of testing out the Superior version of Sword Arts.</p>

<p>『What do you think?』<br>
（What to do?）</p>

<p>In the end, we used 6 Points to raise Wind Magic’s level. As we attained the Lightning Attribute properly, I have no regrets. Furthermore, the Storm Attribute and Master of Wind Titles were also obtained.</p>

<p>（Want to use it quickly.）<br>
『Not here. We only just heard about Composite Attributes from Amanda, so somehow using one immediately would be bad.』<br>
（Alright……）<br>
『When we return to Aressa, let’s test it out. Alright?』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 50: Traps and Tricks</h1>

<p>It’s the second day of the Dungeon Investigation.</p>

<p>「Alright, we’ve broken through 5 layers.」</p>

<p>Our group has already finished exploring four layers.</p>

<p>As for any problems: there haven’t been many. Clad, most likely due to the effect of yesterday’s defeat, has remained quiet. No, perhaps his silence is due to the shock of witnessing the spar between Fran and Amanda when he woke up? Well… It serves him right either way.</p>

<p>Still, Amanda’s approach for ‘training’ was quite terrifying… The spar was fierce, and I could only witness Fran being beaten half to death too. When her side was practically gauged out my guts went cold… Not that I have any guts, of course!</p>

<p>There’re many metaphorical expressions that use parts of the body, so it’s quite difficult to use them for me who is inorganic. Still, that doesn’t matter. The point is, I was a tad worried.</p>

<p>It was good that we were able to see the strength of an A Rank Adventurer firsthand, so while Fran was a bit vexed with the result, she doesn’t seem to have started disliking Amanda. Rather than seeing her as an opponent who she narrowly escaped death from, it’s more likely that Fran is viewing her as another wall to someday climb over. Testament to that is the sense of goodwill I can feel from her towards Amanda.</p>

<p>As for Amanda herself, it seemed that the spar from last night was satisfactory. She had lamented the fact that she could easily defeat common Adventurers simply by wielding a Whip, but with Fran’s high prowess in evasive maneuvers and attack even she would be in danger if she relaxed.</p>

<p>It was because of this that the morning was noisy with her request to spar again… Even to Cruz and Frion, the spar between Amanda and Fran was like something from a different dimension.</p>

<p>They didn’t particularly change their attitude towards Fran, but pieces of their actions and language indicated a slight feeling of awe towards Fran. With that, it seems that they’ve fully recognized her strength.</p>

<p>Surprisingly enough, something akin to kindness was even felt from Cruz. Perhaps he’s finally realized that the one he lost to was Rank D? Or perhaps he’s the type of person who would only accept another after measuring their strength firsthand. How manly, Cruz. However, Fran is off-limits!</p>

<p>Moving on, layers 1 to 4 didn’t have any strong opponents and the traps were few, so we simply proceeded without pause for the most part. The Demonic Beasts themselves were Insect-type, so while it’s a shame, I couldn’t obtain any new Skills from them.</p>

<p>「Now, just a reminder, Trap Spiders will be appearing from now on.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「If we’re surrounded it’ll get troublesome, so be careful.」</p>

<p>Becoming bound by thread is more than enough to lead to defeat — even if your opponent is weak.</p>

<p>「At the same time, the number of traps will increase. The Transition Traps are particularly dangerous, so prepare accordingly. Rather than focusing on the detection of enemies, I’d like to ask everyone with the Thief Job to focus on finding traps.」</p>

<p>And so, with Thieves as the lead, we plunge into the fifth layer. In case of combat, Warriors step forward, with the Magicians providing support from behind.</p>

<p>The materials capable of being gathered from the Spiders, being quite strong for their rank, have moderate value. Their utility is also a part of that. However, they’re weak to fire and burn up easily, so we’ll be refraining from fire-type Magic as much as possible. Instead, Fran wields me.</p>

<p>Like this, traversing the 5th Layer can be done without a problem. Well, that’s only to be expected with this much fighting power on our side.</p>

<p>However… We immediately encountered a problem after delving into the 6th Layer.</p>

<p>「Shit, e’en though they’re jus’ small fries!」<br>
「They aren’t falling, even with Spirit Magic…? This can’t be!」</p>

<p>The Trap Spiders have suddenly become stronger. Not only their size, their increase in vitality is also plainly visible. Perhaps the deeper we delve, the stronger they will become?</p>

<p>After using Appraisal, I can only be surprised by their Name and Description.</p>

<p>『Fran, these aren’t Trap Spiders, they’re Trick Spiders, their evolution!』</p>

<p>At a glance, a Trick Spider only seems to be a large Trap Spider, but their contents are entirely different. They’re the products of Highbreeds that have evolved, after all. The Threat Level of a single Trick Spider is E.</p>

<p>As for their Status, their offensive power is more than double what we’ve been facing thus far. Furthermore, they make use of Confusion Poison, and even have the Deadly Poison Fang Skill. It seems that the number of Adventurers who mistook them for Trap Spiders and attacked them only to lose their lives in the process aren’t few.</p>

<p>「Gennell! What’s wrong?!」<br>
「I… I don’t know… I’ve tried using an Anti-Venom, but it’s not working…」</p>

<p>So someone got hit, huh… The Poison from Trap Spiders is very weak, so even if one swallowed a 5th Grade Anti-Venom it wouldn’t be a problem. And so, mistaking the Trick Spiders for Trap Spiders, they must have continued fighting while swallowing low-class Anti-Venoms, thus falling prey to the deadly poison.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>『Fran. These guys are dangerous.』<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>When Fran takes even the smallest scratch, I immediately apply Antidote — a technique that can even nullify Sovereign Poison completely.</p>

<p>「I-I’m saved!」<br>
「Thank you very much.」<br>
「Nn. Trick Spiders. Strong Poison.」<br>
「Wha-! Trick Spiders?! Impossible! Did evolution occur?!」</p>

<p>In truth, Trick Spiders aren’t supposed to be created in this cave. The strongest of this Dungeon’s Demonic Beasts were supposed to be Trap Spiders.</p>

<p>However, if several factors overlapped then evolution, an occurrence surpassing one’s expectations, can happen.</p>

<p>Those factors start with the birth of an individual too strong for its species. Although it is brought forth by the power of the Dungeon, there are individual differences between each Dungeon Monster. Demonic Beasts with more power than other individuals — sometimes labeled as Unique or Rare individuals — are more than capable of appearing.</p>

<p>And when a powerful individual is born, what do you think happens? It takes a monopoly of the food, forcing the weaker individuals to either cannibalism or starvation. There is the possibility of the strong individual to evolve after eating enough food… But there is also the possibility for a weaker specimen evolving through its survival and cannibalism.</p>

<p>There have been cases where both sides evolve only to eradicate one another, but there have also been cases where the evolved individuals live symbiotically, changing the entire Dungeon ecosystem.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there’re cases where the accidental ingestion of experience-rich food, or external factors leading to evolution.</p>

<p>Well, in the case of a captured Dungeon, the latter two cases are pretty improbable.</p>

<p>「Damn, we were careless! Ms. Amanda!」<br>
「I understand. Fran, will you be coming as well?」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>That marked the beginning of a one-sided slaughter. In an instant, we began reducing the number of Trick Spiders that the Rank E Adventurers were having trouble with. In only minutes, the cluster of ~20 spiders transformed into nothing more than a pile of silent corpses.</p>

<p>「Fighting against small fries really is boring. Right, Fran?」<br>
「<em>Nh-nn</em>. Fun.」<br>
「Oh, is that so? Well, so long as Fran had fun it’s fine.」</p>

<p>While Fran has an enjoyable expression, the rest of the Adventurers have looks of fatigue. Even Clad seems to be nearing his limit.</p>

<p>「Let’s pull back to the 5th Layer! Those guys shouldn’t follow us there!」</p>

<p>Unless they’ve overpopulated or received instructions from a Dungeon Master, Dungeon Monsters are restricted to their own Layer. And so, the Trick Spiders shouldn’t be able to give chase after we reach the 5th Layer.</p>

<p>「If they’re already breeding, this is pretty dangerous.」<br>
「We know already!」<br>
「Fran, act as the rearguard.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「E Rank Parties, withdraw!」<br>
「G-Got i– <em><strong>Gyaa</strong></em>!」<br>
「C-Calm down! ‘S just a scratch!」<br>
「There’re more ‘hind us!」<br>
「’S only <em>one</em>! Jus’ don’t make any noise!」<br>
「H-Here they come again!」</p>

<p>Falling into a panic were some of Clad’s party members from Roar of the Dragon. Not only do they not seem to be accustomed to being surrounded by Demonic Beasts, they’ve taken on the Status Abnormality: Confusion.</p>

<p>「Just wait a sec!」<br>
「S-Shut it!」</p>

<p>Clad is just barely retaining his fighting spirit as two of his subordinates, ones who took a surprise attack from the rear, blindly ran towards the swarm of spiders ahead.</p>

<p>「Ah, wait! There’re might be traps over there!」</p>

<p>And so, sure enough, by running into the area that the Thieves hadn’t scanned yet they triggered traps.</p>

<p><em><strong>*KYUIIIIIIN*</strong></em></p>

<p>「That… Was that a Transition Trap?」<br>
「Not good–」</p>

<p>With that, Fran disappeared.</p>

<p>I, who should have been in her hand, was left at the scene.</p>

<p>『<em>Eh</em>? Fran?』<br>
「Fran!」</p>

<hr>
<p> Note that the ‘Anti-Venom’ used previously is actually ‘毒消し’, which can be ‘Antidote’ as well. The reason I opted out of translating it that way is due to the fact that <em>this</em> Antidote is a Technique/Spell (アンチ・ドート) and is written in Katakana (i.e. it’s literally pronounced as it would be in English: Anti・Dote).<br>
In English, Antidote doesn’t have a space, pause, or seperater between Anti and Dote, so I can’t make use of the ‘・’ that I’ve been using to distinguish them. And so, instead of translating アンチ・ドート and 毒消し the same, I’ve made slight adjustments.<br>
As for why I’m not making the Technique ‘Anti・Venom’ instead, once again, it’s Katakana. I’d rather keep it as-is from the Raws than take creative privileges here.<br>
If anyone has a better suggestion, feel free to mention it in the comments.</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 51: Its Name is Urushi</h1>

<p>Fran disappeared.</p>

<p>She disappeared by getting caught in a Transition Trap that one of Clad’s companions set off!</p>

<p>The weapons of the two others who were caught in the trap were also left in place, just like I was. Not only their Spears, Daggers and Throwing Knives were also left behind. Similarly, Fran’s throwing equipment alongside the Dagger of the Sovereign Serpent fell beside me as well.</p>

<p>「Forced cancellation of equipped weapons…?」<br>
「Even the spare weapons were left behind…」</p>

<p>I had heard about the <em>range</em> of the Transition Trap beforehand, but they even force the cancellation of equipped weapons? If the trap was that dangerous, why wasn’t that mentioned in the explanation?! <em>Shit</em>, for even the registration to disappear…! P-Please… Stay alive… <strong><em>No</em></strong>, it’ll be alright. She <em>should</em> be alright.</p>

<p>What can I do? There must be some way to look for Fran…… There should be something capable of doing so in my various Detection Skills!</p>

<p>「Ridiculous! I’ve ne’er heard a’ such a brutal trap existin’ in this Dungeon!」<br>
「That ain’t a trap that should be in a Dungeon of this Rank!」</p>

<p>Cruz was also caught by surprise. Apparently, the trap doing this really was a bolt out of the blue.</p>

<p>「…… I think I know how this happened.」<br>
「What, what do you know?」<br>
「The Trick Spiders have a Highbreed variant called the Trickster Spider, which are known to have trap remodeling Skills.」</p>

<p>Trap remodeling Skills? In other words, they can modify the traps in the Dungeon? What a troublesome Demonic Beast! Even more, the they’re Highbreeds of <em>Trick Spiders</em>? Isn’t that bad?</p>

<p>「It was already irregular that Trick Spiders showed up, right? If Trickster Spiders are present as well, it’s not a huge surprise.」<br>
「<em>Ku…</em> Izel, the Map!」<br>
「I’ve already checked it. If the terrain’s remained the same, there should be a small room up ahead.」<br>
「I’m going!」</p>

<p>After picking up the Dagger of the Sovereign Serpent and I, Amanda breaks into a run. I’ll remain quiet for now.</p>

<p>Spiders in the surroundings pounce at Amanda all at once. <em>Oi, oi</em>. It hasn’t even been 24 hours yet! Without Grace of the Spirits, Amanda won’t be able to revive! Even if it’s Amanda, this number is–!</p>

<p>「Nuisances.」</p>

<p><strong><em>*ZAN!*</em></strong></p>

<p>Amanda’s right hand blurs, and even the Spiders that hadn’t jumped at her in the surroundings burst open instantly. One strike. With only one strike, the Spiders were wiped out. I’ve made lightly of Amanda yet again. I wasn’t even able to see her attack just now. Like this, she never got serious in her battle with Fran either, huh.</p>

<p>After a minute, we arrive at the small room. Naturally, we do so without triggering any traps.</p>

<p>「<strong><em>Fran!</em></strong>」<br>
「<em>Victor!</em> <em>Bart!</em>」</p>

<p>However, there was no one else inside the room.</p>

<p>「Even the destination of the Transition Trap was changed, it seems…」<br>
「<em>Shit</em>! Th’ hell are we gonna do?!」<br>
「We should split up and look around. However, it’d be nothing but suicide if we divided our numbers too much in the current situation. Izel, Clad, members of Roar of the Dragon and I will form a unit. Rigg and the Eyes of the Forest will form the second. Finally, Amanda will move herself, with that, we’ll have three groups.<br>
「G-Got it.」<br>
「Let’s go!」</p>

<p>With that, the Adventurers move out… But Amanda stays in place. Leaning me against the wall, she closes her eyes and concentrates. It doesn’t seem like she’s using Wind Magic…</p>

<p>Ah, she must be thinking about a method of searching for Fran. I can’t just leave this situation to the Adventurers. I have to do my best as well.</p>

<p>Telepathy is — useless. Because my Equipment Registration has been cut off, my connection to Fran was completely severed. Usually, thanks to that connection I would be able to use Telepathy even if she was far away, but… I can’t feel Fran right now. To become so uneasy simply by having our connection dissipate…! No, the anxiety Fran is feeling likely trumps mine, I must calm down!</p>

<p>If only I had an Art related to Transition, or something like a spatial leap… Anything would be fine so long as I could fly to Fran. Or, perhaps a Skill that can return Fran to me…… Are there any good Spells that can be used?</p>

<p>No, wait. Pulling Fran back just might be possible with <em>Summon Kin</em>. Fran is contracted by me, so even if our Equipment Registration was dissolved, the contract remains! And, I think I can say that Fran is my kin……</p>

<p>However, I’ve neglected verifying Summon Kin’s effects after its level had risen. I couldn’t summon anything when it was Level 1, and even after its level improved, because I don’t make contracts I figured it would be a waste of time. Thus, I didn’t check. However, things may have changed with the Skill’s raise in level. Even if the possibility is small, I’m clinging at straws here.</p>

<p>Is Fran’s name here–?</p>

<p>Hm?</p>

<p>Fran’s name isn’t listed, but instead the list of ‘kin’ I can summon are a bunch of individuals that I don’t know about.</p>

<pre>Summonable Kin: Wolf, Gray Wolf, Brown Wolf, Red Wolf, Blue Wolf, Green Wolf, Yellow Wolf, Black Wolf, Ruby Wolf, Emerald Wolf, Thunder Wolf, Onyx Wolf</pre>

<p>What on earth is this? A wolf festival? I don’t understand. I don’t remember contracting such beings at all.</p>

<p>For now, I should look at the details of each individual.</p>

<p>The first Wolf is just a common wolf. The Grey and Brown Wolves are simply wolves that evolved from regular wolves after specializing in AGI and STR respectively. The Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow Wolves are wolves that can control the attributes of Fire, Water, Wind and Soil respectively. The Black Wolf controls Darkness and Poison.</p>

<p>The Ruby Wolf is the Flame attribute Highbreed of a Red Wolf. Similarily, Emerald is the Storm attribute, and the Thunder Wolf is Lightning. The Onyx Wolf seems to be a Highbreed of the Black Wolf with control over the Darkness, Poison, and Ghost attributes.</p>

<p>Although there’re various other features, my eyes remain on one of the abilities of the Onyx Wolf. That is, the Life Perception Skill! Moreover, the Red Wolf and any proceeding wolves have the Echolocation and Keen Smell Skills. So, if it’s an Onyx Wolf, will it be able to find Fran?</p>

<p>With that thought, I decide to choose the Onyx Wolf instead of the others.</p>

<p>『――Summon・Onyx Wolf!』</p>

<p>To make sure that a strong individual appears, I pour the maximum amount of MP into the summon. I don’t know how much of an effect it’ll have, but…</p>

<p>「<strong><em>Gururuu</em></strong>」</p>

<p>From a magic formation appearing out of thin air, a Wolf with jet-black fur springs out.</p>

<p>I-It’s a bit bigger than expected. Considerably so. I thought it would be about the size of a big dog, but…… This fellow is more comparable to the size of a cow.</p>

<p>「An Onyx Wolf? In a place like this…?」</p>

<p>Dangerous. I completely forgot about Amanda. She’s super surprised. <em>Eh?</em> If it’s like this, then won’t it just be subjugated…?</p>

<p>It’s releasing a terrific amount of magic from its entire body while growling all the while as a form of intimidation… No matter how you look at it, this wolf is a hostile Demonic Beast!</p>

<p>「<em><strong>Grrrrrrr……</strong></em>」</p>

<p>Please stop. Why are you growling so much? And stop releasing your magic!</p>

<p>『Oi, stop growling! Behave yourself!』<br>
「<em>Gururr!</em>」</p>

<p>It’s no use. It’s like it’s not even listening. Should I try even harder to persuade it? Or rather, why does it look like it’s suffering? Just what’s going on?</p>

<p>State：Magic Power Discharge? That is–! That must be the reason why its magic is being dispersed all the time! Ah, is that because of me? Is it because I put too much magic power into the summoning?</p>

<p>〈Will you perform〈<strong>Christening</strong>〉on the Onyx Wolf?〉</p>

<p>At a time like this?! Should I give it a name? Let me see, a name… A name…</p>

<p>『Your name is <strong>Urushi</strong>!』</p>

<p>Jet Black contains the character Urushi, and the dark red hairs occasionally mixed in with its mane is also associated with the lacquer tree. Furthermore, the wolf has control over the Poison attribute, which relates to how a lacquer tree can give one a rash. Even though I thought about it in the spur of the moment, I think it’s a good name.</p>

<p>〈〈<strong>Christening</strong>〉of the Onyx Wolf complete〉<br>
〈Onyx Wolf is evolving〉</p>

<p>Eh? Evolution? I only named it, though? What’s going on? Is it because its magic is running out of control? Can someone explain what’s happening?</p>

<p>As I thought such things, the Onyx Wolf in front of me transformed just as the announcement said it would.</p>

<p>〈Urushi has evolved into a Darkness Wolf〉</p>

<p>「<em><strong>AOOOOooooo!</strong></em>」</p>

<p>It’s lively all of a sudden. Is its magic discharge alright?</p>

Description:
A Highbreed Wolf Demonic Beast capable of manipulating the Darkness attribute. Its Status is low compared to other Demonic Beasts of the same rank, but its Skill and Magic diversity is top-class. With many Skills related to stealth, especially the ability to hide and move within shadows, these Demonic Beasts are very difficult to find. Their existence has been confirmed, but there have been very few discoveries. Threat Level C. 

Magic Stone Location：Heart Cavity</pre>

<p>This fellow is huge. It was already quite large as an Onyx Wolf, but now it’s at least twice that size. Onyx was cattle-rank, but the tip of a Darkness Wolf’s foot to their shoulder exceeds 3 meters.</p>

<p>A sense of dignity flows from its deep, gold eyes as it glares at the surroundings. Its fangs are as sharp as daggers, and its limbs are more burly than even a bear’s. Its black hair is the only thing that it kept through its evolution, sparkling with a peculiar gleam. Ir resembles the sky of a starry night, shimmering depending on the angle it’s seen from, and holding a mysterious beauty.</p>

<p>In addition, it’s quite strong. Its Threat Level is C. Also, as its description said, its stealth-related Skills are quite considerable, with an Assassin-like Skill configuration. Its magic is also quite substantial.</p>

<p>When I compare it to the Tyrant Saber of the same rank it’s inferior physically, but their magic are leagues apart. That’s how it is.</p>

<p>「Abrupt evolution? Could this be… A Darkness Wolf? It’s my first time seeing one…」</p>

<p>For even Amanda to only see it for the first time, is a Darkness Wolf <em>that</em> rare?</p>

<p>「Moreover, there’s a flow of magic connected to Fran’s sword?」</p>

<p><em>Ugee</em>… It was completely seen through! The danger towards Urushi fell, but I have a feeling that her interest towards me rose in return…</p>

<p>「Amazing… I knew that it was a Magic Sword, but to think that it was a Demonic Beast Weapon…… Furthermore, you don’t see one with a Demonic Beast of Threat Level C lodged inside every day.」</p>

<p>Demonic Beast Weapon? Judging by her words, it seems to be a weapon that Demonic Beasts reside within. <em>Hmm</em>, so there’re weapons like that too…</p>

<p>Ah, not now, <strong><em>Fran</em></strong>!</p>

<p>『Urushi, can you understand me? If you do, raise your right paw.』<br>
「<em>Oon</em>」</p>

<p><em>*sa*</em></p>

<p>Urushi raises its right forepaw.</p>

<p>『Next, your left hind leg.』<br>
「<em>Oon</em>」<br>
『Alright, this time raise your left forepaw and right hind leg at the same time. Can you do that?』<br>
「<em>UoOon</em>」</p>

<p>Well, it seems that it can understand my words. In addition, I feel that I can understand Urushi’s feelings somehow or another. A sense of motivation is currently coming from it. Perhaps that’s thanks to Telepathy?</p>

<p>I’ll disregard Amanda muttering「C-Cute…」for now.</p>

<p>『Do you know where Fran is? She is my wielder.』<br>
「<em><strong>Oon</strong></em>」</p>

<p>Urushi smells me with a <em>*kun-kun*</em>, then closes its eyes for a couple of seconds and howls <em>*woo-woo*</em>. It seems to have been using its Skills one way or another.</p>

<p>『Well?』<br>
「<em>Aooーon!</em>」</p>

<p>Urushi howls loudly before biting onto my handle and lifting me up.</p>

<p>『I’m not heavy?』<br>
「<em>Hwuoon!</em>」</p>

<p>Because I’m in its mouth its bark sounds a bit silly, but because Urushi is huge, even if I’m being lifted with its mouth there doesn’t seem to be a problem.</p>

<p>With that, Urushi runs through the cave with a terrifying speed. Please be safe, Fran!</p>

<p>『Alright Urushi, hurry!』<br>
「<em><strong>Huohuon!</strong></em>」</p>

<hr>
<p><code>Ensig:</code><br>
There’s an Author’s note about the Transition Traps here, apologizing that their range wasn’t fully described (i.e. they work as an AoE Trap rather than a Single-Target Trap), which was already changed when I Translated said chapters.<br>
There’s also a note regarding the reason it wasn’t described in detail which, in summary, is because of the Author’s irl stuff.</p>

<p>Because we’re inhabitants of the future, I won’t translate that stuff.</p>

<hr>
<p> Urushi is the raw translation of ‘ウルシ’, which was left that way without being compounded as ‘漆’. The proper translation for both is Lacquer, or more specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicodendron_vernicifluum" target="_blank">Lacquer Trees</a>, which will explain the proceeding lines.</p>

<p> Urushi = 漆. Jet Black = 漆黒.</p>

    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 52: Heading for Fran</h1>

<p><code>Author's Note:</code><br>
It’s a bit short, sorry.</p>

<hr>
<p>Urushi, who is holding me in its mouth, runs vigorously. Will I be able to reunite with Fran just like this? No, wait, isn’t this bad?</p>

<p>「Wait! There’s a trap!」</p>

<p>Amanda shouts such words from behind. The worst possible outcome would be to have a Transition Trap activate right now.</p>

<p>『Urushi, because there’re traps here be careful!』<br>
「<em>Ohwn?</em>」<br>
『You’re unconcerned?』</p>

<p>That’s right, it has Aerial Jump Lv8, doesn’t it. So long as it doesn’t step on the trap, it won’t be activated. Furthermore, there seems to be magical power within Urushi’s eyes. I believe it’s Dark Magic, but… Hmm.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s a magic that allows one to see the locations of traps? That would explain why Urushi occasionally makes unnatural movements, seemingly avoiding something. Well, regardless, it seems that it has a trap-sensory system in place.</p>

<p>No traps have been activated at all thus far. However, after running about 300 meters from the small room, Urushi suddenly stops in place.</p>

<p>『Urushi?』<br>
「<em>Hwoon?</em>」<br>
『Where is Fran?』</p>

<p>Urushi places me on the ground and sits down in place.</p>

<p>「<em>*Hah-hah-hah-hah*</em>」<br>
『Not <em>*hah-hah</em>* –』<br>
「<em>On</em><strong><em>Oon!</em></strong>」</p>

<p>All of a sudden, Urushi starts scratching at the wall, digging with great vigor.</p>

<p>『<em>Eh</em>? Is she perhaps on the other side of that wall?』<br>
「<em>Ohn</em>」<br>
「Is Fran over there, by any chance?」</p>

<p>With a face of astonishment, Amanda approaches. Or rather, how the heck did she manage to keep up with Urushi?! — No, in terms of AGI Amanda should be higher, so perhaps that’s only natural?</p>

<p>「――Wind・Vortex!」</p>

<p>Using Storm Magic, Amanda shatters the wall.</p>

<p>『A hidden passage!』<br>
「This Dungeon… It’s because of places like this that I hate it. Even detection spells from Wind Magic wouldn’t have worked.」</p>

<p>This place must be an end location for Transition Traps, one meant solely for imprisoning people.</p>

<p>I’ve searched for presences within, but I can only feel signs of Spiders. Is she really there? I can only feel an indescribable sense of unease.</p>

<p>『Urushi, <em>go</em>!』<br>
「<em>Oon!</em>」</p>

<p>Urushi uses Aerial Jump and runs nimbly over the ground.</p>

<p>『There!』</p>

<p>Amazing, Urushi! She really was here! I can see Fran!</p>

<p>However–</p>

<p>『S-She is… Fighting…?』</p>

<p>Fran was at the far end of the passage, alive and moving.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>However, she was surrounded by small spiders. Spider larvae, most likely. Those spiders clustered around Fran one after another. Even if they’re weak alone, their number is clearly dangerous!</p>

<p>『Urushi, hurry!』<br>
「<em><strong>Hwon!</strong></em>」</p>

<p>However, I notice something strange. In Fran’s hand is something akin to a dagger, a weapon that she shouldn’t have had. What is that? Fran should have been unarmed… Was luck on her side, allowing her to find it from a treasure chest?</p>

<p>No, that’s not the case. It seems to be the Hidden Claw Necklace that we took from Gyuran. If it’s imbued with magic power a dagger-like claw protrudes from the inside, but its efficiency isn’t good.</p>

<p>『Run away, Fran!』</p>

<p>It’s no use. She’s not within the range of Telepathy yet. But why is she not running away…? The reason why Fran refused to escape despite being surrounded by spiders was clear after taking a closer look.</p>

<p>Behind her were the figures of two fallen Humans. They were Clad’s party members who had transitioned together.</p>

<p>Fran was trying to protect them.</p>

<p>『Fran!』</p>

<p><em>Damn</em>, these small fry spiders are irritating! Even if I try to use Magic, because these guys’ webs are in the way the spiders surrounding Fran wouldn’t be affected in the slightest.</p>

<p>『The level of your Sword Arts is low, Fran!』</p>

<p>Fighting in such a state is suicide!</p>

<p>I could only watch as spiders jumped on Fran. Not good! The current Fran can’t fight that number of — no. She can…?</p>

<p>Her movements are certainly slower, but the way she’s wielding the blade isn’t that bad. She cuts down a small spider and dodges the shot threads nimbly. Was Sword Arts Lv1 ever that strong? Ah, another one was cut down.</p>

<p>However, the cluster of small spiders remains on the offensive. Climbing along the wall, they’ve started aiming for the fainted Adventurers this time. Fran makes use of the Hidden Fang immediately, but it isn’t enough to stop the spiders. All at once, the Spiders pounce.</p>

<p>『Fran, don’t be reckless!』</p>

<p>Using her body as a shield, Fran puts her life on the line to protect the adventurers. With that, the fangs of the small spiders make their way into Fran’s flesh.</p>

<p>Blood…! Furthermore, a big one has…! A parent spider?!</p>

<p>With the parent spider’s momentum, she was thrown to the ground.</p>

<p>『<em><strong>UOOooooo!</strong> Mooveee!</em>』<br>
「<em><strong>OOoon!</strong></em>」</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 53: Exceeding the Limit</h1>

<p>Fran was overwhelmed by the parent spider. From the spider’s mouth, sharp fangs are clearly visible.</p>

<p>The moment I saw those… My thoughts became seething.</p>

<p>Will I be explosed to Amanda? Just what are you worrying about, foolish me! Focus on what’s important!</p>

<p>『<em><strong>UOOooooo!</strong> Mooveee!</em>』<br>
「<em><strong>OOoon!</strong></em>」<br>
『――Fire・Javelin!』</p>

<p><em>*Kyuiiiiin — <strong>BO</strong>bo<strong>OB</strong>o<strong>OB</strong>o<strong>ON</strong>!*</em></p>

<p>Urushi launches jet black arrows that mow down the spiders, and my spear of flame pierces through the obstructive cobwebs, setting them on fire in the process.</p>

<p>A little less than 20 spiders were obliterated all at once.</p>

<p>『Damn…!』</p>

<p>However, that was all.</p>

<p>Even more Spiders squirmed out at the end of the passage. Their flame resistance was considerably higher when compared to Trap Spiders.</p>

<p>『In that case――』</p>

<p>I’ll just have to pierce through with Telekinesis Catapult! It had been 10 seconds since we found Fran, and since that time I’ve continued stockpiling Telekinesis. Doing so was subconscious. It had already been ingrained as a habit. Just like how a Swordsman would place their hand on their blade’s handle at the first signs of battle, I stored Telekinesis.</p>

<p>However, until now I had hesitated to release it. I was mindful of Amanda, after all.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t just that, either. Somewhere down the line I had started feeling that it would be useless. Because I clashed against the spiders of this Dungeon, I know firsthand the hardness of the spiders and the strength of their webs. And so, I came to the understanding that a simple Telekinesis Catapult wouldn’t be enough to reach Fran.</p>

<p>And so, what was I to do?</p>

<p>『Just exceed the limit!』</p>

<p>I actually put the power of my usual Telekinesis Catapults to the ‘limit’ every time. They genuinely make use of my ‘full power’.</p>

<p>However, is there really a limit? No. There has never been such a thing.</p>

<p>The ‘limit’ I’ve used thus far was placed by myself to secure a margin of safety. It was a limit placed so that I could come out of the attack unscathed. So, if that’s how it is, then I’ll simply remove the limiter.</p>

<p><em>Exceed the limit!</em></p>

<p>My magic power rushes wildly into my blade. Even I don’t know how much magic I’ve channeled anymore! <em>However</em>, I’m still in control!</p>

<p>Not yet. I need more power! I cloak myself in flames using Sword Attribute, bringing it to the limits of my magic as well!</p>

<p>My blade becomes red-hot, glowing in the dark cave. Urushi, feeling the immense heat, releases me. I’ve reached a temperature that’s started to slightly melt my blade, so that was obvious.</p>

<p>The spiders coming from the passage, sensing the oncoming catastrophe, spew thread towards me… But it’s useless. Just by approaching my scathing form, the threads burn up and disappear.</p>

<p>『You spiders are a hindrance! <em><strong>Get out of my way!</strong></em>』</p>

<p><em>*Gyuud<strong>OOOoooOOOoooO</strong>!*</em></p>

<p>I set off the accumulated Telekinesis, resulting in an explosion.</p>

<p>With unprecedented acceleration, I incinerate and pierce through the wall of spiderwebs. The multitude of strong cobwebs that had been set up were like paper. Even with the hard shell of a spider, once touched by my flames they became nothing but cinders.</p>

<p>If it was the usual Telekinesis Catapult, I would have been trapped in the thread halfway through… But not this time. With the intensity of the heat and shockwave, any spiders in my path were crushed.</p>

<p>And with that, I was able to pass through the defensive wall built by the spiders. Just as I did so, I invoked Telekinesis Catapult once more. However, this time it was facing the opposite direction.</p>

<p>『<em><strong>UOOoooaaah!</strong></em>』</p>

<p>Presently, I’m a cannonball. Even if I don’t hit something directly, destruction spreads through the shockwave alone. And so, if I got too close to Fran she would also be damaged. Therefor, my solution is to use Telekinesis to slam on the brakes. The cobwebs can also be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>『<strong>Get away from Fran, you damn spider!</strong>』</p>

<p>I rush directly to the parent spider and, as usual, pierce its magic stone. Overcome by the Telekinesis, the spider can only convulse before being blown away.</p>

<p>After that, I use Recovery Magic on Fran immediately.</p>

<p>『――Heal!』</p>

<p>It’s a low-grade spell, but it prioritizes speed. She should be safe for the time being.</p>

<p>Now, how is she?</p>

<p>Inflicted with Deadly Poison and Light-headedness, her remaining HP is 106. I need to heal her at once! Frantically, I use Antidote and Greater・Heal, bringing her to a perfect condition.</p>

<p>『<em>Fuu</em>… I can feel relieved with this……』</p>

<p>Just in case, I use Heal and Antidote on Clad’s comrades, too. They’re idiots who rolled up Fran in their own mistakes, but I’ll forgive them for the sake of Fran who risked her life for them.</p>

<p>For now, it seems she’s fallen asleep, but what happened to the other spiders, I wonder?</p>

<p>「<em>Auun?</em>」<br>
『Urushi, when did you–! Ah! Shadow Movement, huh.』</p>

<p>How dangerous, being able to surprise even me. I had completely forgotten! If we had made use of its Shadow Movement, it would have been far easier to arrive here……</p>

<p>In the middle of the pile of spiders Urushi exterminated, it held something in its mouth. Oi, isn’t that a spider leg?!</p>

<p><em>Haa</em>… Just thinking about the food expenses for this fellow is going to give me a headache…</p>

<p>Well, it’s good that it annihilated them at least.</p>

        </div>
        

<p>『Fran. Fran?』<br>
「…… <em>Nn</em>?」<br>
『Are you awake?』<br>
「Teacher?」<br>
『<em>Ou</em>. Everything’s alright.』<br>
「The spider?」<br>
『It’s gone.』<br>
「I see.」</p>

<p>That reminds me, when I looked at Fran’s Status she achieved Sword Arts Lv3. She even gained Sword Techniques and Vigor Manipulation. Incidentally, Instantaneous Movement and Cooking also showed up. When we met, she didn’t have such Skills. It seems that even with me Equipped, Fran will still gain proficiency.</p>

<p>Furthermore, even when the Set Skills disappeared her Titles remained. Master of Fire, for example.</p>

<p>However, isn’t her growth quite fast? In a month, her Sword Arts has improved by two Levels… Perhaps that’s due to my influence? Maybe using high-level Skills has a good effect on the growth of Skills in general?</p>

<p>Regardless, her gaining Skills is of little importance right now. Even without them, Fran’s fighting spirit still would have persisted, even while poisoned and surrounded by spiders.</p>

<p>『You did well.』<br>
「Teacher: tattered.」<br>
『Well… Only a little.』</p>

<p>The compensation for using magic power beyond the limit of a regular Telekinesis Catapult was larger than I thought.</p>

<p>Combined with the magic I used to slow myself down, I consumed more than 1,200 MP. That’s more than four times the cost of a usual Telekinesis Catapult. On top of that, I only have 800 Durability remaining. Even with using Telekinesis used to slow down my momentum, that much damage was still taken. It would have been dangerous if I collided with a firm obstacle at that speed.</p>

<p>A deep crack has spreads through the middle of my blade, and the parts that had been melted by heat have become black. I’m partially destroyed without a doubt. If a common sword became like this, disposal would be immenent.</p>

<p>『When a bit of time passes, I’ll recover.』<br>
「Nn……」<br>
『Hey, hey, what’s with that face?』<br>
「My fault.」<br>
『That’s not the case. It’s the result of my foolishness. I should have controlled myself a bit more.』</p>

<p>It was more difficult to control magic beyond the usual limit than I thought. To be frank, it was difficult to adjust the amount of magic power I made use of.</p>

<p>However, through this event I think I’ve found the true value of the Sorcery Skill. So far, I’ve been looking at it as a substitute for a high rank Magic Perception Skill that can increase the power of Magic by raising the degree of magic power imbued.</p>

<p>However, it’s more than that. Because it allows me to understand the flow of magic, I can imbue magic power beyond natural limits, and because I can understand the flow of magic, I can just barely control it. An overboost of magic is possible, so to speak. Doing so is a double-edged sword, however.</p>

<p>『Well, it’s fine so long as you’re safe.』<br>
「Thank you.」</p>

<p>The deep impression of a teacher and pupil reuniting. That was the atmosphere that should have been given off… If no one else was around, that is.</p>

<p>「H-Hey… Did that sword move on its own? Moreover, it seemed to have shouted several times…… It used magic as well, and–」</p>

<p>I forgot about Amandaー! Well, I was prepared for this to some extent, but I completely forgot about her halfway through!</p>

<p>I got too impatient and shouted through Telepathy… Even though it usually only reaches who I intend it to… At the time, it was transmitted in all directions. Naturally, Amanda would have heard my voice.</p>

<p>I even used magic to fly via Telekinesis, so…</p>

<p>「Nn…」<br>
「Ah, wait. It’s alright. You don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to. I’m sorry.」<br>
「?」<br>
「It’s just, I asked you unconsciously. So, only tell me if you really want to. Everyone has their own circumstances.」</p>

<p>Even if you say that, you definitely heard me speak, right? What’s the point in hiding it? There is none, right?</p>

<p>（Teacher?）<br>
『Fran, do you want to tell Amanda?』<br>
（Nn…）</p>

<p>You’ve taken to her quite a bit, huh. Well, I had felt that was the case after the mock battle, but… Well, if Fran wants to tell her, I won’t object.</p>

<p>「Amanda.」<br>
「Yeーs?」<br>
「It’s like this ――」</p>

<p>– 3 Minutes Later –</p>

<p>Amanda is unreasonably excited.</p>

<p>「When you’re talking about Intelligent Weapons, they’re the weapons that make their own decisions, the things that’re mentioned in fairy-tales, right? <em>Kyaa!</em> They really exist!」</p>

<p>She’s surprised after seeing one for the first time. Intelligent Weapons are rare, as expected.</p>

<p>However, it seems that part of the reason for her high spirits stems from the fact that she was confided in with such a deep secret.</p>

<p>「Thank you for telling me, Fran! And… Teacher?」<br>
『<em>Ou</em>.』<br>
「Amazing… You really can speak~」<br>
『Well, please treat me well from now on.』<br>
「Yes. Same here! I’ll take the secret of you two to the grave! Also, consult me about anything you have trouble with, alright? I’ll help Fran’s friends anytime.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「I have the Title Guardian of Children, feel free to rely on me as well, alright?」<br>
「Thank you.」<br>
「<em>Aーh</em>, so cuーte! If it’s for Fran, I’ll do anything!」</p>

<p>Well, it’s good that we confided in her. I didn’t really want to do something so boorish, but I made use of Law of Lies as well. All of Amanda’s words are true. In other words, Amanda really would do anything for Fran.</p>

<p>『How nice, Fran.』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「<em>Ahh</em>, but I really want Fran to know that flustered feeling Teacher was giving off before striking the spider~! I was surprised to hear『Fran, don’t be reckless!』coming from a sword, you know?」<br>
「Teacher: flustered?」<br>
『<em>O-Ou</em>. I’m ashamed.』<br>
「Because Wolfie jumped without warning, I couldn’t provide cover fire with magic, too. It’d get caught up in it if I did… I was quite flustered, myself~!」<br>
「<em>Owuu…</em>」</p>

<p>I’m 100% no-good! In a haste-ridden panic I made error after error! There should have been way more methods to choose from! I should have requested Amanda for help or used Urushi’s Shadow Movement from the beginning…!</p>

<p><em>Haa</em>… It’s not just Fran, I have to grow up as well…</p>

<hr>
<p> Amanda calls Urushi ‘Wolf-chan’ (オオカミちゃん) here.</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 54: Urushi and Fran</h1>

<p>「This dog is?」<br>
『Dog…?』<br>
「<em>Wuu…</em>」</p>

<p>As expected, it must be pitiful to be seen as a mere dog.</p>

<p>『It’s something I summoned.』<br>
「I was surprised when it came out all of a sudden~」<br>
『Fran, this is Urushi. It’s a Darkness Wolf that, as I said, arrived via my summons.』<br>
「Urushi?」<br>
「<em>Kuun</em>」<br>
「Good boy.」</p>

<p>When Fran strokes its head, Urushi raises a joyful voice.</p>

<p>「There, there.」<br>
「<em>Whuu</em>」</p>

<p>… This guy <em>is</em> a Wolf, right? It’s acting just like a big dog would…</p>

<p>「Nn.」<br>
「<em>Hah, hah, hah</em>」<br>
「Cute.」</p>

<p>As the nape of its neck, its muzzle, and its chin are rubbed Urushi closes its eyes out of pleasure and licks Fran’s face. Hey, hey, didn’t you eat a giant Spider just a little while ago? You should probably wipe up your face, Fran…</p>

<p>Well, that aside, Fran’s safe so how should we proceed? I guess first we should meet up with the rest of the Adventurers. I was a bit impatient so I didn’t worry about it before, but this Dungeon was dangerous for Clad and Frion, right? If they ended up dying I’d have trouble sleeping at night.</p>

<p>「Hey, you guys, get up.」<br>
「<strong><em>Uu</em></strong>…… <em>Nnh</em>…」<br>
「Huh…? Where…?」<br>
「In a panic, you guys triggered a Transition Trap and got caught up in its effects.」<br>
「Ah, right, the lil’ kid was too!」<br>
「’S she a’right?」</p>

<p>It seems that after becoming unable to fight after being transferred, these two passed out due to poisoning and bleeding. However, while in a light-headed state, they caught glimpses of Fran defending them.</p>

<p>「Y’saved us.」<br>
「Thank you.」</p>

<p><em>Oh-ho</em>. The fact that they bowed their heads is worthy of praise considering they’re Clad’s companions. If they had acted haughty towards their benefactor I would have punished them a bit.</p>

<p>「<em>Ohn</em>」<br>
「<em>Uwo!</em> What’s that?!」<br>
「W-W-W-Wolf! It’s a Demonic Beast!」</p>

<p>They didn’t react very well, huh. They’re finding it hard to even stand up — or should I say that they’ve been completely paralyzed from shock? They’re just sitting on their backsides looking up at Urushi with desperate expressions.</p>

<p>「A-A-Amanda! Please, save us!」<br>
「<em>Oou?</em>」<br>
「<em>Hii!</em> Its tongue! Its tongue is–!」<br>
「Urushi, no.」<br>
「<em>KUUuuu…</em>」</p>

<p>When Amanda explains that Urushi is Fran’s companion the two manage to settle down.</p>

<p>「T’ make such an ‘ighly ranked Demonic Beast yer companion…!」<br>
「S’ th’ first time I’ve seen a Demonic Beast Weapon!」</p>

<p>After saying so, their eyes became full of respect towards Fran once again. They’re completely captivated by Fran. It seems like they’ll begin calling her ‘Big Sis’ any moment now.</p>

<p>「Ah, anyways, what’ll we do now?」<br>
「Yeah, where’re th’ others?」<br>
「They went looking for you guys.」</p>

<p>How should we go about finding everyone else…?</p>

<p>「Urushi: look for Humans?」<br>
「<em><strong>Oon!</strong></em>」</p>

<p>With that, Urushi laid down and stared at Fran.</p>

<p>「Ride?」<br>
「<em>On, Oon!</em>」<br>
「Nn. Thank you.」<br>
「Oh my, it’s quite intelligent, isn’t it?」</p>

<p>Urushi’s back is still high up even when it lays down, so Fran simply climbs up.</p>

<p>「Soft…」<br>
「<em>Aun!</em>」</p>

<p>Fran holds onto the back of Urushi’s neck, and I fix her in place using Telekinesis. Like this, she won’t be shaken off.</p>

<p>But what should we do about Adventurer A and B? They won’t be able to keep up with us on foot, but it’s dangerous if we leave them here. Should we ask Amanda to escort them?</p>

<p>「Urushi: carry?」<br>
「<em>Onn</em>」</p>

<p>Urushi gently looks up at Fran and gives her a short nod.</p>

<p>「Like dogs?」<br>
「Huh? Tha’s kinda abrupt, lil’ lady… Dogs… Well, I guess I like dogs, but–」<br>
「Alright.」<br>
「Eh? <em>Uoo–!</em>」</p>

<p>Urushi lifts the nape of Adventurer A’s leather armor with its mouth, just like how a parent cat would carry its kittens.</p>

<p>『Are you alright with giving them a lift?』<br>
（<em>Wafuun!</em>）</p>

<p>Well, alright, but don’t pick up Fran like that.</p>

<p>「Then, I’ll carry you.」<br>
「Eh? Amanda will?」<br>
「That’s right, so behave yourself alright?」<br>
「<em>Uwaa!</em>」</p>

<p>Amanda picked up Adventurer B and placed him under her arm despite him clearly being larger than her. What an odd sight to behold.</p>

</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>「Then, let’s go.」<br>
「<em>Hwoooon!</em>」</p>

<p>With that, Urushi starts running. By the way, I’ve been sheathed and am assuming my usual position on Fran’s back. I’ve sealed up the crack on my blade for the time being, but I should wait until we leave the dungeon for a complete recovery. Until then, I’ll just have to patiently settle with emergency repairs.</p>

<p>「Urushi: amazing. Running through the sky.」<br>
『That’s thanks to Aerial Jump Lv8.』</p>

<p>Unlike Aerial Jump Lv1 that we possess with effects similar to multistage jumping, Lv8 allows Urushi to perfectly run through the air. It seems that it’s quite a pleasant experience for Fran.</p>

<p>「Spiders ahead.」</p>

<p>5 Trick Spiders can be seen heading towards us.</p>

<p>「Go.」<br>
「<em>Hhwoon!</em>」</p>

<p><em>Oi, oi</em>, Urushi, even if you don’t plan on slowing down there’s no reason to speed up, right? Even the pitiful screams of the Adventurers are being ignored.</p>

<p>「<em>Huhoon!</em>」</p>

<p>Called upon by Urushi’s roar, jet black spears rain down on the spiders. Furthermore, the spiders on the left and right were torn to pieces and scattered about just as Urushi entered the next passageway. Most likely, it was Urushi’s doing when its forepaws moved at lightning speed.</p>

<p>『――Flare・Blast!』<br>
「――Fire・Arrow」<br>
「――Wind・Cutter!」</p>

<p>In the nest-covered passageway, magic is fired in rapid succession to create a way through. Although the strength of the nests themselves are considerable, they’re unable to endure the continuous barrage. Like that, we run through the cave without stopping while eliminating any spiders along the way.</p>

<p>「There’s no response.」<br>
「<em>Hii… Hii…</em>」<br>
「<em>Ha… Hah…</em>」</p>

<p>Amanda mutters so with a composed expression, while the two Adventurers look like they’re barely holding onto their lives.</p>

<p>After running for a while, we arrive in front of an especially large passage. Inside was a large amount of spiders. Because of the numerous nests set up in the vicinity it’s hard to see, but seriously, the number of spiders here is amazing. However, the presence of Humans can also be felt. Most likely, these presences belong to Cruz and the others. How is it that they managed to break through to this point? Perhaps there’s an alternate entrance?</p>

<p>Well, either way, we won’t be stopped by something of this level. Firing magic in rapid succession, we break through the passage and arrive at some sort of great hall. It’s about double the size of the room we fought Army Beetles in at the Goblin Nest.</p>

<p>Spiders jostled around in such a room. Not only on the floor, nests had been set up all over the ceiling and walls, amounting to more than 50 total. Inside that spider-filled hall was Cruz, as well as the others. Isn’t it unreasonably dangerous to challenge this room with their fighting potential? Testament to that, they were cornered against a wall. Some of them had Status abnormalities.</p>

<p>「Damn it, e’en if I cut an’ slice ’em…!」<br>
「If the path of retreat wasn’t blocked off…!」</p>

<p>It seems that they went too far in and got trapped.</p>

<p>At the center of the spiders was a remarkably large spider. Poisonous-looking purple hair is grown over its entire body, arousing a feeling of discomfort.</p>

Description:
A Highbreed of the Trick Spider species, this demonic beast makes use of traps while hunting. Its ability to modify traps with the Trap Remodeling Skill in Dungeons is particularly troublesome, with turning simple Poison Spray Traps into fatal ones, or redesigning Transition Traps to lead to their own nests being notable examples. Its physical abilities are low, making it weak in close combat. Threat Level C. 

Magic Stone Location: Head</pre>

<p>So it was present in the Dungeon after all. A Trickster Spider. Its Status far surpasses the other spiders, too.</p>

<p>It’s the boss of the spiders that caused Fran to have a terrible experience!</p>

<p>『Alright, let’s take our revenge!』<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「<em><strong>OOooon!</strong></em>」</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 55: Do Tricksters Feel Fear?</h1>

<p>Just as I raised a shout in front of the hoard of spiders, I heard a pitiable scream.</p>

<p>「<em>Uwaa</em>! H-Help!」<br>
「Leader!」<br>
「Big bro!」</p>

<p>Adventurer A was already released, and B rushed forward in a panic.</p>

<p><em>Hmm</em>. It appears that Clad’s been wound up with thread, rendered to a state that he’d probably be dragged into the cobwebs. Rather than being Poisoned, he’s been Paralyzed. He’s in quite a pinch.</p>

<p>『Shall we help? Urushi, to the Adventurers.』<br>
「<em>Onn</em>」<br>
「Nn. ――Fire・Arrow!」</p>

<p>Magic is cast to burns down the spider’s cobwebs, but…</p>

<p>「<em>Achichichi</em>! Hot!」</p>

<p>The flames streamed down the thread, coiling around Clad himself as well. His hair might get a bit singed, but he won’t die.</p>

<p>「<em><strong>AOOoooooon!</strong></em>」</p>

<p>With that Urushi unleashed jet black arrows, defeating the spiders surrounding the Adventurers. I don’t know if the spiders are intelligent enough to consciously feel fear, but after witnessing Urushi’s strength they edged back.</p>

<p>Well, the reactions of the Adventurers was more terrible, though.</p>

<p>「<em><strong>Uwaaa!</strong></em>」<br>
「W-What the hell is this guy?!」<br>
「<em>Hii</em>! This magic power is…!」<br>
「A-an Onyx Wolf?」<br>
「Idiot! This is way stronger!」<br>
「I di’n hear anythin’ ’bout this!」<br>
「Damn it…! Everyone calm down!」</p>

<p>They had just been struggling against Rank E Demonic Beasts, so it’s understandable that they’d fall into a panic when something of a higher rank appeared in front of them.</p>

<p>「No, wait! Amanda’s over there!」<br>
「An’ on its back, ain’t that the lil’ lady?!」<br>
「Ehh?」</p>

<p>They seem to have noticed somehow or another. With this, we won’t have to worry about Cruz jumping out and attacking. Alright, as for our arch-nemesis the Trickster Spider――</p>

<p>「Bleed out and die!」</p>

<p><em>*Do<strong>GASHK</strong>*</em></p>

<p>「This is the consequence of doing such a terrible thing to Fran!」</p>

<p>Amanda’s whip was breaking the Trickster Spider into pieces. Its Magic Stone was being shattered, too.</p>

<p>Well, of course it’d be an instant kill. Trickster Spiders are only Threat Level C due to how troublesome they are with the Trap Remodeling Skill, right? In terms of status, they’re closer to Threat Level D. Still, to be finished off so easily…</p>

<p>『<em>Eh</em> ―― Ms. Amanda…?』<br>
「Eh?」</p>

<p>I sent Telepathy to Amanda unintentionally.</p>

<p>「<em>Ah!</em>」</p>

<p>Turning in place, Amanda’s has an expression of ‘I really did it now!’ plastered on her face.</p>

<p>I had told her about my ability to absorb Magic Stones only a short while ago. In fact, didn’t she promise to give us the Trickster Spider’s Magic Stone? Wasn’t it something like an unspoken agreement? No, maybe it was foolish to believe her carefree ‘I’ll hand it over~’?</p>

<p>In that case, I, who didn’t make her promise properly, am in the wrong…</p>

<p>「W-Well, now we can take out the rest of the spiders!」</p>

<p>She’s trying to gloss it over!</p>

<p>「Right, Fran!」</p>

<p>… It can’t be helped. We should give priority to exterminating the other spiders for now.</p>

<p>「Nn, let’s do it.」<br>
「<em>Grruuuu!</em>」<br>
『In that case, let’s make them feel the true meaning of despair!』</p>

<p>As a barrage of Fire Magic is immediately released, the frenzied dance of Magic began.</p>

<p>Amanda’s Wind Magic cut down the spiders on the ceiling together with their nests, Urushi’s Dark Magic skewered the spiders to the walls, and our Fire Magic burnt down the spiders over wide areas. Even Frion participated, binding the spiders in place by wrapping ivy coils around their bodies.</p>

<p>The best part, however, was when Amanda used Storm Magic on the ceiling, finishing off all the spiders all at once. Perhaps this is Amanda being serious? The magic didn’t affect the Adventurers at all… It was perfectly under control.</p>

<p>「As expected of Amanda.」<br>
「<em>Ohー</em>? I was praised by Fran!」</p>

<p>Her bashful figure in response to being praised doesn’t seem strong at all, though.</p>

<p>Once we finished, what was left of the spiders was littered across the floor. Although they’re quite tattered, there should be usable materials here and there. Magic Stones should also be scattered about.</p>

<p>『Urushi, look for Magic Stones.』<br>
「<em>Auf</em>」</p>

<p>At the very least I have to secure a Magic Stone from a Trick Spider, so I asked Urushi to reserve a couple of them for me. Urushi, who has a good nose, found them one after another.</p>

<p>Moreover, it’s stowing away them inside of the shadows. It’s an application of Shadow Lurk, most likely. How convenient.</p>

<p>「You two, um, er… That wolf…」</p>

<p>Cruz and the others approach cautiously. They made it out alive, but it seems that some of them are in pain. The Poison in their bodies must have started taking effect.</p>

</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>『Fran.』<br>
「Nn. ――Antidote! Anti・Paralyze!」<br>
「<em>Ooh…</em>! We’re saved!」</p>

<p>Frion sat down on the spot, probably out of relief. There was even a guy who started crying. Well, it’s good that no one ended up dying.</p>

<p>「So, this fellow… Is it possibly an Onyx Wolf?」<br>
「Different. Darkness Wolf.」<br>
「Ehh?」<br>
「This is the first one I’ve seen!」<br>
「Seriously…?」</p>

<p>So noisy. Well, it’s a rare Demonic Beast that even Amanda hadn’t seen before, but…</p>

<p>「Miss Fran?」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「I’ve never seen such a strong Summon before… Rather, Isn’t it a bit strange that you’re only Rank D if you can summon this?」</p>

<p>Frion’s eyes shine while he watches Urushi, seemingly losing his inner battle against his curiosity. Perhaps he’s a researcher-type?</p>

<p>Anyways, doesn’t it stick out a bit too much? We’ll attract too much attention when we get back to town… And whether it could even stay in an inn is questionable.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I’ve tried to un-summon Urushi, but it doesn’t look like it’s possible. It seems that it’s the type of summon that simply remains summoned.</p>

<p>Also on that note, with normal Summoning, magic is consumed so long as the Summon is around. In this case, however, magic was only consumed during the Summoning process. I’m quite thankful for that.</p>

<p>『Urushi. Using Shadow Lurk, can you hide in Fran’s shadow?』<br>
（<em>Ohn</em>）</p>

<p>After responding via Telepathy, Urushi sinks into Fran’s shadow. <em>Ohh</em>, it was instantaneous. Furthermore, there’s no sign of it at all. Because I have the Sorcery Skill I can just barely identify its presence, but it would be extremely difficult for lower-ranked Adventurers to notice.</p>

<p>『When it town, can you possibly remain inside her shadow?』<br>
「<em>Kuu</em>……」<br>
『No good?』<br>
「<em>Onn</em>」<br>
『It’s just that you’d stick out a bit too much in town. It’s possible that you’ll be attacked on sight, you know?』<br>
「<em>Ouu…</em>」</p>

<p>Urushi’s ears lay flat with a <em>*petan*</em>, making what seems to be a sad expression.<em>Muu</em>… Even if you make a face like that, it’s not like you were forced into her shadow.</p>

<p>（Teacher, a plea from me as well.）<br>
『No, but that’s…』<br>
（No good?）<br>
（<em>Ohnon?）</em></p>

<p>How sly! Having four round eyes directed at me is no fair! To the people in the surroundings, this is only a strange scene of a man and beast staring at one another, though.</p>

<p>「<em>Oon!</em>」<br>
『What? Did you detect something?』<br>
「<em><strong>Aooo</strong>oon</em>」</p>

<p>Ohh? With its howl, Urushi began shrinking! Within seconds it became the size of a common large-sized dog.</p>

<p>『Is this perhaps the Shapeshift Skill? I had thought that it was a Skill that allowed its user to change its form to another Demonic Beast…』<br>
「<em>On, oon</em>」<br>
「<em>Kyaーa</em>! It became so small! It’s so cute! <em>Ahh</em>, I want one too!」</p>

<p>No no, it’s small if you compare its size from a minute ago, but it’s still plenty large… Well, if it’s like this, maybe it’s tolerable for town?</p>

<p>『<em>Haa</em>… It can’t be helped. Can you retain this form when we’re in town?』<br>
「<em><strong>Onn!</strong></em>」<br>
（Thank you Teacher. With this I can mofumofu Urushi all the time.）</p>

<p>Fran, was that your reason for pleading with me…? Well, I want to mofumofu Urushi as well, you know!</p>

<p>A-Anyways, there’s no helping it. I’m the one who summoned it, so I have to take care of it properly. When the time comes, should we take it out on walks? On that note, I guess there’s no real need for a leash? Hm… It’s really turned into the feeling of having a pet dog, huh.</p>

<p>「Best regards mofumo– Urushi.」<br>
「<em>Oon?</em>」</p>

<hr>
<p> Adventurer B shouts out ‘クラッドの兄貴’ or ‘Clad-aniki’. Because I’ve been fully changing the text to English and simply ignoring honorific titles (while sometimes mentioning them in Footnotes), putting in -aniki here would be out of place. Thus the translation.</p>

<p> Since there was a chapter that had ‘mofumofu’ in the title, I’m not sure if this needs mentioning, but… ‘mofumofu’ (モフモフ) is literally ‘soft to the touch’, but in context it essentially means ‘cuddle’. It can also be used as a sound effect which is why, to my understanding, it’s used as an onomatopoeia regardless of context.<br>
Still, because I’ve been fully translating the text to English, I’m willing to change it if that’s desired. Leave a comment.</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>Chapter 56: The Core Room</h1>

<p><code>Ensig:</code><br>
The Author made a note of changing one of Amanda’s lines in Chapter 53, but it’s just a grammatical error.<br>
They also changed the Trickster Spider’s threat level from C to D in Chapter 54. Because these changes were already made prior to this Translation, I won’t bother translating them.</p>

<p>※ ※ ※</p>

<p>After exterminating the spiders our party made its way to the Dungeon Core room.</p>

<p>「That over there is the Magic Ore.」<br>
「<em>Hooh</em>. So this is Magic Ore in its purest form? It’s quite amazing.」<br>
「Ain’t this th’ same as a pile a’ treasure?!」</p>

<p>Clad’s eyes shine as he rushes towards the Magic Ore.</p>

<p>「<em>Pu–</em>」<br>
「Don’t you laugh, damn it! Jus’ who d’you think is at fault fer this!」<br>
「Your life-saver.」<br>
「<em>Gu–</em>」<br>
「The cost of life.」<br>
「I-I know already!」</p>

<p>Clad’s hair had been burnt from Fran’s Fire Magic, so it was shaved off. However, because it was a bit hard to cut it all using a dagger, several places remained unshaven. It’s amusing to look at, no matter how many times I see it. The fact that we could have solved his hair issue using Greater・Heal is a secret.</p>

<p>「<em>Pfhuhu</em>…」<br>
「Shit…」</p>

<p>Every time Amanda and Fran looked towards him, they fought a losing battle against their withheld laughter.</p>

<p>「Yeah, yeah. Now then, Ms. Amanda: please collect the Magic Ore.」<br>
「Ok.」<br>
「Everyone who has an Item Bag, please do so as well.」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>Anyways, there sure is a lot of it. The Core room is completely filled with high-purity Magic Ore ingots. If I’m not mistaken, Magic Ore is quite precious, and is useful when making weapons.</p>

<p>「I’m sure you’re all aware, but information regarding this place is confidential. Upon speaking about it the Pledge will immediately be broken, thus notifying not only the Guild, but the Country as well. That being the case, please be careful.」<br>
「We had no problem entering because we had permission, in the case an outsider enters the vicinity a Barrier would immediately detect them.」<br>
「Fran should be careful too, ok? Otherwise the Guild Master will become noisy.」<br>
「Why go so far?」<br>
「Well, there’s a lot of Magic Ore here, right?」<br>
「Yes?」<br>
「That’s exactly why. Characteristics between Dungeons Cores vary, most notably regarding the amount of magic power needed to produce certain items. In this Dungeon, Magic Ore with high purity can be created with very little magic power.」</p>

<p>I see, so that’s why it isn’t open to the public.</p>

<p>After all the Magic Ore was packed away, Cruz took a look at the Core’s settings. If its state is as normal, only Trap Spiders should be listed as spawns.</p>

<p>「How is it, Cruz? Are all the Trick Spiders exterminated?」<br>
「It’s reported back more than one species.」</p>

<p>Although their numbers were significantly reduced, the Trick Spiders weren’t fully subjugated. In this case, if we leave them alone they’ll just start breeding again. It’s also possible that another Trickster Spider is out there. If we leave things as they are, not only will the difficulty of the Dungeon will be raised, but the recovery of Magic Ore will become considerably harder as well.</p>

<p>There is, however, a good point to leaving the situation as it is.</p>

<p>In comparison to Trap Spiders, the materials from Trick Spiders are more useful, and thus more expensive. If they’re recovered on a regular basis, it wouldn’t be bad by any means. Furthermore, the Trick Spiders provide more magic power to the Core. As a result, the production of Magic Ore would also be influenced positively.</p>

<p>「Well, in cases like this ain’t it better t’ leave th’ decision t’ th’ Guild?」<br>
「That’s indeed the case. On top of that, we’ll have to report the finding of Human Bones.」</p>

<p>As it happens, we ended up finding what seemed to be brand-new bones within the hall we exterminated the hoard of spiders in. Moreover, there were enough for almost 10 people. Judging by their condition, we arrived at the conclusion that the individuals had died one or two months ago.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

        </div>
        

<p>And yet, according to Cruz, reports of deaths in this Dungeon hadn’t occurred for several years.</p>

<p>So, just where did all of those bones come from? A Barrier that perceives intruders made by an A Rank Adventurer with the nickname ‘Barrier Salesman’ is in effect at the Dungeon’s entrance, so it should have been difficult for anyone to get in without permission, and yet… Well, it’s quite the mystery.</p>

<p>「Then, for now let’s return.」</p>

<p>◇◆◇</p>

<p>In regards to the journey back, there weren’t any particular problems. Fran was defeated in a mock battle against Amanda again.</p>

<p>Urushi joined in as well, but both of them were beaten up. That being said, their cooperation improved considerably thanks to that battle; even Amanda was surprised.</p>

<p>Urushi’s fighting style has a high level of versatility. First is in regards to its Magic. With the ability to use both Dark Magic and Poison Magic, it can play an active role through both frontal attacks, and attacks from unusual angles.</p>

<p>Second, with its Fang Techniques its direct attacks aren’t something to scoff at. In particular, its use of Shadow Movement is terrific. It’s the kind of surprise attack that a Fiend would use, but in Urushi’s case, it’s actually more efficient. It can attack using Dark Magic without exposing its body by hiding inside of shadows, and its ability to transition in and out of Fran’s shadow at unexpected times could be seen as downright dirty. The distance it can transition in is a bit short, but that’s not much of a problem in combat.</p>

<p>If the Demon from a while back could utilize magic in this way, we would have had no choice but to run away.</p>

<p>Anyways, as thanks for the training, we were taught a bit about about〈Christening〉. As a result, it was discovered that the reason for Urushi’s evolution was undoubtedly Christening. Still, Fran had given me a name, so why was it that nothing happened?</p>

<p>Through Amanda’s explanation, I figured that out as well.</p>

<p>Christening is essentially the act of a higher-ranked individual giving a name to a subordinate or retainer. However, not only a name is gained. Through Christening, something akin to a contract is formed, strengthening the connection between both parties’ souls.</p>

<p>The receiver of the name has their potential released, resulting in a raise in Status among a variety of other benefits.</p>

<p>In the case of Fran and I, she wasn’t regarded as a higher ranked individual. So, while I gained a name, the act of receiving it wasn’t exactly the same as taking part in the Christening ritual.</p>

<p>In Urushi’s case, its potential was let loose and it evolved. Furthermore, it fully received the excess magic power that was running rampant in its body. In the case that I put off Christening… It most likely would have gone out of control, only to be subdued by Amanda. I’m very sorry, Urushi. You were in quite the pinch.</p>

<p>Anyways, the information I wanted to know most — the reason why Demonic Beasts of the Wolf type appeared in Summon Kin — remains unknown. I managed to infer a little, but there’s just not enough information.</p>

<p>I’d like to research that alongside more detailed information on Magic in the library but… Well… Places where one has to sit still for long periods of time are Fran’s weak point.</p>

<p>I suppose when it comes to fishing she’d be able to manage, though. Most things seem possible at the mention of all-you-can-eat curry.</p>

<p><em>Mhh</em>. On the note of food, the size of the servings she’s been eating have been increasing lately. She’ll be dashing straight into the Gluttonous Character archetype if I leave it alone… I should definitely reduce the amount I’m serving her.</p>

<p><em>Ahh~</em>, but I become so weak when she stares at me with those eyes. With Urushi in the picture, that stare’s power has been amplified by two~</p>

        <h1>Chapter 57: Returning to Aressa</h1>

<p><code>Ensig:</code><br>
The Author left a note at the start and end of this chapter, relating to a double release the day of this chapter’s posting, alongside the reason for it. I won’t bother translating it because there’s no need.</p>

<p>For those of you who don’t find these chapters through my Posts here, note that there’s now another person working with me on Sword-shisho: , otherwise known as Pengu. They’ll be translating on Fridays/Saturdays, while I’ll translate Sun-Thurs.</p>

<p>When I feel like it, that is.</p>

<p>I’ll put a note at the top of the chapter on who the TL and Editor are from now on.</p>

<hr>
<p>◇ The day after we set out to return ◇</p>

<p>We’ve finally returned to the town of Aressa… But there’s a bit of a commotion at the front gate.</p>

<p>『What’s all the fuss about?』<br>
「Lots of people.」</p>

<p>Certainly, a large number of Humans have gathered. I think I’ve seen them somewhere before, but… Where?</p>

<p>「Kinghts, huh. What’s goin’ on?」</p>

<p>Cruz’s words jogged my memory. Their armor looks just like the set that Auguste was wearing. In fact, the man leading the group had armor even more luxuriously decorated than his.</p>

<p>「Small fry knights.」<br>
「My my, that’d well said.」<br>
「Hey, wait a minute both of you… Please make sure not to say such things in front of the Knights! The only strong thing about them is their pride!」<br>
「I know, I know.」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>I understood as well. To be frank, the public’s impressions of the Chivalric Orders was low, but it wasn’t to the level that they would openly antagonize towards them. Why was it that the Knights themselves picked quarrels despite that fact, I wonder?</p>

<p>『Well, for now… Urushi, make sure to stay quiet, alright?』<br>
「<em>Onn</em>」</p>

<p>It’s already in its miniature form, but Urushi’s still attracting a decent amount attention. It’d be troublesome if the Knights quibbled with us because of this fact.</p>

<p>「Well, it’s fine, isn’t it? The leader seems to be Urs.」</p>

<p>That reminds me, the Guild Master had said that their leader was a respectable man.</p>

<p>「<em>Ohh</em>, is that you, Ms. Amanda?」<br>
「Yeah. It’s been a while.」<br>
「Indeed it has! Having you here is quite reassuring!」</p>

<p>He’s quite the lively old man, isn’t he? He’s shorter than Donna, but their expressions are largely the same. 一 He could be described solely with the words ‘Dandy Macho‘.</p>

<pre>Name: Urs・Bendoro 　Age: 52 
Race: Human 
Job: Shield Knight 
State: Normal 
Status:　Level: 50 
HP: 527　MP: 223　STR: 218　END: 274　AGI: 132　INT: 103　MGC: 119　DEX: 122 
Skills: 
Coercion: Lv3, Pugilist Arts: Lv4, Hardening: Lv4, Danger Perception: Lv2, Horsemanship: Lv4, Leadership: Lv6, Shield Techniques: Lv8, Shield Arts: Lv8, Abnormal Status Resistance: Lv4, Spear Techniques: Lv3, Spear Arts: Lv6, Provocation: Lv7, Poison Resistance: Lv7, Magic Perception: Lv2, Vigor Manipulation, END ↑, Fortitude 
Titles: 
Baron, Leader of Aressa's Knights, Defender 
Equipment: 
High-Quality Mithril Spear, High-Quality Adamantite Kite Shield, Sturdy Silver Full-Body Armor, Red Lion Mantle, Bracelet of Mental Abnormality Resistance</pre>

<p>He seems to be a bit stronger than Donna. However, while Donna is an attack-type Heavy-Warrior, Urs is a defense-type Heavy-Knight.</p>

<p>「Has something happened?」<br>
「Yeah. There was a reaction to the Barrier. It seems that there’s a Demonic Beast of Threat Level C nearby.」<br>
「So you’re heading out to subjugate it?」<br>
「That’s right. First, we have to place restrictions to the outside of the town, then we’ll investigate the surroundings with a fine-toothed comb. We’ve issued a request for support from the Guild, too.」</p>

<p><em>Hmm</em>. He really is an upright man, isn’t he? He’s something like a stereotypical Knight.</p>

<p>「There’re a lot of young Knights…」<br>
「<em>Ah</em>, they’ve joined the order for various reasons. A purge was performed, you see. Once the problematic people disappeared, the motivation from the youngsters increased.」</p>

<p>The ‘problematic people’ stemmed from Auguste, no doubt about it. Once he and his followers disappeared, more proper Knights must have taken their place.</p>

<p>Anyways, a Demonic Beast of Threat Level C, huh? It couldn’t be–</p>

<p>Immediately, the eyes of the Adventurers who participated in the Dungeon investigation turned to Urushi, who sat itself down beside Fran.</p>

<p>「Urushi.」<br>
「<em>On</em>」<br>
「<em>Muoo!</em> T-That is… A Demonic Beast? Even if it’s small, what a dreadful amount of magic power…!」<br>
「Most likely, the Demonic Beast you guys detected was none other than Urushi.」<br>
「…… Is it Ms. Amanda’s familiar?」<br>
「Nope. This is Fran’s pet.」<br>
「I see. This young lady…? Hm. Is she perhaps the girl who wields a Magic Sword from the rumors?」</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>It seems that the name of the before-mentioned Magic Sword wielding girl hasn’t spread.</p>

<p>「Well, if it’s familiar then it’s fine, but… Can you distinguish it somehow?」<br>
「Understood. Next time, wrap with a scarf before passing through. Have to issue a Familiar license later?」<br>
「Got it. How about I just ask you a couple of questions for now, and I’ll write down your answers on the official documentation?」<br>
「Thoughtful.」<br>
「Then first, you’re positive this is a Darkness Wolf, correct?」<br>
「Nn.」</p>

<p>After taking out a small piece of parchment, Urs starts writing. It seems that an official certificate is absolutely necessary to have a familiar.</p>

<p>「Aーnd… What’s its name?」<br>
「Urushi.」<br>
「Urushi. And you? What’s your name?」<br>
「Fran.」<br>
「Next, what’s it’s gender?」<br>
「…? One moment.」</p>

<p>Hm? That reminds me, I didn’t check that either. It didn’t think about that at all.</p>

<p>「<em>Hyuuin</em>!」</p>

<p><em>Kyaー</em>, Fran, how bold! She just walked behind Urushi, lifted up its tail, and confirmed whether or not anything was there! P-Perhaps it’s simply because she’s a child…? To Urushi, this whole ordeal must be a disaster.</p>

<p>「Male.」<br>
「<em>Kuuuuun……</em>」<br>
「O-Oh. Is that so.」</p>

<p>◇◆◇</p>

<p>After tying a red scarf around Urushi’s neck, we were granted entry into Aressa. In accordance to the Familiar contract, we also received a crest to show that he was tame. It seems it’s meant to be put on a collar or a similar item.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the Adventurer’s Guild, there was a small uproar.</p>

<p>「…… Seriously, this time it’s a C ranked familiar? It’s not like you were a popular topic already or anything.」</p>

<p>Right after opening his mouth, the Guild master threw that sarcasm at us. Still, it can’t really be helped. When any meddlesome Adventurers got in our way to the Guild Master’s office, Urushi returned to its true size and bit their heads. Of course, he didn’t kill them or anything; it was just simple play-biting. They <em>were</em> left half-dead and covered in blood because of it, though.</p>

<p>「And on top of being a Darkness Wolf, it’s a Unique individual? Even though it’s already a rare race…」</p>

<p>What? Unique individual? There’s no way I overlooked something like that. Isn’t Urushi just a regular Darkness Wolf?</p>

<p>「Unique individual? Urushi is?」<br>
「Oh, you didn’t notice? Normal Darkness Wolves have completely jet-black fur, but this fellow has red mixed in at the edges. Because it’s tucked into the scarf, it’s a bit hard to see. In addition to that, it has a Unique Skill. A regular Darkness Wolf wouldn’t have something like that. Even if it was only Level 1, having one means it’s a Unique individual.」</p>

<p>Seriously? I didn’t know about that at all… I had never seen other Darkness Wolves, so I thought Urushi was the norm.</p>

<p>「Well, setting that aside… For accomplishing my request, thank you. With Amanda vouching for your strength as well as the addition of your familiar, people won’t be making light of you anymore. Amanda’s recognition in particular will spread through Merchants and Adventurers like wildfire, so when you arrive at Urmut it’ll probably be a common rumor.」<br>
「Nn.」<br>
「Please make sure to take your Guild Card to the reception desk later. It’ll be stamped to grant you entrance to Urmut’s Dungeons.」</p>

<p>Alright, alright! With this, we can do Dungeons.</p>

<p>「Nn. Then, leaving.」<br>
「<em>Ahh</em>, may I suggest confirming the status of your Job while you’re there? A Job increase might be possible, after all. Usually it’s 500 Gorudo, but I don’t mind waiving the fee this time. Think of it as a farewell gift.」</p>

<p>A farewell gift, huh… So stingy! We’ll accept it, though.</p>

<p>「Thank you.」<br>
「When will you leave for Urmut?」<br>
「Soon.」<br>
「I see. It’ll be a bit lonely.」<br>
「…… You don’t mean it.」<br>
「<em>Hahaha</em>. That’s not true. For better or for worse, you’ve impressed me. But, with this, my quiet daily life will return once more.」<br>
「Nn. Take care.」</p>

<p>Seeing Fran lower her head with a <em>*pekori*</em>, the Guild Master’s eyes went round. He seems pretty surprised. So Fran can do stuff like this too, huh?</p>

<p><em><strong>*BAKAN*</strong></em></p>

<p>「<em>Fuu</em>. I kept being surprised right to the end.」</p>

                    <br>

        <h5><strong>Chapter 58: Klimt – side story</strong></h5>



<p>Knock* Knock*</p>





<p>「Enter.」</p>

<p>「Uncle, I’ve prepared the report.」</p>

<p>「Ah, Frion. You came at a good time.」</p>



<p>It was my nephew, Frion, who entered my office. Recently since there were many people who rudely entered my room without waiting for an answer, they seem to have forgotten that I’m the guild master. In this aspect, Frion is courteous. Taking a lesson from that, I would like to protest against the various unclear rumors.<br>
「Please, sit.」</p>

<p>「Thank you very much.」</p>

<p>「Thank you for your hard work. There seem to have been various irregularities this time around, but…」</p>

<p>「There were many times that I almost died.」</p>



<p>The appearance of the Trickster Spider and the mysterious pile of human bones, is it? These problems were giving me a headache. Still, the discovery of the human bones was quite lucky.</p>



<p>「Uncle, about those bones…」</p>

<p>「Yes. I believe that some of them were the remains of Auguste Alsund.」</p>



<p>Actually, one of Auguste’s subordinates had confessed about a certain ploy. That is, the smuggling of Magic Ore using Transfer Stones.</p>

<p>Transfer Stones are magic tools composed of a pair of stones. When stone A is used, the holder is transported to stone B. However, because they can only be used once on top of being very expensive, they usually aren’t amassed in large quantities.</p>

<p>Auguste’s plan consisted of placing one such Transfer Stone inside of the Dungeon, as to return later without being sensed by the barrier and steal Magic Ore.</p>

<p>If I’m not mistaken, this plan would have commenced three months ago, when he declared his interest of inspecting the Dungeon and went in by force. Of course, I didn’t lend him any Adventurers for something he was doing of his own convenience, so with their forces alone, it would have been impossible to fully traverse the Dungeon.</p>

<p>Sure enough, they were unable to get past the third floor, forcing them to turn back. As it turned out, however, they had used that occasion to set up a Transfer Ore in secret. I had conducted a personal investigation later, but nothing had caught my attention at the time. Most likely, it was because they prepared an expensive Transfer Ore with a concealment function. Up until there, the plan was going smoothly. Later, I’ll have to seriously reevaluate the security system.</p>

<p>Anyways, it was after that point that irregularities began to occur. The Trap Spiders evolved into Trick Spiders after preying on one another, and Auguste, who turned back at the third floor, had no idea.</p>

<p>Well, we didn’t know either though. As a result, the intruders were wiped out when they transferred in.</p>

<p>However, they also brought in new Transfer Stones after going in, as to allow multiple intrusions.</p>

<p>Through doing so, several intruders were sent in… But no one returned. This was natural, given the fact that they were transferred right into a spider den.</p>

<p>As a result, a trick spider who had eaten the magic tools, such as the transfer stones possessed by those who were sent in, made an even further evolution. That’s my theory for why the Trickster Spider made its appearance in the dungeon.</p>

<p>If I knew that was going on inside the Dungeon, I wouldn’t have sent in low-ranked Adventurers. I’ll need to give them a generous bonus.</p>



<p>「I’ll be giving you a bonus for the danger you were subject to as well.」</p>

<p>「Please do.」</p>

<p>「That aside, your report, please.」</p>

<p>「Yes.」</p>



<p>The reason I had called for Frion was because of the request I had given to him personally.</p>



<p>「Then, according to you, how was she?」</p>



<p>He joined the dungeon investigation request to observe the rank D adventurer Fran, and to that I mean to ascertain who she is.</p>

<p>He is not only an Adventurer, but a member of the Guild’s staff as well. Rather than a Spy, he would be more like a hidden examiner.</p>



<p>「One moment please. ――Tarua.」</p>

<p>『Hmm. It’s been a while, Klimt.』</p>

<p>「You’re as splendid as ever.」</p>



<p>We Elves are a race that love Spirits, and among us there are people who are born possessed by a Spirit. It’d be about every 1 in 10 people, I suppose?</p>

<p>The Spirits that possess such Elves are known as Guardian Spirits, and are capable of receiving training. Furthermore, unlike Contracted Spirits, Guardian Spirits require significantly less magic power to summon; you could say they’re a buddy-like existence.</p>

<p>Many Guardian Spirits have affinities that the Elves are naturally gifted, so Nature, Soil, and Water spirits are numerous. Frion’s Spirit on the other hand is special.</p>

<p>It’s of the Soul attribute. Among Spirits, such an attribute is rare. I’ve made a contract with a single Soul Spirit, but its abilities don’t come close to Frion’s Tarua.</p>

<p>There were times when the Spirit perceived Fran as wicked, but half the time it was wrong. That was the capability of my Soul Spirit. Tarua on the other hand is much stronger, making it more suitable.</p>



<p>『Through my judgement, I could not see a wicked heart on the young girl called Fran. In fact, it has been a while since I saw someone with such little malice towards others.』</p>

<p>「For example, how she acted towards the Adventurer called Clad?」</p>

<p>『Fumu. That case was somewhat curious.』</p>

<p>「Curious how?」</p>

<p>『Umu. When the one known as Clad caused a commotion, the others reacted with anger and irritation… But that wasn’t the case for that girl. On the contrary, whenever Clad caused trouble, she found it rather interesting.』</p>



<p>Clad’s Roar of the Dragon was a promising young party. Their pace for growing was fast, considering they were able to reach Rank D within only a couple of years. Well, if you excluded Fran, that is.</p>

<p>Their problem, however, lied with their attitudes. They cause trouble, and they’ve made a lot of enemies as well. Even with that, however, I could promote them to Rank D without a problem.</p>

<p>Therefore, they were considered for this time’s request.</p>

<p>Using them, I could watch how Fran reacted towards people with bad character. At the same time, by having Clad interact with someone of a higher Status, I planned on having Clad become aware of his own hubris, but…</p>

<p>The effect was a bit more drastic than anticipated. Because they lacked sufficient strength, I intended to decline their promotion from the start, but when they were notified of such they accepted it with slightly-disappointed faces and a deep nod. I could understand why they reacted so after hearing about the Commission through Frion.</p>

        </div>
        

<p>Nowadays, the Adventurers are preaching of Fran’s splendor.</p>



<p>「Tarua, thank you very much.」</p>

<p>[Umu]</p>

<p>「Return・Tarua」</p>

<p>「Then, Frion. What kind of impression do you have of Fran?」</p>

<p>「Let me think… She’s an amazing child, I suppose?」</p>

<p>[Is it not the same?]</p>

<p>[Yes. But, it isn’t only her strength. How should I say it, I felt like her actions were considered beforehand. Shall I say that it is the conclusion I reached after I had a conversation with the person herself? Rather than concerning a plot, I think that she just thinks about things more deeply. To be that composed at that age, it’s to the extent that I want to learn from her.]</p>

<p>[Hohou. That will serve as a reference.]</p>

<p>[If you say so, it’s worthwhile to persist. But, why are you fixated on that girl to this extent?]</p>

<p>[Do I seem to be that fixated?]</p>

<p>[Yes. To the degree that rumours of you having a Lolita complex is spreading.]</p>

<p>[Silence!]</p>



<p>It was a waste to think he was courteous. Let me tell you, I don’t have a Lolita complex, you know?</p>

<p>The reason I was fixated with Fran in particular…….. One is because we lack information. As a guild master, I have to pay attention to troublemakers who are always in the center of turmoil. Despite this, there is surprisingly little information on her. Since she was approved by me as a guild member, this is like one of my duties.</p>

<p>It was never a Lolita complex. However, everyone has me as a Lolita complex, Lolita complex. Oops, my thought deviated a bit. Not good, Not good.</p>



<p>[Speaking of what I know, she has a magic sword, and is said to have appraisal.]</p>

<p>[I know of the magic sword, but appraisal?]</p>

<p>[Yes. It is certain.]</p>



<p>It was a magic stone that I handed over as an advance payment for this request, and I was convinced when I saw her selection. She chose a rank C magic stone of only two among the 20 stones, other than that, she also chose the magic stone that came from a demonic beast that inhabited the sea. It is too much to be a coincidence.</p>

<p>She not only possesses Appraisal, but also Appraisal Concealment. This is surprisingly advantageous in battle. That alone deserves precaution.</p>

<p>[Another thing, one of her weapon skills reached an advanced level. Judging from her combat style, it appears to be the art of a master swordsman. In addition, her magic is flame, storm, and darkness, and she learned lightning and healing afterward. Furthermore, her MGC is more than 100.]</p>

<p>A while ago, Fran changed jobs and returned. Her chosen occupation is a Magic Warrior which is the advance level of a Magic Swordsman. It’s status growth is better than a Magic Swordsman and it has the inherent skill [Magic Convergence]. The condition to choose this job is to have one or more of the sword, ax, or spear system combat arts to reach the advance level, in addition to using two systems of advance magic, it means that the MGC is more than 100.</p>

<p>And also, in the column of possible occupation choices, there seem to be Darkness Art User, Storm Art User, Lightning Art User, and Healing Art User.</p>

<p>In this short period, I wonder how much her skill will grow. She is in her first half of her teens. It is half-hearted to call her the term genius. There is possibility of her holding several blessings of god. Honestly, I can’t help but feel fear.</p>

<p>And then, the second reason that I’m fixated on her.</p>

<p>While her real nature is unclear, she is growing at a terrifying rate. It is impossible not to be alarmed.</p>



<p>[Well, I thought it even when she chose the magic stone, her naive side was unexpected.”]</p>



<p>Certainly, I didn’t think that she would really change occupations. If you go to the temple, you can change your occupation without leaking any information even if it is rather expensive. Isn’t she concerned that the information about her ability growth and skills would be leaked to us? Or, did she not think to this extent?</p>



<p>[Also, Amanda likes that one.]</p>



<p>If I indirectly bring up the subject of Fran, I thought that she would start talking about accompany Fran on this request……. I was surprised that I got even more than I plan to. Perhaps, she might have noticed my expectations. She was that concerned about Fran.</p>



<p>[Does Ms. Amanda have the ability to judge a person that much?]</p>

<p>[Rather than that, she could see through children. For example, though a child is seen, but if he or she is a long lived species who merely grows slowly, she normally comes into contact with them. Is her title usage the reason for that, I wonder?]</p>



<p>In other words, Fran is truly 12 years old. Until today, there was a small doubt of her being disguised as a long lived beastman.</p>



<p>[Honorable Uncle, I don’t understand. I wonder what kind of person she is?” (pengu: just a genius girl with a magic sword that has another world memories)</p>

<p>[I don’t understand either. No, it is probably who is she not?]</p>

<p>[What do you mean?]</p>

<p>[We were convinced that she was concealing something. But, is such a thing really true?”</p>



<p>Naturally, since she works as an adventurer at that age, I’m sure that she has some kind of circumstances. Just like many other adventurers. However, the kind of schemes and conspiracies we were anxious about didn’t exist. That is the final conclusion we came to from the gathered information.</p>

<p>She has diverse skills and a magic sword, a little belligerent and easily involved in trouble, accompanied by a unique darkness wolf, thought to have a special background, and is in someway a 12 year old girl.</p>

<p>It is neither more nor less than that. Could it be that the figure of Fran we saw is not everything? No, when I list it again, I am likely to fall into paranoia again. Not good, not good.</p>



<p>[Don’t depend on the judgement of the spirits too much, you might lose the eyes to judge people.]</p>



<p>It may be that Nell, who got along well with her in a blink of an eye, has a very discerning eye.</p>

        <h5>59 Night of Return</h5>

<p>「Then, kanpai！」</p>

<p>「Kanpai」</p>

<p>「Kanpai!」</p>

<p>The night after we finished the dungeon exploration.</p>

<p>Fran is at the bar. Amanda and Nell are also here. Having heard that Fran was leaving Alessa, they decided to throw a farewell party.</p>

<p>「Aah! Fran-chan is leaving me! Farewells are so sad!」</p>

<p>「Me too! Do you really have to go!?」</p>

<p>「Nn. Going to dungeon」</p>

<p>「Is the dungeon more important than me!」</p>

<p>「Right! It’s just a dungeon! Didn’t you only just meet Amanda, while we have been friends for nearly a month, right?」</p>

<p>「Mou! It’s not about length! I’ve been making friends with Fran-chan on a sleepover!」</p>

<p>They keep talking, about how Clad and The Roar of the Dragon failed the exam, how Donna was dumped by a woman, all the while drinking more and more.</p>

<p>The two gradually got drunk and the skinship increased. Urushi eventually retreated to Fran’s shadow after being stroked too much.</p>

<p>「I am also concerned about Fran-chan～」</p>

<p>「The orphanage?」</p>

<p>「Ara? Fran-chan knew? But it’ll be all right. There is no problem if I leave taking care of the children to the director, right?Isn’t it better if I go out and earn a lot of money for the orphanage? So, I’ll go Dungeon Diving with Fran!」</p>

<p>「Nn. I don’t mind」</p>

<p>「E? Really? Yahoo!」</p>

<p>「That’s no good!」</p>

<p>「Eeh? Why, Nell?」</p>

<p>「You, did you forget the contract?」</p>

<p>「Ah, that one. Ngh, I’ve signed a troublesome one!」</p>

<p>「You’re bad with the Guild Master’s sweet words, right」</p>

<p>「Uuuuh…」</p>

<p>「Contract?」</p>

<p>「That’s right! I can’t leave Alessa」</p>

<p>「Why?」</p>

<p>「Ehm, you see…」</p>

<p>「Hey, Amanda! There are too many people here!」</p>

<p>「Ah, right. ――Silence!」</p>

<p>Amanda set up a barrier to block sound. It’s a good magic for telling secrets, but maybe because she’s drunk her control was not too good.</p>

<p>Not just our own table was affected, but several of the surrounding tables got affected as well. Suddenly the sound disappeared and I could see a customer with a look of confusion on his face.</p>

<p>「Didn’t we enter a dungeon? That’s pretty important over there. After all, it’s a place where we can mass produce magic ore. It’s a place where it can be supplied steadier than with a mine, right?」</p>

<p>That is true. Looking at it from a military standpoint, it would be quite important. It may be natural to hide the existence using Oath Magic.</p>

<p>「But, the dungeon is under the jurisdiction of the guild, right? Even for a country it’s not something they can just obtain. But, the country wants the dungeon in Alessa no matter what!」</p>

<p>「Nn」</p>

<p>「And, Alessa is quite close to the border of the Raidos Kingdom, right?」</p>

<p>「Is that so?」</p>

<p>「Yes. Our relationship with Raidos is quite bad. That country is expanding pretty aggressively. At worst, there is the possibility of Alessa being targeted」</p>

<p>「It’s impossible to keep the magic ore a secret forever. Some day it’ll be known」</p>

<p>「And the country has been trying to obtain jurisdiction of the dungeon on the basis of this fact!」</p>

<p>「However, I do not want Alessa’s guild to lose this jurisdiction to the country! Because there is nothing else around Alessa than that dungeon, so if that dungeon is taken Alessas income with sharply decline, right?」</p>

<p>「And, our salaries would be cut too!!」</p>

<p>「So, the guild needs to guarantee that there is enough strength to protect Alessa even if we’re attacked by a neighboring country. By making Rank A adventurers be residents」</p>

<p>So for that reason Amanda cannot leave Alessa, huh?</p>

<p>「Because the country is eyeing us, the knight order here is kept weak. Commander Urs is a graduate of Alessa so he refused to leave though. The knights used to be a lot more serious in the past!」</p>

<p>It was not just because of bribes, but also for reasons such at Auguste becoming Vice-Commander, and perhaps there was also an element of harrasment.</p>

<p>「And so, that’s why I can’t leave this town～」</p>

<p>「I see」</p>

<p>「Even though I wanted to take care of Fran-chanー!」</p>

<p>「I said, it’s impossible!!」</p>

<p>「Well then, I’ll cherish today at least!」</p>

<p>「Yay. Truly Amanda!」</p>

<p>「Ara, not you, Nell. Only Fran-chan～」</p>

<p>「Stingyー!」</p>

<p>「Good stuff! Fran-chan～! Don’t forget me even though you’re leaving!!」</p>

<p>「Nn! Won’t forget」</p>

<p>Well, she was beaten up many times. Of course she won’t forget that.</p>

<p>「What!? Fran, you’re leaving Alessa!?」</p>

<p>「Wh-What did you say!?」</p>

<p>Somehow, it seems like the surrounding adventurers had been listening in. It seems the effects of Silence had ended without me noticing.</p>

<p>It’s a dwarf. Sitting there with a huge ale mug it certainly matches the atmosphere of a dwarf.</p>

<p>Who is he? I feel like I’ve seen him somewhere but…. Ah! He was one of the rank D adventurers who came after we had first fought the goblin army! I think his name was Hellbent.</p>

<p>「Hey, you serious!?」</p>

<p>「Shit, and we wanted to let her enter our party」</p>

<p>「What! We were going to invite her!」</p>

<p>「Fran-chaaan!!」</p>

<p>「Hey, don’t try to steal a march, guys!」</p>

<p>Heyhey, where did all these guys come from!? Somehow, it seems like everyone at the surrounding tables were adventurers. Besides that, even more adventurers have gathered!</p>

<p>「Fran-chan, I’m glad to have gotten to know you!」</p>

        </div>
        

<p>「Damn it! I haven’t repaid the favor yet, ya know～!」</p>

<p>Frion and Clad are there too. It seems they too have been drinking here.</p>

<p>「Where are you going?」</p>

<p>「Ulmut」</p>

<p>「Oh! A dungeon huh!」</p>

<p>「Nice! Some day we want to go too!」</p>

<p>「Wait a second! You should rank up first!」</p>

<p>「Yoosh! A cheers to the young lady’s prospects!」</p>

<p>「Uooohh!!」</p>

<p>「Cheers!!」</p>

<p>「Kanpai!!」</p>

<p>「Kampai!!」</p>

<p>「Bring more booze!」</p>

<p>「Bring a whole barrel!」</p>

<p>「Gahahahaha!!」</p>

<p>「Drink! Drink!」</p>

<p>「Another! Another!」</p>

<p>It’s a real Don Chan fuss. They even want Fran to drink!</p>

<p>「Are ye drinking, Fran-chan?」</p>

<p>「Nn」</p>

<p>「This’s not juice! It’s something better～」</p>

<p>「Hey, Amanda! What the hell are you making her drink!」</p>

<p>「It’s… It’s just wheat juice!」</p>

<p>「I’ll drink」</p>

<p>「No!」</p>

<p>「Eee～! Stingy! Just a bit!」</p>

<p>「Stingy」</p>

<p>「No means NO! I’ll be taking that!」</p>

<p>「Ooooh! Nell is downing it fast!」</p>

<p>「That’s hot!」</p>

<p>「This is fun, Fran-chan～!」</p>

<p>「Nn」</p>

<p>Well, Fran looks like she’s having fun so I guess it’s OK.</p>

<p>In the end everyone drank until they collapsed. Fran and I ended up coming home in the middle of the night. It seems Urushi was sleeping in Fran’s shadown most of the time.</p>

<p>『Are you OK?』</p>

<p>「Nn」</p>

<p>While I couldn’t drink myself I did enjoy the atmosphere. Maybe I got a little drunk from that alone. It seems poison resistance does not fully negate alcohol.</p>

<p>「I’m OK」</p>

<p>『Is that so?』</p>

<p>「Nn」</p>

<p>『Are you hungry now?』</p>

<p>If she’s hungry I’ll just pull something out.</p>

<p>「Bit hungry. Curry?」</p>

<p>『This time it’s not curry. Just a moment! Yosh, the date has changed!』</p>

<p>This inn has clocks in all the rooms. In fact, it seems it’s a fairly cheap magic tool so it’s common.</p>

<p>Most places has a clock on the wall to show the time. However, I have never seen a wristwatch so maybe it’s hard to downsize it.</p>

<p>And, there are calendars. Each month is 30 days but there is a special day every three months. It’s written as a Party Day. It seems like the four seasons are officially separated by this day.</p>

<p>So, one year ends up with 364 days. By the way, today is March 18.</p>

<p>『Well then, try this』</p>

<p>「? What’s this? Smells sweet…」</p>

<p>『It’s a pancake. Actually, I wanted to make a decorated cake but I was lacking in materials and time. So, I settled for this』</p>

<p>「Why? Any celebration?」</p>

<p>『Yupp! Today it had been one month since we first met. How could I not make something?』</p>

<p>It was actually quite hard. I had to be creative to not be noticed. Doppelganger is still lvl 1 so it can only be used 5 minutes a day.</p>

<p>Even if you greatly lower the status of your alter ego and kept pouring magical power excessively with the Sorcery skill, the maximum limit of activity was 15 minutes.</p>

<p>I could only send my Doppel out secretly while Fran was sleeping. But since we had already gotten permission to use the kitchen outside of working hours it’d have been a waste not to use it, right?</p>

<p>I secretly snuck in the material during our shopping and then advanced the preparations for 15 minutes every night; making cream from the milk, cutting fruit for decorations, it was hard work.</p>

<p>I finished the first prototype a few days before we went to the dungeon. I studied how to bake with only 15 minutes to work with every night; it was a fierce challenge!</p>

<p>In addition to that, because my Doppel was so weak the level of Cooking actually sunk to 1!! It was a real challenge to make decent dishes like that!</p>

<p>I tasted it once but due to the quality of my Doppel its sense of taste was really dull. In addition, it seems to use magical power to digest things</p>

<p>eaten in reverse, it is a vicious cycle that the activation limit becomes shorter as you taste it!</p>

<p>Also, when people saw me during the work I could not explain what I was doing, also due to the quality of my Doppel.</p>

<p>Well, because things didn’t work out I ended up cooking while carrying my main body. The more you’re used to a skill, the more you tend to rely on the sensation of it.    //Maaka: Like Small-Fry Vice Commander did</p>

<p>「This cake, for me?」</p>

<p>『Ou!』</p>

<p>It looks like Fran hadn’t noticed anything, Surprise Successful!!</p>

<p>『Please go ahead!』</p>

<p>「Nn. I’ll eat」</p>

<p>On top of the two-tiered pancake, I had put plenty of fresh cream, syrup and fruit. Fran cut the pancake with a fork and started eating.</p>

<p>“Mogyu Mogyu…”</p>

<p>『How is it?』</p>

<p>「Tasty. Super Tasty」</p>

<p>“Mogyu Mogyu Mogyu Mogyu…”</p>

<p>Good! it seems like she liked it. Fran is eating energetically in silence.</p>

<p>『Hey, your mouth is all sticky』</p>

<p>「Nn」</p>

<p>『Yosh, that’s better』</p>

<p>「Thanks」</p>

<p>“Mogyu Mogyu…”</p>

<p>『Oi, you got sticky again!』</p>

<p>「Because the cake is good」</p>

<p>『Yes yes～』</p>

<p>Fran goes silent again. She wouldn’t say another word and just kept eating the pancake.</p>

<p>「Thanks for the food」</p>

<p>『It was nothing』</p>

<p>「Ne, Teacher?」</p>

<p>『Hmm?』</p>

<p>「Thank you」</p>

<p>『Ou!』</p>

<p>That smile is more than enough of a reward.</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h1>60 – Verification</h1>

<p>「Oh, have you come today too? Magic-Sword Girl」(Shuuren)</p>

<p>「Nn」(Fran)</p>

<p>Stop it with that name, Shuuren-jisan!</p>

<p>We were in the Guild’s library to learn more about some things Amanda taught us during the dungeon visit.</p>

<p>Fran has no problem focusing on most things but when studying her concentration doesn’t last long.</p>

<p>So, we’re checking carefully while keeping it quick.</p>

<p>The last few days have consisted of sparring with Amanda in the mornings, taking a nap after lunch and then studying in the afternoon. It has been rather relaxing.</p>

<p>「Today I want to study magic」(Fran)</p>

<p>「Even if you say that, there are many different kinds」(Shuuren)</p>

<p>「Then, compound magic」(Fran)</p>

<p>「Hou. Then, on the shelf there, on the third row from the bottom, on the right end there are beginners books about composite magic」(Shuuren)</p>

<p>As always, he has an amazing memory.</p>

<p>The books recommended by Shuuren-jisan contains a brief introduction to various compound magics which is easy to understand.</p>

<p>I read while asking Fran to turn the pages for me. Fran does so with a bored expression. After that, I studied various other spells but as for rare attributes there wasn’t very much written.</p>

<p>And so, let’s summarize what I’ve learned is these past few days;</p>

<p>– Wood Magic: Composite of Water and Earth. As its name suggests, it can control plants. It can not only grow plants, but also make them die. There also seems to be a spell for not getting lost at sea.</p>

<p>– Ice Magic: Composite of Water and Air. It can manipulate cold air. It can attack with ice and snow, and it can also freeze objects by removing heat in the area. There are also spells for Cold Resistance.</p>

<p>– Life Magic: Composite of Water and Fire. It is Magic which manipulates life itself. It does have recovery spells but that’s not its true value. It’s able to nurture life, and can even create artificial lifeforms (homunculi) when combined with alchemy!</p>

<p>– Lightning Magic: Composite of Wind and Fire. It can not only control electrical forces but also magnetic fields. Apart from attacking it can also be used to enhance the body’s nervous system, increasing reaction speed.</p>

<p>– Sand Magic: Composite of Wind and Earth. Apart from manipulating sand, it can also be used for drying, dehydration, weathering, etc. It seems like it can be used for processing food this way.</p>

<p>– Lava Magic: Composite of Earth and Fire. It manipulates metals, ores, lava, etc. It’s an attribute with a strong connection to the deep earth. It seems to have spells useful for blacksmithing.</p>

<p>That’s how compound magic works. There are also the special attributes.</p>

<p>– Spatial-Temporary Magic: It’s Magic that can manipulate time and space. Metastasis, time manipulation, and summoning are confirmed to be of this attribute.</p>

<p>– Moonlight Magic: Deals with reflection and mental manipulation, even physical manipulation. In my opinion, it really reminded me of vampires and werewolves.</p>

<p>– Auxiliary Magic : Attributes specialized for assisting status ups, barriers, etc. There is a technique that is similar to other attributes, but effects like auxiliary attributes can not be obtained it seems.</p>

<p>Another thing I was interested in was old man Gallus’s skills, so I checked out his other skills in detail.</p>

<p>– Blacksmith: A system gathering magic that is necessary for smithing. It is something created by the God of Blacksmithing. It includes various spells dealing with fire, wind, molten iron, and so on, but it seems that it can only be used for smithing because its power is drastically reduced when its used in battle.</p>

<p>– Magic Blacksmith: Allows the creating of magic equipment by putting mana into things created with Blacksmithing. It provides magic control far beyond common blacksmiths, allowing the user to give the desired effects and attributes.</p>

<p>Even though their names are similar they are completely different.</p>

<p>There are many other things I would like to look into, but we decided to leave the library room. I lost to the sound of Fran’s stomach grumbling so we went to eat lunch.</p>

<p>Oh well, it can’t be helped. If we eat lunch we can go and verify some skills later. Fran is tired of the study room anyways.</p>

<p>After we left the town we had Urushi confirm that there are no people nearby. Now, let’s verify the skills!</p>

<p>First, let’s confirm the skills I got from the spiders. Unfortunately I was not able to absorb the Trickster Spider’s magic stone, and we had to be careful with absorbing other stones too since we were not alone, but I managed to absorb 10 magic stones from Trap and Trick spiders.</p>

<p>Confusion Poison Generation: Lv 1</p>

<p>Infrared Vision: Lv 1</p>

<p>Poison Jet: Lv 1</p>

<p>Paralytic Poison Generation: Lv 1</p>

<p>Strong Poison Production: Lv 1</p>

<p>Poison Generation skills gave you the ability to create poison in your body. It can give poison attributes to your blood and body fluids. This poison has no effect on the creator so Fran is unaffected when using it.</p>

<p>Infrared vision is, well, as its name suggests.</p>

<p>Poison Jet is the ability to spray poison. It’s a meaningless skill if you don’t have a poison generation skill, but regardless of that I can already inject Demonic Poison. It seems like our repertoire is getting quite dirty…</p>

<p>I also want to check the Attribute Sword.</p>

<p>『First is the Flame Attribute』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「Nn」(Fran)</p>

<p>I also used it against the spider web, but it’s quite powerful.</p>

<p>『Is it hot?』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「It’s alright」(Fran)</p>

<p>「Ou」(Fran)</p>

<p>Fran answers with a calm face while swinging my red-hot flaming body. It doesn’t seem like she’s enduring so it should be fine.</p>

<p>However, Urushi looks like he finds it too hot. It seems like the user is less affected by the heat.</p>

<p>There might be a problem when using the Overboost of the Sorcery skill though. Let’s try it carefully with a little power.</p>

<p>『How is it?』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「Hot」(Fran)</p>

<p>「Kyaun」(Fran)</p>

<p>Un, it seems like it’s impossible to swing me in this state. It seems like it can only be used with the Telekinetic Catapult. Too bad.</p>

<p>『Well, shall we try the other attributes as well? We’ll try all basic attributes first』(Teacher)</p>

<p>Earth and Water attributes are subtle. Of course the attack power increases, but both seem to simply increase the impact power. It seems like it’d be useful with blunt weapons.</p>

<p>However, the effect of Wind attribute is good. It increases my sharpness tremendously. Although the effect doesn’t affect as large an area as the Fire attribute, if it’s pure attack power the Wind Attribute wins hands down.</p>

<p>『How about the Dark Attribute? Is it possible to use Attribute Sword with it in the first place?』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「Try?」(Fran)</p>

<p>Oh! It’s a sword of darkness! Cool――!! However, I don’t understand the effect well. It definitely increases the sharpness.</p>

<p>『Urushi, do you understand?』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「Oon」(Urushi)</p>

<p>Urushi understands Dark magic better than me. I thought he might have a hint.</p>

<p>『Ah! Urushi!』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「Gyan!」(Urushi)</p>

<p>Urushi who was sniffing the blade let out a scream. Hey, what are you doing?</p>

<p>If you check the status, his MP is decreasing. It seems like it has a Mana Burn effect. Moreover, it just requires physical contact.</p>

<p>「Kuu」(Urushi)</p>

<p>「Alright?」(Fran)</p>

<p>「Uun…」(Urushi)</p>

<p>I learned the effect through Urushi’s sacrifice. Yosh, let’s continue to the next one.</p>

<p>「Next, Lightning」(Fran)</p>

<p>『Yosh, Let’s do it!』(Teacher)</p>

<p>My blade is crackling with electricity. Fran tried the cutting ability.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>It’s pretty useful. If we keep it weak it acts as a stun gun. If we make it strong it will fry the opponent from the inside. Moreover, it’s difficult to defend against since weapons and armor would just conduct the electricity. It should be quite effective in battle.</p>

<p>「Lightning sword. Cool」(Fran)</p>

<p>『Does Fran like this?』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「Nn. Biri-biri, amazing」(Fran)</p>

<p>「Oon!」(Urushi)</p>

<p>Fran is swinging around my crackling body. Next to her, Urushi’s fur is standing straight, he looks like a hedgehog. Looks kinda gross. It seems both are having fun though.</p>

<p>Next up are the special attributes. First we tried Recovery and Auxiliary, but the Attribute Sword wouldn’t even activate. It seems only the basic, compound and light/dark attributes could be used with Attribute Sword.</p>

<p>『Next is Fran’s new inherent skill』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「Nn. Magical Convergence」(Fran)</p>

<p>It is a skill she got when changing her class to Magic Warrior, so I don’t have access to it. Therefore I can’t give her advice on it. First, let’s have Fran use it.</p>

<p>Magical Convergence: Increase the power of magic and fighting techniques by manipulating and converging magical power instead of increasing the amount of magical power used.</p>

<p>According to the description I got through the Sorcery Skill it seems to be a skill which breaks the user’s limits.  </p>

<p>『Be careful』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「Nn」(Fran)</p>

<p>First Fran cast an ordinary Fire Arrow. Five ordinary fire arrows appear. I’m very familiar with this spell so it’s just right for comparison.</p>

<p>And then, the Magical Convergence version.</p>

<p>「――Fire・Arrow」(Fran)</p>

<p>Bobow!!</p>

<p>『Whoa! Ain’t that amazing』(Teacher)</p>

<p>The arrows are twice their normal size and there’s almost twice as many as well. It seems the power of each one is quite high.</p>

<p>『Can you do it more precisely?』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「Will try」(Fran)</p>

<p>After experimenting we found out that the Magical Convergence can be used quite liberally. Its effect is consumed by a single spell but increases its power several time over. It seems to be useable about 20 times.</p>

<p>It seems the magical power consumption when using Magical Convergence does increase to about three times normal. Well, as long as I’m here we won’t have to worry about that though.</p>

<p>More importantly, it’s better than being unreasonable by using my special skill. Since I couldn’t control the Sorcery skill even if I forced it. It’s power is simply too high so it would hurt Fran.</p>

<p>Fran’s Magical Convergence may not have the output of the Sorcery skill, but it can be controlled perfectly. It truly is worthy as a unique skill of a high-ranked job.</p>

<p>Well then, we still have some skills to verify left.</p>

<p>「What next?」(Fran)</p>

<p>『That’s right. Well then, how about trying that?』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「That?」(Fran)</p>

<p>「Oun?」(Urushi)</p>

<p>『Skill Superiorization』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「Oo」(Urushi)</p>

<p>For the sake of today’s request, we have secured some magic stones from Goblins. Of course, they have Sword Arts.</p>

<p>『I’ve been thinking about how we should use the Self-Evolution points. I think we should do some experiments with Superiorization』(Teacher)</p>

<p>I’d like to know if Superiorization is useful. If it’s not worth the points we’ll ignore it in the future.</p>

<p>「Nn, agree」(Fran)</p>

<p>『Then, let’s do it?』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「Nn」(Fran)</p>

<p>My remaining Self-Evolution points are 41. We’ll use 10 to superiorize Sword Arts.</p>

<p>〈 Sword Arts: LvMax will be superiorized 〉</p>

<p>A few seconds after the announcement ended I start shining brightly. Something amazing is coming!</p>

<p>〈 Superiorization is completed. Sword Arts: LvMax has changed to Sword Arts: SP 〉</p>

<p>The name is quite subtle; it just changed the notation to SP. Well then, what kind of skill is it?</p>

<p>Sword Arts: SP – Special skill: The Sword Arts skill growth rate of equipment registrants greatly increased. All status of equipment registrant +2. The effect of Sword Arts skill rises.</p>

<p>It was expected that the effect of the Sword Arts skill would rise. However, the status and growth rate increase is a terrific ability. Rather than empowering me, the superiorization improves the growth and strength of my equipment registrants!</p>

<p>Since the growth rate of Sword Arts greatly increases it means that Fran will be able to one day stand at the peak of swordsmanship even without me.</p>

<p>『Fran, how’s the feeling when swinging me?』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「Same as usual」(Fran)</p>

<p>『How about Sword Techniques?』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「Nn. Dragon・Fang」(Fran)</p>

<p>It looks like it’s working properly. No problems with Sword Techniques either huh. With Fran activating a Sword Technique from a higher level than her Master Sword Arts level it means it properly counts as a higher level than the Sword Techniques. Well, it seems like I won’t need to take over and raise her Sword Arts intentionally.</p>

<p>Superiorization. Not bad. However, it’s hard to tell whether it’s always better to do it. It’s a matter of priority. Well, the Sword Arts I tried this time is a weapon skill, I do not know how magical skills will change. I would like to try it for a bit.</p>

<p>「Teacher, want to superiorize other skills too?」(Fran)</p>

<p>『Well. No, let’s stop for now. Rather than that, I have something I’d like to talk with you about』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「Consultation?」(Fran)</p>

<p>『Ah. After we went to dungeon, I have reflected on things』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「Nn. Me too」(Fran)</p>

<p>『Until now, we’ve equally increased all useful skills; magic, weapon and other combat related ones right? But, I thought about whether to raise a different kind of skill』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「I see」(Fran)</p>

<p>Unlike the wide outdoors, escape routes are quite limited in a dungeon. I’ve come to realize that to survive there you need more than just combat ability.</p>

<p>This is the candidates I’ve thought about for that.</p>

<p>Chant Shortening: Lv 1</p>

<p>Crisis Detection: Lv 1</p>

<p>Sign Perception: Lv 2</p>

<p>Instant Regeneration: Lv 1</p>

<p>Abnormal Status Resistance: Lv 3</p>

<p>Magical Barriers: Lv 1</p>

<p>Trap Sensing: Lv 1</p>

<p>With Crisis Detection, Sign Perception and Trap Sensing we can try to avoid traps and dangerous enemies in advance.</p>

<p>Chant Shortening will widen our range of viable tactics.</p>

<p>Instant Regeneration, Abnormal Status Resistance and Magical Barriers will allow us to survive in a pinch.</p>

<p>I have 31 Self-Evolution points left. I could max out one of the skills or distribute it to three different skills for diversity.</p>

<p>As for me, I’d like to increase the detection skills for a bit, especially the Trap Sensing. When you think about dungeons, it’s traps right?</p>

<p>『What do you want to do, Fran?』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「Unnn～」(Fran)</p>

<p>After talking with Fran, we decided to raise the Sign Perception, Trap Sensing, Chant Shortening and Abnormal Status Resistance to Lv5.</p>

<p>Since we’re not diving into a dungeon right at the moment, I felt we should probably save some points but… I decided to raise the levels right now. Are we a bit too loose with points?</p>

<p>If you can get the skills you want, don’t you want to use them right away? So we decided to allocate the necessary skills right now.</p>

<p>With this we’ll be much safer when exploring the dungeon. I only have 5 Self-Evolution points left though.</p>

<p>『With this we should be safe even in a dungeon』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「Nn」(Fran)</p>

<p>「On」(Urushi)</p>

<p>『But, you won’t regret it?』(Teacher)</p>

<p>「Nope」(Fran)</p>

<p>「Owan!」(Urushi)</p>

        <h1>61 – Getting New Equipment</h1>



<p>「Equipment, ready?」</p>

<p>「Ou! It’s perfect!」</p>



<p>Four days after the farewell party we were at old man Gallus’s workshop.</p>

<p>We have been in this town for one month now. Today is the promised day.</p>



<p>『Has it gone well?』</p>

<p>「Gahahaha! It’s the best! It’s been the most enjoyable time of my life!」</p>

<p>『Isn’t that exagerating it?』</p>



<p>We gave him C and D ranked monster materials. It’s certainly not weak but a blacksmith of Gallus’s level would definitely have worked with more advanced materials.</p>



<p>『Haven’t you created stronger equipment before?』</p>

<p>「Nono, I didn’t mean it is my best work ever」</p>

<p>「?」</p>

<p>「How to say it, it’s like I put my soul into it. That’s important! Well, I always but my soul into it. However, there are moments when I can do a particularly satisfying job」</p>



<p>Nope, I can’t really understand what you mean…</p>



<p>「This was one of those times. My skill, creativity, soul, and more. There are times when they come together amazingly well」</p>

<p>『Well, what can we expect then?』</p>

<p>「Ou! This is armor blessed by God!」</p>

<p>「God?」</p>



<p>Gallus went to the back of the store and brought back a huge bag. He then put the contents on the counter with a confident expression.</p>



<p>「Take a look, this is the young lady’s new armor!」</p>



<p>Name: Black Cat’s Armor</p>

<p>Defense : 100</p>

<p>Endurance : 600/600</p>

<p>Effect: Pleasant Sleep, Deodorant, Purification, Mental Stability Boost</p>

<p>Name: Black Cat’s Heavenly Earring</p>

<p>Defense : 15</p>

<p>Endurance : 300/300</p>

<p>Endurance : 600/600</p>

<p>Defense : 15</p>

<p>Endurance : 300/300</p>

<p>Effect: Magic Resistance ↑ Low, Abnormal Status Resistance ↑ Low, Item Box (small)</p>



<p>Yes, that is horrifyingly powerful. It’s far stronger than our current equipment, which we paid 150 000 for. It’s even superior to the expensive equipment we took from Gyuran.</p>

<p>By the way, the equipment we took from Gyuran is like this:</p>



<p>Name: Leather Armor of the Fire-fighting Lion</p>

<p>Defense : 90</p>

<p>Endurance : 500/500</p>

<p>Effect: Fire Resistance ↑ High, Poison Resistance ↑ Low</p>



<p>Name: Shoulderpads of the False Dragon</p>

<p>Defense : 61</p>

<p>Endurance : 400/400</p>

<p>Effect: Impact Resistance Boost, Arm Strength ↑ Low</p>



<p>Name: Hundred Eyes Shoes</p>

<p>Defense : 45</p>

<p>Endurance : 330/330</p>

<p>Name: Anti-poison Bracelet</p>

<p>Defense : 5</p>

<p>Endurance : 100/100</p>

<p>Effect: Poison Resistance ↑ Mid</p>



<p>The equipment made by old man Gallus has both excellent defensive power as well as effects. Moreover, it’s also lighter than our current equipment? But, what does he mean with them being blessed by God?</p>



<p>「This is my masterpiece, the Black Cat series!」</p>

<p>「Good name」</p>

<p>『But, it sounds too cute for an old man』</p>

<p>「Onn」    </p>

<p>「Leave me alone! Well, it wasn’t I who named it as such」</p>

<p>「then, who named it?」</p>

<p>「It was God」</p>

<p>「?」</p>

<p>「Owan?」</p>

<p>『What do you mean?』</p>

<p>「What, you didn’t know? This is a “Named Item”」</p>



<p>It seems Named Items are special items given a name by a God. For example, if the God of Blacksmithing recognizes something made by a blacksmith then a name will be given to it by the God.</p>

<p>It seems legendary equipment found in labyrinths often are Named Items.</p>

<p>Divine protection will be granted only to the best created items, increasing their performance further.</p>



<p>「It is the highest honor a blacksmith can receive to have an item created by them be recognized by God. I thank you for giving me that opportunity. My acquaintance who helped with the production also cried from joy. Thank you!」</p>

<p>『No no, we’re the ones who should thank you for such amazing equipment』</p>

<p>「Gahahahaha! With the divine protection that equipment can compete with equipment created from Rank B monsters!」</p>

<p>『That’s amazing!』</p>

<p>「Moreover, the protection is amazing!」</p>

<p>『Eh? You mean it’s not the resistances that’s the protection?』</p>

<p>「Well, you’ll get it somehow when you equip it」</p>

<p>「Got it」</p>



<p>We borrow a room in the back where Fran can put on the Black Cat series. The equipment has a sense of unity with white fringing on a black background, which kind of resembles Fran.</p>

<p>The equipment has both a boyish atmosphere and cuteness living together. Clothes with a hole for the tail. A pleasing outerwear with a collared big shirt in bisuche style. The jeweled clasp at the chest also adds femininity. It shows off her navel but I’ll forgive it since it’s cute.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>Open-fingered gloves and boot-like shoes which covers her calves. The leather belt has a cowboy-like shape and can conceal a dagger. It even has a small Item Box which can hold about five potions. The platinum-colored earring doesn’t have much of a presence but it looks cute when Fran wears it.</p>

<p>The mantle reminds me more of a raincoat rather than a mantle. Still, it’s light and supple, and it doesn’t disturb movement.</p>



<p>「Mostly non-metallic materials have been used. It was a real struggle to make leather this strong. The composite materials used to make the equipment was created through immersing the Tyrant Saber’s skin, the Doppel Snake’s scales and the Blast Tortoise’s shell in the Slime Lord which had been mixed with various reagents」</p>

<p>『Just hearing that is amazing』</p>

<p>「It was a series of failures before I was satisfied. Because it’s made with a special material it’s far stronger than common metal armor. Above all, it’s light」</p>



<p>Lightness is important. Fran uses speed and agility as her main attributes, so this is perfect equipment for her. When I checked again, I noticed something.</p>



<p>『Black Cat’s Protection?』</p>

<p>「You noticed? It’s the effect of God’s blessing. Black Cat’s Protection is given while wearing the whole Black Cat Set. The effect is all status +10. In addition, it negates instant death effects. In exchange, it can only be used by the Black cat Tribe」</p>



<p>To get such protection from equipment, isn’t that fantastic? All status +10 alone is a amazing. While it might not be quite as hard as heavy plate armor, considering its lightness it is definitely far better than that. It has a huge amount of effects and is as hard as metal fitted armor.</p>



<p>「Very cool」</p>

<p>『Moreover, it’s cute. Overpowered!』</p>

<p>「Right? It’s the strongest equipment right. Gahaha!」</p>

<p>『Is it really all right for us to get this for free?』</p>

<p>「Yeah, that was the promise. Since I got all the extra material I still made a profit you know. Also, just being able to create that has been amazing, so I wouldn’t accept money even if you wanted. However――」</p>

<p>「However?」</p>

<p>「There is one thing I must tell you. This is equipment of the highest quality. However, due to that, it requires a rather powerful demonic magic stone to repair damage to it. Which would be quite expensive…」</p>

<p>『About how much would it cost?』</p>

<p>「About 100 000 the first time, then it’ll probably double each time」</p>

<p>『Geh! That’s pretty bad』</p>

<p>「Yes. However, the mantle has Equipment Self-Repair. That actually affects everything equiped so if you are not in a hurry you can just wait a few days for it to be restored」</p>



<p>That’s a relief. Then, maybe we won’t have to get it repaired ever. Phew, I rushed to conclusions.</p>



<p>『Then, next would be equipment for Urushi』</p>

<p>「Is that your dog?」</p>

<p>『Aa, it seems that we have gotten a familiar. Is there any armor that can be equiped by a wolf?』</p>



<p>There are other problems as well. Urushi changes in size often. We can’t afford it breaking everything he does. If it fits when he’s small, it’ll probably strangle him when he grows big.</p>

<p>When I told Gallus about it he said it won’t be a problem.</p>



<p>「There are many armors with automatic size adjustment functions. If you just get one with that it will be fine」</p>

<p>「Really?」</p>

<p>「On?」</p>

<p>「Ou! Leave it to me. I can make it in two days」</p>

<p>『In that case we’ll rely on you』</p>

<p>「Ooon!」</p>

<p>『Then, how much would it be?』</p>

<p>「Let’s see… If I get 50 000 I could make something quite good」</p>

<p>「Good, please do」</p>



<p>After that, Urushi ended up licking and hitting old man Gallus with his wagging tail as he tried to take measurements, and other such things happened.</p>

<p>Since old man Gallus is quite tough it was fine, but a normal blacksmith would have had his life endangered. Or rather, isn’t this old man amazing? To take no damage from all that…</p>

<p>I guess I’ll have to seriously train Urushi to behave or we’ll have a serious incident some day.</p>



<p>「Where are you guys going next?」</p>

<p>「Ulmut」</p>

<p>「Hou. I’ve already done what I wanted to do in this town. Maybe I should head to Ulmut next?」</p>

<p>『Oh? Well, should we head there together then?』</p>



<p>If it’s old man Gallus he’s most welcome to join us.</p>



<p>「By the way, what route will you be taking?」</p>

<p>『From here we’ll head south to Darth and take a ship to Barbola. From there we’ll head to Ulmut on land. It’s more expensive than only heading by land, but it’s also faster. More importantly, I want Fran to get to experience a journey by boat』</p>

<p>「Go together?」</p>

<p>「…I’m sorry, young lady. I don’t think I can go with you」</p>

<p>「?」</p>

<p>『Why?』</p>

<p>「…Dwarves are mountain folk」</p>

<p>「Nn」</p>

<p>「In other words, we’re not good with deep water. I can’t swim!」</p>



<p>I see, because he’s a dwarf. Certainly, when I look at Gallus he’s built like a boulder. He definitely doesn’t seem like he’d float.</p>



<p>「I see. Too bad」</p>

<p>「Kuu」</p>

<p>「I’m Sorry」</p>

<p>『Well then, I hope to meet you again in Ulmot』</p>

<p>「Ou!」</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h5>62 New Wings</h5>



<p>Three days after receiving the new equipment.</p>



<p>「See you～」</p>

<p>「I’ll be waiting!」</p>

<p>「Let’s meet in Ulmut!」</p>

<p>「We’ll be waiting for you!」</p>

<p>「See you～」</p>



<p>We were seen off from Alessa by Amanda, Donna, Gallus, Randall and Delt.</p>



<p>『It was a good town』</p>



<p>I do not know about any other towns in this world, but I’m glad this was the first place we visited.</p>



<p>「Nn」</p>

<p>『Well then, lets head west from here on. To the port town Darth』</p>



<p>We’ll get on a ship in Darth and head south from there to Barbola. After that we’ll travel by foot to Ulmut.</p>

<p>Since we sold all the materials we had we have plenty of money. So, my current goal is to take a good ship. Preferably a real passenger ship rather than a transport ship.</p>

<p>If it turns out to be too expensive I’m planning on earning a little in Darth. We bought quite a bit of potions but we still have one million Gorudo. It’ll work out somehow.</p>



<p>『Well then, I’m counting on you, Urushi!』</p>

<p>「On!」</p>



<p>Urushi lowered himself and Fran jumped up on him.</p>



<p>『You’ve got a good grip?』</p>

<p>「Nn」</p>



<p>Fran is holding on to Urushi’s collar firmly. The collar made by Gallus has a string specifically for making it easy to grab hold of. If she holds on it that, Fran will not be thrown off easily. Nice job, old man Gallus!</p>

<p>Urushi’s forelegs are equiped with black and gold anklets. They slightly increase the strength and speed of the wearer and they also has a size adjustment effect so Urushi can wear them no matter what size he takes. These were also made by Gallus.</p>

<p>He’s amazing to make these in just two days. As expected of a master blacksmith.</p>



<p>「Urushi, Go!」</p>

<p>「Ooooooh!」</p>



<p>Urushi barks with great spirit and runs west.</p>

<p>Fast Fast!! Alessa is quickly disappearing behind us!</p>



<p>『Keep it up, Urushi!』</p>

<p>「Onon!」</p>



<p>Urushi speeds up even more with my encouragement. His tail is swinging with excitement. But, it seems Fran doesn’t share the excitement.</p>



<p>「Eyes, hurts」</p>



<p>It seems Urushi is too fast. Fran can’t keep her eyes open due to the wind shear, so I use wind magic to reduce the pressure.</p>



<p>『How’s this?』</p>

<p>「Nn, feels comfortable」</p>



<p>Good. It seems Fran can enjoy the scenery confortably now by just narrowing her eyes a little.</p>



<p>「What’s that?」</p>

<p>「Birds」</p>

<p>「That mountain, the top is white」</p>



<p>Fran is enjoying the ride. The scenery is flying past us. Also, Urushi never slows down at all. Even if there are obstacles he just flies over them with a jump and continues in a straight line.</p>



<p>『Oh, is that a magical beast?』</p>

<p>「Where?」</p>

<p>『Look, behind that tree』</p>

<p>「Let’s go」</p>

<p>『Ooon』</p>



<p>Occasionally we spot magical beasts, and hunt them down. There doesn’t seem to be any strong magical beasts around here, they all die from a single attack by Urushi. I absorb the magic stone, store the meat, and let Urushi eat the bones and organs. Un, it’s best not to waste anything.</p>

<p>However, this high speed didn’t last. No matter how much of a magical beast Urushi is, he’ll get tired if he keeps running. He’ll also get hungry.</p>

<p>Sometimes he also uses Sky Step so his MP has also decreased a lot.</p>



<p>『It can’t be helped. Let’s go by foot for a little while』</p>

<p>「Good job」</p>

<p>『What’ll we do with urushi?』</p>

<p>「On!」</p>



<p>Urushi barks lightly and then slips into Fran’s shadow. Urushi has two skills for entering shadows; Shadow Dive and Shadow Migration. Shadow Dive can only enter a shadow, while Shadow Migration allows him to move from shadow to shadow.</p>

<p>Unlike Shadow Migration which consumes a lot of MP, Shadow Dive seems to consume almost no MP at all. Also, it seems to only consume MP when entering the shadow and nothing while remaining inside of it. Therefore, it seems like Urushi can rest and recover while inside a shadow as such.</p>

<p>If he’s in Fran’s shadow he’ll also of course move along with Fran so it’s a useful skill.</p>



<p>『Well, shall we continue leisurely?』</p>

<p>「Nn」</p>



<p>We keep on going while having lunch at the same time.</p>

<p>Around here the surroundings change. The forest surrounding Alessa ends and turns into plains. However, it’s not a savannah like wilderness, but a green grassy plain.</p>

<p>Considering the change compared to around Alessa you understand it’s actually quite far. It makes you understand just how fast Urushi was.</p>

<p>It’s only been half a day since we left Alessa. When I casually looked up into the sky my mind shouted out in surprise.</p>



<p>『Uoooh! That, that! What is THAT!?』</p>

</iframe>


        </div>
        

<p>「Nn?」</p>

<p>『Look, over there! Up there!』</p>

<p>「Which one?」</p>

<p>「On?」</p>

<p>『There, next to the clouds! The one floating in the sky!』</p>

<p>「That floating island?」</p>

<p>『Floating island? What’s that? FANTASY!!』</p>



<p>You know, it’s a flying island! A Flying Island!! Ghibli fans will drool. Well, even if you’re not that, no fantasy lover can resist that.</p>

<p>Just above us, an island is floating in the sky. I get excited just watching it!</p>

<p>how is it floating? Is it that? Flight Stones? Or is it wind magic? An even more fantasy-ish power? Nice～, I want to go～!</p>



<p>『Ne, nee, is that not something rare?』</p>



<p>Fran doesn’t seem very surprised. Maybe it’s a common sight in this world.</p>



<p>「Nn. Sometimes they float」</p>

<p>『Seriously!?』</p>



<p>How terrible! It’s already been two months since I reincarnated into this world, yet I still didn’t know of such a wonderful spot!</p>

<p>No, wait a second. If it’s a common occurance, that means you can visit them without problems right?</p>



<p>『I want to go up there!』</p>

<p>「Impossible」</p>

<p>『Eh? Is that so?』</p>

<p>「Very high」</p>



<p>It seems you need to use a certain magic item to get up that high, and the usage fee is tremendously high. Fran doesn’t know exactly how much it costs but it seems impossible for ordinary people to go up there.</p>

<p>Is it like how private space travel was in my old world? but, I want to go!!</p>



<p>『Hey, isn’t there any other way?』</p>

<p>「Seems to be some magicians who can fly up there themselves」</p>

<p>『I see』</p>



<p>In that case, wouldn’t Urushi’s Sky Step work? If you keep using it to jump ever higher…</p>



<p>『Urushi, how about it?』</p>

<p>「Kuuuu…」</p>



<p>It seems like it’s impossible. Well, I guess he’d run out of MP from such continous use.</p>

<p>Then, what if we use Floating? No, impossible. There is an altitude restriction for floating, and if you go above that it’ll just slow your fall instead of maintaining the altitude.</p>



<p>『I wonder if I can get up there with Telekinesis』</p>

<p>「Teacher, cunning」</p>

<p>『Hm?』</p>

<p>「Me too」</p>

<p>『Want to go?』</p>

<p>「Of course」</p>

<p>「On!」</p>

<p>「Well, let’s not rush」</p>



<p>That being said, as a matter of fact… No, wait! I got a flash of inspiration!</p>



<p>『Well, let’s give this a try shall we?』</p>



<p>I use Telekinesis to hover in front of Fran with my side up.</p>



<p>『Now, get on!』</p>

<p>「Get on?」</p>

<p>『That’s right. There’s no way you’d know about surfing. Anyway, stand on top of me』</p>

<p>「Nn…」</p>



<p>Fran seemed a bit nervous about standing on me.</p>



<p>「All right」</p>

<p>『Ou! Also, it’d make it easier if you used Floating. I’ll be using wind magic to weaken the wind resistance』</p>

<p>「Got it」</p>

<p>『Urushi, enter Fran’s shadow for now』</p>

<p>「On!」</p>

<p>『Then, let’s go!』</p>



<p>I made use of Telekinesis and Floating and flew upwards. Acting as a surfing board, with Fran on me.</p>



<p>「Oooh. Flying」</p>



<p>Success!! I’ll name it Telekinetic Air Ride!</p>



<p>Initially I moved horizontally. Fran seems to be OK with the movement. It seems to have been a good idea to fixate her feet with Telekinesis.</p>

<p>I turn right, turn left, go up and down while gradually increasing the speed. Good. It doesn’t seem to be any problems.</p>



<p>『Well, let’s go』</p>

<p>「Nn!」</p>

<p>『Oryaaa!!!』</p>



<p>I was flying in a spiral, going up smoothly. I don’t rise vertically since that wouldn’t be comfortable for Fran.</p>



<p>「Amazing. Teacher is amazing」</p>

<p>「On on!」</p>

<p>『Urya uryaaa～!!』</p>



<p>Telekinesis Full Power!! We’re gradually approaching the floating island. The island which originally only looked like a tiny pebble has grown to the size of a fist.</p>

<p>Even though I’ve already reached a height where clouds are racing by, the island is still far away. It really is high up in the sky.</p>

<p>The bottom of the island is just plain rock. I really want to see what’s on top of it.</p>



<p>『Fran…』</p>

<p>「Nn?」</p>

<p>『I’m sorry!』</p>



<p>I was becoming exhausted. It’s no good, it seems it was impossible to fly into the sky while carrying Fran. It seems that continous application of force is different from the explosive strength of the Telekinetic Catapult. I’m running out of magic power.</p>

<p>Perhaps, even with practice I could only fly for about 15 minutes?</p>

<p>If I become good at this it will be a new method of transportation, which seems to be useful for bypassing dangerous areas as well as escaping quickly.</p>



<p>「Too bad」</p>

<p>「Ouuu…」</p>

<p>『Shit!! Some day I will definitely get there! Just you wait!』</p>

                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h5>Chapter 63: Neel Village</h5>



<p>Two days after leaving Alessa…</p>

<p>We have arrived at Neel Village, halfway between Alessa and Darth. We made it in half a day even though it normally takes four days by horse. We got here so fast thanks to Urushi’s fast legs and my ability to get through swamps and over cliffs with Telekinetic Air Ride.</p>

<p>If we get another familiar like Urushi we could travel really far in no time at all by riding them in tandem, don’t you think? Thinking so, I tried another summoning, but…</p>

<p>It was no good. Why, why did the summoning list get all grayed out and unusable…</p>

<p>I could not find out much about that in the guild library, but I think my “Vessel” is simply insufficient.</p>

<p>Summoners refer to the upper limit for contracts as “Vessel”, and the familiar’s strength as “Capacity”.    </p>

<p>Vessel is as it sounds, while Capacity has a water-like image. A powerful familiar has a greater Capacity, and they can only be summoned as long as the summoner has the Vessel to support that Capacity. And, when the summoner’s Vessel is filled up by the Capacity of the summoned familiars it is impossible to make further contracts.</p>

<p>Urushi is a unique individual of a Threat Level C monster. It’s not really strange at all for his Capacity alone to fill up my Vessel.</p>



<p>『For the time being, we don’t have a choice other than to keep burdening Urushi huh?』</p>

<p>「On!」</p>



<p>You don’t need Telepathy to understand this. You’re saying you’re going to do your best, huh. I am happy to have such a praiseworthy pet.</p>



<p>『In the meantime, could you get smaller Urushi?』</p>

<p>「Ou…」</p>



<p>Well, despite that, I do not intend to pamper you.</p>



<p>「Gate is over there」</p>



<p>The village is surrounded with a wooden wall, it seems you have to enter through the gate.</p>

<p>When Fran presented her guild card to the guard at the gate he was quite surprised but we were able to enter without problem.</p>



<p>『It’s a tranquil village, ne』</p>



<p>Uncles with scythes giving of a farm-like aura, aunts doing laundry, it’s almost like a painting.</p>



<p>「Countryside」</p>

<p>「On」</p>

<p>『As you say』</p>



<p>We’ll be staying here for the night. The questions is whether there is even an inn here.</p>



<p>『By the way, is there an adventurer’s guild here you think?』</p>



<p>It might not even be 100 people living in this village. Would there really be a branch in such a small village?</p>

<p>As I thought so, there it was! Well, at least there is the sign hanging there. But no matter how you look at it, it’s just a normal house. Furthermore, it’s even smaller than the other houses.</p>



<p>「Hello」</p>

<p>「Oh, welcome?」</p>



<p>Even the inside is really a private house. It’s like someone just smacked a counter at the entrance to some old house.</p>



<p>「Girl, this might seem like a café or a tool store, but it’s actually a branch of the adventurer’s guild ya’know?」</p>

<p>「Know」</p>

<p>「Haa? Ehm, well, what do you want?」</p>



<p>Well, it’s not that we really want anything. We just saw the guild signboard and entered on a whim.</p>

<p>But, to be honest…</p>



<p>『Fran, let’s sell the material』</p>



<p>We picked up the materials from the monsters we beat while going here. It’s just from threat level G and F, but it will at least cover todays lodging.</p>



<p>「Want to sell this」</p>



<p>We took out the materials from the Storage, making the receptionist uncle’s eyes open wide in surprise.</p>



<p>「Where did you get this?」</p>

<p>「Defeated」</p>

<p>「You did, girl?」</p>

<p>「Nn」</p>

<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>Yupp, he has a doubting expression on his face. Maa, it can’t be helped really.</p>



<p>『Fran, the guild card』</p>

<p>「This」</p>

<p>「Girl, you’re an adventurer? Eh? Rank D? Haha, ain’t this well done～」</p>



<p>Treating it as a fake huh? Seems like he thinks it is just a child’s mischief.</p>



<p>「Still, it’s really well made. Can’t tell the difference」</p>



<p>The uncle holds the card over the crystal functioning as a guild card authitentication device. It seems like he’s going to check if it’s real or not. And, he gives off a startled shout.</p>



<p>「Hoho, it’s real? A real D rank adventurer?」</p>

<p>「Nn. Real」</p>

<p>「How surprising!」</p>



<p>From what he tells us, it seems like Alessa sends a few adventurers to Neel village on a half-year basis. He’s been stationed in this village for 3 months so he didn’t know about Fran.</p>

<p>However, he had heard that an amazing newcomer had appeared in Alessa from merchants travelling to Darth.</p>



<p>「Say, it was a black cat beastman girl, who’s terrifyingly strong, and so beautiful it makes the guild master cry? The so called Magic Sword Girl. I’d heard that you were no weaker than C rank」</p>

        </div>
        



<p>The first half is good; Strong and Cute. To make the guild master cry… Well, that rumor doesn’t harm Fran. The problem is the nickname! Even here it’s Magic Sword Girl! What the hell is up with that!?!?</p>



<p>『Fran, you’re being called Magic Sword Girl you know!』</p>



<p>I have ot correct it!!</p>



<p>「Magic Sword Girl?」</p>

<p>「Ou, that’s you right, Girlie」</p>

<p>『It’s widespread after all!』</p>



<p>If I do not correct it here, it will spread even further.</p>



<p>「Nn. Cool」</p>

<p>『Eh? No way?』</p>

<p>「I’m a Magic Sword Girl」</p>



<p>I’m apealing with a broken heart. Does she like it?</p>



<p>「I knew it」</p>

<p>『Fran! Wait a minute! Something like Magic Sword Girl? Is that OK to be called?』</p>

<p>「?? It’s good. Cute and cool」</p>

<p>『U, Urushi, what do you think?』</p>

<p>「On!」</p>



<p>Aaaa… He’s positive about it. Am I alone in this? What about the uncle there?</p>



<p>「How nice. I hope I’ll be able to pile up enough achievements to get a title some day～」</p>



<p>I have no comrades here!!</p>

<p>Are? Is my sensibility wierd? Is Magic Sword Girl a cool nickname? Seems like it’s seen as a good nickname…</p>



<p>Maa, if Fran likes it, it can’t be helped but…</p>



<p>「Oops, got lost in the story there. We don’t buy that here」</p>

<p>「Is not a branch?」</p>

<p>「Even if you call it a branch, it’s mainly here to contact Alessa」</p>



<p>Is that so? It certainly doesn’t look like there’s any money in a place like this. Probably, it’s just doing simple monster extermination and such.</p>



<p>「However, we do buy medicinal herbs and such. Since it’s used in the village. How about it? If you have any I’ll buy them」</p>



<p>Medicinal herbs huh? We collect stuff when we have the time, though a lot of it is poisonous grass. Even Urushi does search for it, but he too finds mostly poisonous grass. Is it because he is good at poison magic?</p>

<p>We don’t know its exact effect, but the seemingly dangerous poisonous grass has been piling up in the Storage.</p>



<p>「Poisonous grass?」</p>

<p>「Well, it depends. Some are used for pesticides or for producing anesthesia. Here’s a list of all different herb we’re buying」</p>



<p>There’s about 20 kinds listed, but we don’t have much of the ones on the list. The only one we have a reasonable amount of is Ghost Grass. I have no idea how to use it, but Urushi found a sizeable colony so we have a fair amount.</p>



<p>「Here」</p>

<p>「Oh, Ghost Grass. And it’s a lot!!」</p>



<p>Even this amount is just one third of what we have in Storage.</p>



<p>「Used for?」</p>

<p>「This? It works as a catalysy for Ghost Magic, and if you process it with alchemy you can make undead purifying potions」</p>



<p>Hohou, that’s some good information. When we get to the next city, should we bring it to an alchemist? No, it would be interesting to try it out ourselves too right?</p>



<p>「Then, in total that’ll be 7000 gorudo. Well, this guy can’t be found easily around here so we’ll be saving this」</p>



<p>Oh? is that so? We found a colony near the village quite easily…</p>



<p>「Actually, this area seems to have many areas where magical power has stagnated, and undead will spawn there. There are a lot more undead than normal monsters. Well, it’s mostly Lesser Zombies and Lesser Skeletons, so it’d not that dangerous」</p>



<p>（Teacher, what to do?）</p>

<p>『Is it the place of the colony?』</p>

<p>（Nn. Tell?）</p>



<p>Un, it’s fine to tell him. I don’t want to monopolize it and I don’t know if we’ll come by this area anytime soon. There is no reason to keep it a secret.</p>



<p>「Found a colony nearby」</p>

<p>「Hee?」</p>

<p>「This child did」</p>

<p>「That’s amazing. I’ve heard that some pharmacists train dogs to find medicinal herbs. Has that dog been trained to do so?」</p>

<p>「Have no done, but his nose is good」</p>

<p>「On!」</p>

<p>「hey, will you sell information about this colony? If we have such a place we can harvest it periodically」</p>

<p>「Intended to」</p>

<p>「I’m grateful!」</p>



<p>We decided to show him to the colony. At first, we were told to mark the location on a map, but we really don’t know the geography of the neighborhood at all. Actually, since I was carried around while we traveled I don’t really remember much about the exact locations. We’ll have to depend on Urushi’s nose here.</p>

<p>Payment would depend on the size of the colony, but it would be at least 50000 gorudo.</p>



<p>「I’m a rank E adventurer, name’s Argen. Nice to meet you!」</p>

<p>「Nn」</p>



                    <br>
                    
    < /br>

        <h3><strong>Chapter 64: Colony</strong></h3>



<p>With Urushi’s speed it takes 2 hours to the colony of Ghost Grass. Walking normally would take a day. We decided to move with Argen on a horse and Fran on Urushi.</p>

<p>Argen was quite surprised to see Urushi get big. Oh yeah, that’s right. He thought Urushi was a dog, and he turned out to be a Darkness Wolf. I will praise him for not running away.</p>

<p>However, Argen’s horse is terrified. It refused to get within 5 meters of Urushi while moving. It made Urushi a little depressed. Come on, you’re a predator! Don’t get down from a damn horse!!</p>



<p>「Urushi, good boy」</p>

<p>「Kuuu」</p>



<p>As Fran said that, we came back to a place I recognized. That rocky cliff, and that tree on the hill; we passed here yesterday as well. Over there’s where the colony was.</p>



<p>「In that forest」</p>

<p>「Hou, well done finding it」</p>



<p>It’s a small grove a bit away from the highway, which you’d normally not have any reason to enter when travelling. We could not have found it without Urushi’s nose.</p>



<p>「Thanks to Urushi」</p>

<p>「On～on!」</p>



<p>Urushi sticks out his chest as if bragging.</p>



<p>「Hee～ As expected of a threat level C monster」</p>

<p>「Urushi is amazing」</p>

<p>「Oon」</p>



<p>Don’t look so embarrassed! Because Urushi is so smart he really does have a lot of facial expressions.</p>



<p>「Well then, shall we go?」</p>

<p>「Nn. Here」</p>



<p>It’s nothing complicated getting this far. Though the colonies are in the middle of the forest.</p>



<p>『Hey, shall we ask a little about how to use Ghost Grass?』</p>



<p>I’m interested in magical catalysts.</p>



<p>「Um?」</p>

<p>「What is it?」</p>

<p>「Ghost Grass, how to use?」</p>

<p>「There are various uses, but if used as is it has a combined effect of poison and paralysis. It’s pretty dangerous if you eat it without knowing anything. Though I don’t think anyone would ever eat it by mistake」</p>

<p>「Other uses?」</p>

<p>「By making it into a potion. You can make a potion that only damages the undead, and sprinkling that on the ground can keep undead away temporarily」</p>



<p>So it’s like Holy Water?</p>



<p>「Also, it can be used as a catalyst to increase the effect of Ghost Magic. I’m an amateur when it comes to knowledge about Ghost Magic though, so it’s just something I’ve heard」</p>



<p>Hmm, there are a set amount of known uses it seems. It seems interesting to try out some experiments with it.</p>

<p>While we were walking and being taught about Ghost Grass, right before we entered the forest, Argen suddenly stopped.</p>



<p>「Argen?」</p>

<p>「Hey, are they really further up here?」</p>

<p>「Growing up there」</p>

<p>「Iya, understood…」</p>



<p>What? Did he suddenly become afraid? But why? There are no sign of enemies.</p>



<p>「?? Going?」</p>

<p>「Iya, but…」</p>

<p>「Urushi」</p>

<p>「On!」</p>

<p>「Uwawawa! Don’t push me!」</p>

<p>「On! On!」</p>

<p>「Uwaa!」</p>



<p>Arget got pushed by Urushi’s nose, fell forward and rolled forward into the forest.</p>

<p>Ah… Isn’t that too excessive? Arget crashed headfirst into a tree.</p>



<p>「Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!」</p>

<p>「All right?」</p>

<p>「Ah, yeah」</p>

<p>「Then, let’s go」</p>

<p>「I, I got it!」</p>



<p>Oh? Didn’t he say he’d return home already? Making him forcibly enter the forest if he doesn’t want to is a bit harsh, you know.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

        </div>
        

<p>However, this time it was Fran who stopped and tightened her expression. Well, I’m the only one who can see that change in expression though. I also know the reason why Fran stopped.</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>『Something’s there』</p>

<p>「Nn. Probably a monster」</p>

<p>「Eh? There’s a monster?」</p>



<p>Raising the level of Sign Perception was worth it. It seems Argen doesn’t notice it. Well, his highest detection skill is Chrisis Perception at lvl 3 so it can’t be helped.</p>



<p>「Towards the colony」</p>

<p>「Is that so…」</p>



<p>I just feel a presense, so I don’t know any details. However, if it was a really strong monster we’d be able to feel it’s magical power all the way over here easily. It’s not an opponent we cannot beat.</p>



<p>「Then, let’s go carefully」</p>

<p>「Nn. Urushi」</p>

<p>「Oun!」</p>

<p>「So he can even do things like that huh」</p>



<p>Urushi gave out a quiet howl. Then, a thin layer of shadow covered Fran and Argen. It’s a barrier that blocks of their life-signs. It covers the body like like armor so you can move with it active. Furthermore, it even shrinks the body a little, a perfect covert mode.</p>



<p>「Going covertly」</p>

<p>「Ou」</p>

<p>「Got it」</p>



<p>We slowly approach the colony of Ghost Grass. When we’re approaching the center of the forest we can detect the magical power of the enemy. It’s a magical beast of about rank E.</p>

<p>Fran and Urushi won’t have any problems, but it might be a hard foe to Argen.</p>



<p>「You should crouch a little」</p>

<p>「Ah, ok」</p>

<p>「Guruu」</p>



<p>We proceeded while protecting Argen. Light is filtering in from ahead of us, from the clearing where the Ghost Grass grew.</p>



<p>「…there」</p>

<p>『Human?』</p>



<p>When we looked into the colony from the shadow of the trees, something was there. It was squatting down in the field of red and black Ghost Grass and doing something. It seems like it’s picking the grass.</p>

<p>However, I do not know if it’s a human or not. It’s wearing a big robe with a hood covering the head. Although it feels a bit too thin it is human-like in terms of physique.</p>



<p>『Let’s take a moment to observe』</p>

<p>（Nn）</p>



<p>「It is slow, it’s slow」</p>



<p>The moment when the robed person stood up, we saw it’s face. And Argen suddenly gave out a shout.</p>



<p>「Wa!!」</p>

<p>「Who!?」</p>



<p>Damn! We were noticed!</p>



<p>『Shit! Let’s go, Fran!』</p>

<p>「Nn!」</p>

<p>「Ouuuu!!」</p>



<p>Make fast decisions. Rough estimates are not good, you need to be decisive.</p>



<p>『Skeletons have their magic stone in the torso』</p>

<p>「Decide with a single blow」</p>



<p>So, the thing wasn’t human. Peeking out from the hood is a white skull.</p>

<p>It’s a skeleton. I don’t know why a monster is picking Ghost Grass, but since we’re noticed we’ll take care of it quickly.</p>



<p>「Fu!」</p>



<p>Fran makes a great leap while drawing me, and Urushi runs along the ground like a black wind.</p>

<p>The skeleton starts to move but, too late! We’ll make it no matter what!</p>

<p>But, the next action by the skeleton was completely unexpected.</p>

<p>The skeleton didn’t pull out a weapon nor chant magic, nor even show any intention to dodge, it just held it’s hands above it head.</p>



<p>「Hiyaaa!! Help!!」</p>

<p>『Wait a-! Fran! Urushi! Stop!』</p>

                    <br>

		<p>New chapter. Enjoy.</p>
<p><span id="more-1973"></span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight:400;">65 Bernardo</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In front of us the skeleton is cowering while trembling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Pl, please spare meee～」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「?」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fran looks really confused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Aah! God of the Netherworld! Please, help me!」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Um…」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Hiii!! I’m not tasty! I have no money!」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Somehow, it seems like we are the villains here…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Oioi, Fran-chan! What happened!?」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Argen had regained his composure and was approaching.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「? Beat a monster?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Noo! Don’t kill me!!」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「What the? Argen too is surprised at this guy」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I was… I was just surprised because it was so sudden」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Don’t beat?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「This skeleton is someone’s creation, so don’t beat it」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Creation?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「It’s kindda like your Urushi. It was created by some Necromancer (Ghost Magic user) somewhere」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Then, not enemy?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Well, if it serves some evil guy it could be an enemy, but just beating it suddenly without asking questions is a bit too much. In some cases that could be considered a crime」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Is that so? If we take down this subordinate, we could be making an enemy of the Necromancer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I heard from Amanda that Ghost Magic is not considered evil in and of itself, and that the undead created by it are not particularly hated by adventurers either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Undead that spawn naturally are considered pests, but those that serve a necromancer are treated like a pet or subordinate, much like Urushi who is allowed into towns despite being a magic beast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I, I am a good representative?」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Your appearance is completely that of an evil-looking undead though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「however, this is the first time I’ve met a talking skeleton」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Rare?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Pretty much so. I guess it was created by a pretty skilled necromancer」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「My master is a genious indeed」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Oh, it seems you can not only talk but also have a fairly good thinking ability. It really must be an amazing necromancer」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Bones, what you doing here?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Collecting catalyst」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Ghost Grass is it?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Yes. But it seems someone has torn down a lot of it. It’s a shame」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It got torn down by someone? Is that about us? No, but if it grows in the wild you can’t complain if it’s harvested right? There is no sign here saying it’s someone’s field. That’s why we are not evil! Or is that not what you meant?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Are you growing it here?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「That’s right. Because of the dense magic power it is suitable for cultivation. I just provide fertilizer and water the field」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aaa… It’s completely a cultivated field. It seems like there is no sign because there’s a barrier protecting it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">According to the skeleton you would normally have a feeling that you do not want to go here, which is a psychological effect caused by the barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Right as we were about to enter the forest, it must have been that barrier which caused Argen to become frightened all of a sudden. It seems like the barrier is concealed somehow, even my senses didn’t pick it up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「A barrier that rejects people? Then, was it an application of magic of the spiritual control system of Ghost Magic?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Exactly」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">So it’s a type of spiritual control. Thanks to our battle with the demon we have a control immunity skill and Urushi has resistance towards mental skills so I guess we didn’t notice when we came here last time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「But, it seems like something that has penetrated the barrier. Like you people」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「…」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Argen was glancing at Fran, but that can’t be helped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">『Fran, it’s best if we apologize』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Sorry」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fran made a clean and deep bow. Good! Sincerity is important when apologizing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「What do you mean?」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We took out a bunch of Ghost Grass we had left and put it on the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Mistook it as growing wild」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「It was you?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Returning」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「No, I’m grateful for the feeling but, you should keep that」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Don’t need?」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It seems it’s no problem to take some and make potions ordinarily, but it seems the quality his master seeks is not normal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Just pick it up」</span></p>

        </div>
        
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Understood. But it’s not really such a great prize」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It seems like the quality of Ghost Grass deteriorates slightly when it’s touched by the living.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I was troubled」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Not using all this?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「How to say it? Ummm…」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「What?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I don’t know, I have to ask my master」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Maybe, if his master is concentrating on alchemy he could be really good at that too. It’s a bit wasteful, but it’s best if we still return this Ghost Grass.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Then, the skeleton asked me with an apologetic tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I cannot carry this much. I’m really sorry but…」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Got it. Will carry」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s something we got ourselves into, it can’t be helped…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Thank you!」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Argen. What will you do?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I’ll come too. I’m related to the issue after all. Besides, the colony belongs to someone, so I would like to ask if we may keep harvesting some Ghost Grass in the future」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Then, let’s go! Ah, I’m Bernardo by the way」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Name: Bernardo</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Race: Skeleton (Skeletal Undead)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Condition: Contract</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Status Level 4</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">HP:40, MP:183, STR:23, END:17, AGI:34, INT:122, MGC:61, DEX:38</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Skills</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Darkness Resistance LV.4, Sword Arts Lv.1, Harvesting Lv.3, Regeneration Lv.3, Vibration Operation Lv.2, Dark Magic Lv.1, Magic Manipulation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Titles</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">none</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Explanation: A dead body which moves through magic. Many serve a necromancer. They generally have a low intelligence, but posses regeneration and will keep moving until its Magic Stone is destroyed or until it’s magical power is cut off. Threat Level F. Magic Stone postition: Torso</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For a skeleton this guy has high intelligence huh. Magical power too. Even though the explanation said they have low intelligence. Is it not just a skeleton after all?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I am Argen」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I’m Fran. This is Urushi」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「On!」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Hou… A Darkness Wolf huh?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Know of it?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I have only received knowledge about it from Master」    (TL: Meaning he has never seen one before)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Bernardo looks closer at Urushi. Although it’s just a slightly special-made skeleton it seems Urushi is a bit afraid. Well, he wins overwhelmingly in combat strength though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I think we’ve walked for about an hour. In the middle of a wilderness, just north of the forest, there is a small hut.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「We’re here」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A small hut at a prarie, that’s what comes to mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s not at all big, and certainly doesn’t look like the home of a powerful necromancer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Ragged」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「My master does not care much about such things」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Fufufu. That’s right」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「!」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Guruu!」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">There was a sudden voice from behind. There was no premonition, even though I have the detection skills active and we even have Urushi here!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">『I couldn’t feel him!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">（Nn）</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">（Oun!）</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fran and Urushi are ready to go at any time. I also start charging up with magic power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Wh, Who is it?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「When asking a person’s name, is it not appropriate to name oneself first?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「M, My apologies. I am Argen, an adventurer」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Fran. Who are you?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Sorry. He’s my master」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">So, this is the necromancer in question!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If we had encountered him without knowing anything, we would have definitely attacked!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A dusky black robe. A multitude of skull-themed accessories. Morbidly white skin. His face was mostly shadowed by the robe, and all I could see was a wide smile that seemed to reach all the way to his ears. I think it’s a man, but I can’t be certain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">He’s super suspicious. He really seems like an evil necromancer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The necromancer introduces himself loudly while his rope flutters in the wind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Fuhahahahaha!! My name is Jean Dovey! The one who shall become the supreme lord of the undead!!」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I really don’t want to be involved with this one. I want to just have Fran turn around and leave the way we came. This guy was that really annoying loudmouth type of guy…</span></p>

<h4><strong>Chapter 66: Jean Dovey</strong></h4>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Fuhahahahahahaha!! My name is Jean Dovey! The supreme lord of the undead!」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It was a suspicious person in a slightly inaccessible atmosphere shouting a monologue. If there’s even an incident, there is no doubt this guy would be really suspected to have caused it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Name: Jean Dovey</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Age: 49</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Race: Demonkin</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Job: Dark Guru</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Condition: normal</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Status : Level 45</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">HP:180, MP:616, STR:91, END:93, AGI:119, INT:179, MGC:226, DEX:123</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Skills</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Darkness Resistance Lv6, Chant Abbreviation Lv4, Appraisal Lv8, Sign Concealment LvMAX, Kin Summoning Lv8, Staff Arts Lv4, Ghost Operation Lv8, Ghost Magic LvMAX, Dagger Arts Lv2, Compounding Lv7, Poison Resistance Lv3, Poison Knowledge Lv7, Fire Magic Lv3, Netherworld Magic Lv5, Medicinal Herbs Knowledge Lv4, Dark Magic Lv5, Absolute Sign Concealment, Ghost Rampage, Friend of the Dead, Magic Manipulation, Magic Power Boost</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Unique Skills</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Soul Eye</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Titles</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Scales of Assasination, Undead Creator, Slaughterer, Necromancer, King of the Dead</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Equipment</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Dragon Bone Staff, Dead King’s Robe, Demon’s Shoes, Bracelet of Death, Substitution Bracelet</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Absolute Sign Concealment? That certainly explains why I didn’t notice him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Regardless, he’s strong. His physical status isn’t that high but magical status and skills are considerable. He is just a little weaker than Klimt, the Guild Master of Alessa.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">And this guy is the necromancer huh. Being able to completely hide himself from detection means he can force you to fight only his undead in battle. I’d prefer if we don’t have to fight this guy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Are you a demonkin perhaps?」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Argen’s voice sounds quite terrible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Hohou! So you know?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Yes, you can glimpse the horns at the top under the robe, and those claws and fangs. Also, pure white skin is another characteristic of demonkin」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「You’ve studied quite well. Yes! I am a demonkin indeed」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Well, it’s rare to see one around here, so I was surprised」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「There are not many of us demonkin on this continent, that’s true. We mostly live on the eastern continent」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Are demonkin a type of human? I am a little worried, but it might be that my common sense is a bit wierd, like how I thought about Ghost Magic. Anyways, it doesn’t seem like demonkin are all enemies of humans at least.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「So, where are you guys from? It seems like Bernardo has brought you here huh」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Yes, they seem to have a problem」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Hm? Oh well, let’s talk in the laboratory for the time being. Come along」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Everyone, please come this way」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Is that cabin the laboratory? What should we do. I don’t think he’s an enemy but…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fran and Argen are already following him, so I guess I’ll just pay attention.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">『Urushi, pay attention you too』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">（On!）</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Hahaha! Welcome to our abysmal institute of darkness and death!」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">He’s acting extravagantly, but, the laboratory… Maybe the outside is just camouflage and the inside as a state-of-the-art institution with tons of equipment? NOPE!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s wider than I thought but that’s about it. Other than that, it was just a normal mountain cabin like I had thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Laboratory?」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fran seems to have the same question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Hahaha! Since my experiments are often accompanied by danger, the main body of the laboratory is in the basement so that the surrounding area will not be damaged. Do you want to see it? Fufufu, let’s say that curiosity killed the dragon. Kukuku!」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I see. Certainly, I can feel magical power from underground. What Jean says is true. On one hand I want to see, on the other I don’t… It’s the laboratory of a necromancer. It must be like a slaughterhouse! Corpses, one after another.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Here you go」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Bernardo is arranging tea cups at the table. He was wearing an apron before I knew it. It gives off a surprisingly human vibe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Thanks?」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Wow, looks poisonous… The liquid in the tea cups is a reddish purple. Is that really tea? Or does it only look like poison? However, Jean took a cup and downed it all at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Mm, this excellent fragrance. Exotic taste. It truly is the best」</span></p>

        </div>
        

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Really? Well, the Crisis Detection isn’t reacting, and we have Abnormal Condition Resistance too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「It’s ok」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fran gently returned the cup to the tray after drinking the mysterious tea. I’ll let her eat something to get the taste out of her mouth later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「So, Bernardo, what happened?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Well, the thing is…」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Bernardo explains the circumstances to Jean. Uwaa～, he’s looking this way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I see. Is there a lot of Ghost Grass?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「You can’t use this?」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fran takes out the Ghost Grass, but Jean shakes his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「It’s useless. If a living being has touched Ghost Grass even once their life force will contaminate it. It’s not a problem for normal use but it’s not useable to my purposes」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s no good huh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Well, it can’t be helped. I don’t own the land that field is on, and I hadn’t even put up a sign or anything」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「If you’re willing to overlook it we would truly be grateful」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「How about making the Ghost Grass you guys picked up be a present?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Really?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Really… BUT!」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Uh」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Jean suddenly shouted loudly and started grinning. Hey, you even shocked Fran! This guy’s behaviour is really hard to predict.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「To be sure, it was something I cultivated right?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Nn」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「There’s no way there won’t be any compensation right? Naturally, just lowering your head won’t be enough」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aah, it’s this kind of development? Well then, what will he want. Money? Or some medicine or material for an experiment? Maybe something we have to fight to obtain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fran and Argen are looking at Jean waiting, and the tension in the lab is high.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Shall I have this girl here accept a request of mine?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Request?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Yes. Of course, I’ll pay you the fee. How about 200 000 Gorudo?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Content?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Of course, it’s not compulsory. Even if you are obliged to do it, it’s annoying to make you do it」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Um, what is it you want me and Fran-jouchan to do?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「As for you, nothing」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Nothing…」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Yes. You’re not needed」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I,Is that so?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Therefore, you go home. Even if I sit here, it’s disturbing」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">So, it’s convenient if Argen just goes home? If it comes down to a run-in with Jean it’s probably better if he’s not here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Argen, bye bye」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Even jouchan!? Okay, I got it. Then let me be rude for just a moment, just once」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「What?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「She is still an adventurer, please make a formal request at the guild」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Fufufu. Got it. If I do not, will the guild be causeing trouble?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Well, probably」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Hou, Argen-kun, you played a good hand there. With this, Jean cannot ask something impossible of Fran.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I understand. Since I’m an adventurer」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">E? Seriously? I didn’t see that coming at all. I cannot imaging him walking through mountains and dungeons at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Is that so?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Really?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Yes. A Rank B adventurer!」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">He took out a silver card from his pocket while saying so. True enough, he seems to be a rank B adventurer. Ain’t he a senior huh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Then, I’ll be leaving it to you, ojouchan」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Argen said so and left. Still, it’s good that we got the promise to periodically buy Ghost Grass.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Well then, before moving on to the main subject…」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Nn?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Now we have no hindrances in the way」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Mu. That smile looks really evil. Is he suddenly revealing his true nature? Crisis Detection isn’t reacting at all!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「That sword」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">He points at me. Perhaps his target is me? Are you going to say you want to be offered me or what?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Now, don’t you mind talking anymore?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「!」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Kukuku, I understand! Also, the soul that lives within that sword! You can speak with Telepathy, can you not! Now, show me your true nature! Kahahahahaha!!」</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">        </p>
		
    < /br>

        <p>(A/N)<br>I’ve made an error! I’m sorry.<br>(TL: I have no idea what error he’s talking about)<br><br><br>Have my thoughts come true? What does it mean?<br>「……」<br>「My eyes can’t be deceived, my skill ‘Soul Eye’ is a skill that can the target’s soul! I’m looking at the soul directly! Appraisal blocking is meaningless! Fuhahahaha!」 (TL: wow, this guy is annoying)<br>Seriously? It’s an appraisal skill that can’t be blocked? Gallas had a similar skill, magic eye skills were scary!</p>

<p>Damn! What will I do? Should I keep my mouth shut? No, I shouldn’t hurry.<br>Jean nods with his hand on his chin, while the tension is increasing over here. 「I saw some rare things! Intelligent weapon for one. Performance is sufficient, and if I can borrow your power, my long cherished wish will be well within my grasp!」<br>『Wish?』<br>「Oh, so you finally speak. Sword, it’s a strange experience to talk with a speaking sword! It’s funny but pleasant!」<br>『Is that so.』Wow, it’s tiring when the tension is too high.<br>「Well, I’ll have to give you an explanation of the request so you guys can help me.」<br>Hmm? I feel like I don’t want something. Simply, he just wanted to know if I could really talk?『Hmm, you know I am an intelligent weapon, is there nothing else?』<br>「What do you mean?」<br>『No, I mean, do you want me?』<br>「Can I have you if I want you?」<br>『Never! I will not give myself over.』<br>「If you don’t want to give yourself to me then I don’t really have any interest.」<br>『Do you really not want me?』<br>「Well… I don’t need you.」<br>It feels like a lie, but he’s not lying at all. It seems he really isn’t interested. I really do not need him to be serious. Well, I feel a bit frustrated, but I feel more relieved.<br>「Are you satisfied? Shall I explain the request? Kukkuku.」<br>What kind of impossibly difficult demands are you going to throw at us? Thoughts of human experiments and assassinations are swimming in my head.<br>「The request is to aid in my exploration!」<br>It was an ordinary request. Huh? Really?『Exploration? Where are you going?』<br>「Well, I’m glad you would like to help me, the location is not far, and with me, you can arrive in less than 30 minutes.」<br>The place isn’t that far, I hope it is not a dungeon. Some say there is a dungeon around a field near here. But Jean has betrayed my expectations before.『Are we aiming to go to a dungeon with a den of the undead inside?』<br>「Huh?」<br>No, no, if there is a dungeon is that area, we haven’t heard any information from Alessa. What does this mean?『I did not hear this information in Alessa』<br>「Of course you didn’t. After all, I'm the only one that knows.」<br>『Did you hide the information?』<br>「Well, there isn’t an obligation of reporting it. Because disaster could occur, reporting is recommended, but it’s not that bad even if we don’t.」<br>「News to me.」<br>「If you report it you’ll receive a reward, so most would report, but the location of the dungeon isn’t exactly in this country, rather it’s not of any country, so there’s no need to report.」<br>「?」(Fran)<br>A place not belonging to any country? Is it a buffer zone or something?<br>「Fufufu. You’re troubled.」<br>『Can you tell me the location immediately?』No, maybe I don’t want to know.<br>「Well, let me tell you the history of discovering that dungeon!」<br>「Hmm」(Fran)<br>「Ask!」<br>『Impossible!』<br>As a result, Jean spoke vainly, sprinkled with gestures.<br>「About ten years ago appearances of the undead were frequently reported in the area. In the village of Neel, somehow, the sightings of undead were higher than other demon beasts.」<br>We heard something about that from Agen. So the ghost grass has been useful.<br>「Originally, as a necromancer, I came to survey the area. I continued my research steadily, scolding my heart that seemed to break sometimes, I made efforts through sweat and blood.」<br>「Ah-」(Fran) Fran, you don’t have to applaud!<br>「As a result, I made a big discovery! I found several strange spells of magical reservoirs! Fahahaha! It will be amazing!」<br>「Magical reservoirs?」<br>「It’s a phenomenon where the magical powers of the natural world accumulate in one place by various factors, and a beast is born from stagnant pools of magical powers.」<br>「Ho.」<br>「However, attributes that resemble ghost magic has been added to the magical pond I had discovered. Of course, it’s not that there was no magical unbalance among the puddle’s attributes. Volcanos’ magical reservoirs which have a strong fire attribute means it’s easy to create demon beasts of the fire attribute, just as water attributes are most likely to be born around water.」<br>「Then, from ghost attribute reservoirs, the undead are born?」<br>That’s why there’s a lot of undead.<br>「Yes, I guess it’s pretty funny though.」<br>「What’s wrong?」<br>「This is just a plain, I’ve examined records from ancient times but there’s no site of an old battlefield nor underground tomb. I investigated the vegetation and plant life, but the factors that might strengthen ghost attributes are missing. So why is there a magical reservoir with ghost attributes.」<br>「Well?」<br>『Hm?』 If you ask me, the big question is why?<br>「Possible factor?」<br>Jean suddenly got up and walking around with wild gestures, making the tension in the room grow. 「Someone is deliberately doing so! Well! I initially thought so, for example, it might be part of military operations of the Raids kingdom of the North and the kingdom of Belio.”」<br>『Was that wrong?』<br>「In the first place, it’s impossible to artificially create a magic reservoir and add more attributes and the likes. I haven’t heard of any succeeding but there are few studying.」<br>「I see.」<br>「Then I examined if there was anything in common with magic reservoirs.」Jean looks back at the bag and points to it. It seems like when a detective is showing off a guess. <br>「Soemthing?」<br>「Well, before that, do you know the existence of floating islands that travel around?」<br>It’s not that I know, but I’ve seen them. In fact, I could be challenged to land on one, but that seems impossible.<br>「There’s something that falls from the floating islands sometimes around here, it’s a plant growing in the upper part of the island, or a rock, it varies from time to time.」<br>『Is that what causes the undead?』<br>「What a person you are… it is. The magical pool of the ghost attribute and the position of where the objects fell were all the same.」<br>Wow, if I said the conclusion earlier the tension would have fallen. I bet he wanted to announce it himself. I sit on a chair and spoke frantically. No, this was useless.<br>「So, because I felt the island was suspicious, I went up there, and I found a dungeon!」<br>I have completely lost my motivation. Well, I wish it were quiet at least.<br>「The dungeon is a dungeon of mainly the undead, so the whole floating island is enveloped in the ghost attribute and is sticking to everything, including the objects that fall as well.」<br>「Floating island a dungeon?」<br>「Whether it was a dungeon core born in the sky and picked up by a nearby floating island or a dungeon core that occurred inside the floating island, as far as I know, that is the only floating island dungeon.」<br>Dungeon cores not only appear on the ground, but also in the sky? Does the core that was created in the air fall and crack? No matter how much the core is protected by barriers, if it falls from high altitude it will not come out unscathed.<br>「There’s no such thing, as the strange power seems to work and the core will not move from the spawned point unless there’s a special reason. If it is in the air it will be left there, so that even if it’s swallowed by water it does not move.」<br>「Reason?」<br>「For example, if the core on a floating island moves like this, though it’s an old record, it seems that there has been a dungeon core inside a gigantic golem that turned into a moving dungeon. It will be an exception, do you understand?」<br>Truly a mysterious object created by the chaotic god himself. There’s still so many mysteries.<br>「How did you get there?」<br>「If you become a magician there’s various ways.」<br>『Does the floating island not belong to any country?』He said such a thing a little while ago? Is it not the jurisdiction of the kingdom of Kranz that we are in now.<br>「It’s because of the migratory route of the island that a country can lay claim on it, right now it’s just a little over the Raids kingdom and the Belio kingdom. So it doesn’t yet belong to anyone. Even the landing troops can not be sent and so the existence of the dungeon is not cleared up.」<br>「I see.」<br>「But it’s a nasty thing, the dungeon is quite dangerous. It’s also a golden egg. If you know that there is a dungeon on a floating island where there is little danger of those on the ground, you will get it by any means possible, even if it causes military actions」<br>『Is it okay that we go there without permission?』<br>「I have to get it out of the way.」<br>Do you mean it’s dangerous?<br>「Well, I will say again, will you accept the request? We will go to the dungeon of the floating island and carry out a search of the inside.」<br>『How long do you consider exploring? Do you aim for capture or something else?』<br>「Of course, my aim is capturing. If you attack the dungeon and capture it, it would douse the fire between nations.」<br>Certainly if you destroy the dungeon core and get rid of the dungeon there will be no war over it. Huh? Is he actually a nice guy? Such a stupid… !<br>「But, if it seems difficult, capture a certain beast to return to the ground」<br>『Capture a beast?』<br>「What kind?」<br>「The beast’s name is Dead Eater. Undead yet it eats the undead, it’s a demon with a threat level B. Even if you can not capture it in the current , if you add the ghost beast as your subordinate you can make future progress.」<br>『Threat level B?』<br>「Originally I was going to use a potion of ghost frass to advance my capture but if you are as skilled as I think you guys are, it’s more secure than potions or anything like them.」<br>「I’m fired up.」<br>Well, what to do? Danger is dangerous (TL: no duh). However, it seems to be worth it. Besides, going to a floating island is a big deal<br>「What will you do?」<br>(I want to go to the dungeon.) (Fran)<br>That’s right. I do too. Besides, it’s an unspoiled dungeon, isn’t it? It’s also great to visit a floating island. As a result of consulting Fran, we decided to accept the request.<br>「Okay! Let’s do our best! FAHAHAHAHA! It’s becoming fun!」<br><br><br><br>(A/N)<br>It's about the end of the year.<br>The year-end and New Year holidays are full of busy season and plans at work.<br>I would like to continue updating every day as much as possible ... ....<br>I do not know how far I can go.</p>

        <h2>Unforeseen Insight</h2>

<p>We decided to take Jean's request.<br>​​「Well, let's introduce ourselves again! My name is Jean Dovey, the one who faced the darkness, looked into the abyss of wisdom and is the overlord of the immortal!」(では、改めて自己紹介させてもらおう！　我が名はジャン・ドゥービー。闇に蠢きし不死なる者たちの主にして、英知の深淵を臨みし者 TL: this is a little confusing, I'm getting a whole bunch of different translations.)<br>Well, while he is a necromancer, is he also a researcher? It somehow feels as if I'm getting used to Jean's actions. Unfortunately.<br><br>​​「I am Fran. Black cat family. I like curry and pancakes. This is Urushi.」​​<br>​​「Ou!」(Urushi)<br>​​「I'm seeing it for the first time but it seems it'd make a good companion if it was undead.」(He's talking about making Urushi undead and obey him)<br>​​「Oun!」<br>​​「No good.」<br>​​「Hahahahaha.」<br>​​『It's not a lie nor a joke that I am an intelligent weapon. The name Fran gave me is Teacher.』<br>「Ho, your name is Teacher?」Ah! Is it impossible for him to read the mood?​​「It's an eccentric name, it is! It's good, I love it!」<br><br>It was a funny one.​​​<br><br>「Nn.」(Fran)​​<br><br>The two people shook hands. However, I will negotiate so that the reward for the request will be changed slightly.<br><br>「Fewer rewards,」(Fran)<br>「Why?」(Jean)​​<br>『Instead, we want the magic stones.』<br>「Magic stone? Is that a good enough payment?」<br>『Yes?』<br>「Well, well, what are you going to use it for?」​​<br>『Well... ...』As expected, he asked.<br>「Hmm... ... I see, I see.」​​Jean brings his face closer to me. Being watched feels terrible!<br>『What? What is it?』<br>「The magic stone's value......」​​<br>『!』<br>「Maybe you can convert the magic stone into an energy of some sort?」​​<br>「What do you know?」(Fran)<br>「Guru」(Urushi.)​​<br>「Kuku, with my Soul Eyes secrets are meaningless. You want a magic stone so you have some use for it. It's a mystery but there can only be one answer!」<br><br>Wow, what vain thinking! It's completely perfect! In the first place, can he use such an appraising skill?<br><br>「You look frustrated, did I hit the mark?」<br>『So?』<br>「Fahahaha, it was a joke, but it seems to be the right answer!」<br><br>It's over! I've been caught by his trap perfectly.​​<br><br>「Goa....」<br><br>Urushi, don't look at me with eyes like you're surprised. You have wide eyes too!<br><br>『Damn!』<br><br>I've gotten stuck. I brush my hair back in my mind. You guessed a crazy thing! No, I may be influenced by Jean. Perhaps it hasn't done any damage to Fran's education. I might kill Jean if he laughes like "hahahaha" again.<br><br>「But if you're a magic sword that eats magic stones, that's fun. And... perhaps you don't only gain powers but skills as well?」​​<br>『!』<br><br>Hey, do you really understand? There's no surprise in your voice anymore. Rather, for reference, I would like to ask why. <br><br>『Why do you think so?』<br>「Is that actually right? Hahahaha, truly?」​​<br>『I never thought you could see through it.』<br>「Surprise.」​(Fran)​<br>「It's simple. The first thing I noticed was your skills, there were too many similarities, so I guessed that you could share skills with her.」<br>『I see.』<br>「That means that some skills are from your skill, but how could you have such a versatile skill? Even if you're legendary, how many skills could you have? I thought there must have been a way for you to grow your skill.」​​<br><br>Everything is being seen through.<br><br>「In addition, the composition of the skill is somewhat funny, so you can infer that you didn't grow your skills through natural means.」<br>『Huh? The skill composition is weird?』<br>「What do you mean?」 (Fran)​​<br>「Did you not notice it yourselves? For example, it's weird to have abnormality tolerance.」<br><br>Normally, in order to acquire abnormality tolerance, seven or more lower abnormality tolerance skills such as poison resistance and paralysis resistance are required, and it seems that the total of all skill levels must exceed 40. However, we only have poison resistance: lv.3; drowsiness tolerance: lv 1; disease tolerance: lv 3 and paralysis resistance: lv 2. Well, it does seem strange.<br><br>Besides, although Dark magic is only lv 2, I have Darkness magic. Even if I shouldn't have it yet, I do have it. There's also no swordsman, but swordmanship is there. The more I looked, the more the skills seemed weird.<br><br>「Therefore, I thought that you are acquiring skills with something else, though I thought that you could have taken them away with Skill Taker, but it feels a bit unnatural.」<br><br>His reasoning is perfect! No, I guess if one had a bit a knowledge and insight they could probably figure that out as well. If so, I have to be careful with people with magic eyes in the future.<br><br>Well, it can't be helped if this happens. I decided to tell Jean everything. I asked him if he could help us with collecting magic stones if we helped with exploring.<br><br>「Hahahaha! Good idea, it sounds interesting. That is, do you have to have the magical stone in order to absorb the skill from a magical beast that possesses that skill?」(TL: god, that was a frustrating sentence, anyone have any better ideas? つまり、君たちが持っていないスキルを所持する魔獣の魔石を入手し、師匠君に吸収させればいいというのだろう？)<br>「Nn.」<br>「Please assist me. I will help you two onto a large boat! Huhahahaha!」(TL: Where did this boat come from? 大船に乗ったつもりでいるがいい！ ED: Colloqial equivalent of 'I will help you get a big haul' maybe?)<br><br>Uwaa, this guy is suspicious, but the fact that he's a necromancer is authentic. The dungeon heading over us now is the undead dungeon. Some confidence can be expected.<br><br>「Do you know there's an evil spirit with skills like yours?」<br>「Where is it?」(Fran)<br>「Ou?」(Urushi)<br>「There's a high possibility that it is also on the floating island. Because it is the evil spirit of a demon beast!」<br>『Wow. What kind of evil spirit?』<br>「Huh, do you know the evil spirit called a memetic spirit?」<br>「Don't?」(Fran)<br><br>Jean laughs and shakes his head. Urushi is shaking his neck fur in the same way. I also do not know.<br><br>「As the name implies, it's a demon that mimics a wall and attacks those who approach. Well, it's not that strong so it won't be a problem if you don't notice the surprise attack.」<br>『What kind of skills does it possess?』<br>「It has mimicry skills as the name suggests. Its other interesting skill is appraisal disturbance.」<br><br>Appraisal disturbance seems to be a skill that doesn't allow one to be appraised accurately. Unlike appraisal blocking, it only weakens it. If the level goes up, lower leveled appraisals can be invalidated.<br><br>『Will we have our appraisal cut off?』<br>「A skill with good appraisal disturbance?」<br>「No, it's different! It's preemptive to this point!」<br>『Hey. Well then why did you talk?』<br>「Because I wanted to talk!」<br>(TL: The previous three lines are hella confusing, help. 『いや、俺達には鑑定遮断があるんだが？』「鑑定妨害が良いスキル？」「いや、違う！ ここまでは前振りだ！」)<br>「... ...」(Fran)<br>「Ku.」(Urushi)<br>『Oh, I see.』<br>「It's still a story that doesn't not matter.」(so it matters a little)<br><br>Sometimes among memetic spirits there seems to be a mixture of evil spirits, like a supernatural species, a spoofed spirit. (So sometimes there's a fake spirit that acts like a mimicry spirit) Since it is threat level D, it seems to be quite strong. But because it's difficult to distinguish from a real mimicry spirit, it seems weird to put them in a different group.<br><br>「And this disguising spirit is the beast I recommend for you!」<br>「Why?」(Fran)<br>「Well, as the name implies, it possesses a unique skill for camouflaging, which doesn't simply preventing appraisals, but allows you to show false information at a whim.」<br>『So it could purposely make someone come to a false conclusion?』<br>「Oh, that's the most fearsome part of the skill, it's far more troubling than just blocking.」<br><br>Appraisal blocking is a skill that prevents opponents from finding out information about you. In other words, the only appraisal result the opponent gets would be whatever wasn't blocked. The information that could not be obtained remains.<br>But what about camouflage? By releasing fake information, the possibility that the appraisal was prevented seems low, and if one believes the information they got, it will be easier to surprise them. In other words, you will be able to stay ahead in the war of information.<br><br>「And it's possible to combine it with appraisal blocking. After you block a little information and let the false information slip, the false information seems that much more believable! I think it's a very terrible combination.」(Jean)<br>「In addition, appraisal camouflage is a unique skill so it will also be effective against most magic eyes. Most of the skills in the demon eye system can be prevented with this!」(TL: I think I previously translated the demon eye system as the magic eye system but it seems they are two different things.)(Jean I'm assuming...)<br>「I want it.」(Fran)<br>『Oh, I absolutely want it.』<br>「Ou!」(Urushi)<br>「Fahahahaha, leave it to me. In the last exploration I already found where a mimetic spirit is!」<br>「Oh great.」(Fran)<br>『Truly someone we can rely on.』<br>「Ou Ou Ou!」(Urushi)<br>「Hahahaha! Don't be afraid to speak the truth, don't be shy!」<br><br>No seriously, I wasn't expecting that. Also, Jean might be a little cool. It looks like he's seriously shining. You may not be accustomed to being praised by people, but lift yourself by yourself. (LT: I guess he means that if you're be uplifted by praise, don't let it be other people's praise? idk)<br><br>『Ah! Too bright!』<br>「Oh!」(Fran)<br>「Ooo」(Urushi)<br>「Fahahahahaha!」<br><br>(ED: Wew, lots of comments to the previous chapter, always good to see. If you catch anything we missed or have any feedback, don't hestitate to let us know! Helps us improve both this chapter and others in the future!)</p>

        <h2>Ghosts</h2>

<p>​The next day, we went down the stairs. Last night I was asked to stay at Jean’s cottage...Well, the night when the mind is not so sharp brings a morning of refreshness.<br>Occasionally I could hear a mysterious groaning voice, explosions from underground and sounds of people moving outside my room. How does Fran sleep so well! I am glad she is a heavy sleeper though.<br><br>Breakfast is a fried purple egg and a black-green soup, and there was also a pale blue milk-like drink and fried mystery meat. The rest also had mystery meat and blue milk.<br>It seems that the taste is not bad, but it’s still scary. Fortunately it did not cause an abnormal state, but is it really okay? I confirmed it with Fran and Ursi about 5 times.<br><br>「Come here.」<br><br>After that, Bernardo guided us to a stairway so we could get down to the basement, where the self-proclaimed laboratory was. No, when you get down to the basement, there were plenty of facilities. It was rude to call this self-proclaimed.<br><br>「You seem surprised at the true form of our laboratory.」<br>『It’s pretty amazing.』<br>「Cool.」<br>「Ou.」<br><br>There was a huge magic circle drawn in the middle of the floor, tools like a sickle and a cane were hung on the wall and instruments like flasks and mortars were left in a cluttered mess. Poisonous medicinal herbs and ore sat in pots and baskets, and there was even a big kettle with a strange liquid boiling inside.<br>How nice! I would definitely call this a laboratory, it feels like a workshop. It has an atmosphere like a secret laboratory of a necromancer. I want to try all sorts of teasing!<br><br>「What’s there?」<br>「Do you mind?」<br>「Smell of blood.」<br>「Ha ha ha, as expected of a beastman, your nose seems to be good. This is the room where dead bodies are kept. It has strengthened walls for the more dangerous experiments I did a little while ago!」<br>It sounds casual, like some sort of corpse store. Truly like a necromancer. Did you die? Are we alright?<br><br>「Well, let's prepare. You guys have dimensional storages, so can you bring a variety of items?」<br>「Leave it to me.」<br><br>Should we carry luggage? Well, our odds of survival will rise, so I will bring as much as I can.<br>「First of all, with this and this, Oh, I will bring this too, that is also necessary, I wonder, I will bring this and this, anyway I am not carrying it. Then, with this and that -」<br>『Isn’t that too much?』<br><br>A small mountain was made on the floor in a matter of seconds. From potion-like objects to strange instruments, there’s a lot of variation. Inside, there were amusing skeleton-shaped lamps, pendants that simulated zombies, and tools that I would hesitate to even touch.<br><br>「Sniff」<br>『Those, Urushi! Stop it. Do not know what that does! 』<br>「Kuu ...」I can not smile because it could be seriously cursed.<br>『It can’t be helped, I'm going to put half of it in.』<br>「Hmm.」<br><br>While listening to Jean saying who knows what, we finished stowing the items in about an hour.<br><br>「We’re ready!」<br>『Is it finally time to start?』<br>「Finally.」<br>「Yes, let’s go.」<br>We left the laboratory with Jean leading us. The question is, how do we get to the floating island?<br>『What is the way to go to Floating Island?』<br>「Teleportation?」 <br>「Hey, I'm a necromancer, I don’t use magic like that!」<br><br>Does that mean there is a technique of flying in the sky for evil magic or nether witchcraft?<br><br>「Well?」<br>「Fahahaha. Well keep watching! You’ll know soon! Bernardo!」<br>「Yes!」<br>「Are you ready?」<br><br></p>
<ol>
<li>Where did you come from? B. When did you get here?</li>
</ol>
<p class="paragraph"><br>「Bernardo will guide you to the back of the laboratory. There is a magic circle about 10 meters in diameter, and magic stones were arranged on top of it in a regular pattern.」<br>「Well! It is good!」<br>「Thank you for the hard work.」<br>「Let's show it at once! Pay attention to the essence of my magic!」<br><br>Jean who screamed so, crossed his hands in front of himself and pushed up towards the bag and the sky. He began to recite spells without notice.<br>It is perfectly a behavior of someone else (Tl: it said Kitami, but who knows who that is), but now it suited Jean well. I was watching from the yards and I had no sense of incongruity at all.<br><br>「Cool」<br>「Ou!」<br><br>Well, I can’t deny it. Continuously spiraling while saying an aria, strike a pose, a spiraling magical spirit swirls around Jean as he continues casting spells, it’s certainly like a cool magician.<br><br>「----」<br>「----」<br><br>Even so, it takes a long time. He has been chanting for about 3 minutes now. It has this long of a chant.<br>And after another 3 minutes.<br><br>「---- Overspec · Undead · Summoning!」<br><br>Along with a powerful cry, the magic circle lights up in jet black light. It is such an overwhelming sight that the black light fountain is shining vigorously from the ground.<br><br>「Kahahaha, please come out, my servant! Your name is Andy!」<br>「Goo-san!」<br>『Wow! What is that!』<br>「Great!」<br>「Guruuuu!」<br>We saw the foot that appeared to crawl out of the magic circle, we were surprised. Fran’s eyes shone brightly, but Urushi raised his guard. I was also a bit wary.<br>When the ceremony ended, the skeleton Jean summoned exceeded the magic circle’s length of 10 meters. It’s probably a Wyvern. Not the Lesser Wyvern that I fought before, but the larger, more powerful genuine Wyvern.<br><br>「Ha ha ha ... ... How is Kuhahahagahogo ho! (TL: okay, what? Lol did he interrupt himself to laugh?) How is it! Isn’t it amazing!」 <br>His heart was throbbing, he was sweating and his breathing was rough - I guess it was more tiring than I’d thought… But the result is worth bragging about. It’s so cool, and has such a strong magical power...<br><br>Race name: Skeleton · Wyvern · <br>Overspec: Ghost Story: Monster Lv 30<br>Condition: Contract, weak point relaxation<br>HP: 1034 <br>MP: 433 <br>Foot strength: 539 <br>Physical strength: 551 <br>Agility: 531 <br>Intelligence: 10 <br>Magical power: 93 <br>Devices: 55<br>Skills:<br>Threat: Lv 6, Covert: Lv 3, Appraisal Disturbance: Lv 3, Depression: Lv 6, Reproduction: LvMax, Magical Barrier: Lv 5, Vengeance, Poison Invalid.<br><br>The status far exceeds Lesser Wyvern. Also, I have one skill I have not seen.<br><br>『A Ghost? I haven’t seen this before...』<br><br>Ghost Spirit: Complex skills of superior evil spirits who have a strong grudge.<br>Due to the influence of appraisal disturbance, the effect is not understood at the same time.<br><br>「The evil spirit is a synthetic skill that combines several skills.The effects include Flight, Magic use, Physical tolerance, Mental status resistance, Grudge conversion, a status increase, Light magic resistance, Recovery magic obstruction and Purification. It becomes a skill that combines weak points of necromancy.」<br><br>Indeed, it is a skill that combines various effects. It would be difficult to fight.<br><br>「Although it has beneficial effects such as flying, it can be said that it is a double-edged sword that also increases its weaknesses.Though we can reduce the weaknesses with our magic, worry is unavoidable.」<br>「Weakness reduction?」<br>『Now that you mention it, that’s how it is. The name is also something strange. Overspec?』<br>「Well, it is the effect of the technique called Overspec, undead summoning」<br><br>It seems to be a technique you can learn at Lv 5 of the Netherworld magic. Is not it a high level technique! The effect also has a tremendous thing.<br>Undead's HP, MP, strength, physical strength, agility of +200, play Lv + 5, weak points relief, unparalleled performance which is summarized by this technique. Instead, it seems that the undead summoned through it will simply disappear after 24 hours. That’s still strong. If the weaknesses of the ghosts are reduced, it will be enough for defense.<br>No, despite the insecurity of defense, I want the skills of ghosts. If equipped only at the time of movement, you can move by flight.<br><br>『Can you get Ghost skills if you go to the dungeon?』<br>「Do you want to be have ghost skills?」<br>『Oh, it's the flight that's in there that I want.』<br>「If it is then, you better absorb this.」<br>Jean takes out things like jewels from the bosom. It was a special magic tool that can summon the dead spirit who is the Lord of the magic stone by incorporating the Devil's Manastone. It seems to be called a summons ball.<br>「I will give you a magic stone in this」<br>『I think it's okay, I think it's a fairly powerful manastone.』<br>「It's fine, it's a demonic stone called Berserker Ghoul, but it's always a troublesome devil in a frenzied state.It attacks regardless of your friend or friend. Take it as if you have something to use Oh, but let us serve you guys! 」<br><br>So, I decided to have the magical stone and to be thankful. I will return this debt in the dungeon.<br>『Fran!』<br>「Ou!」<br>Oh!<br>I will cut a magic stone thrown into the air by the Fran.<br>It's a touch that absorbs powerful magic stones after a long absence. And I get a ghost skill, a decaying fang: Lv 1,. The decaying rot makes the partner rot, that is, it seems to be a corrosive attack.<br>And, vampire skills. Lucky. I got a means of flying with this. I might even be able to go to floating island by myself.<br>『I will equip it immediately』<br>「Okay!」<br><br>Devil skill set!<br>『Oh, oh?』<br>「Fluffy」<br>What is this feeling. As Fran says, it's fluffy and strange. I can see something. warm. It sounds like a sunny day ... .... Oh, I feel good.<br>「This is! Dude, hey, Teacher, you're dangerous! Get rid of your evil skill now!」<br>『Wow?』<br>「Gow Gow Gow!」<br>Something like rose is barking. It would happened to be towards?<br>「Are you listening? Get rid of your evil skills!」<br>『Nanka, like rising into heaven -』<br>「Master please!」<br>Ah, pleasure -.<br><br>◇◆◇<br><br>Ah, it was dangerous. I was literally ascending.<br>「Are you okay?」<br>『Oh, I'm fine.』<br>Apparently it seems that strong grudge skill is necessary, as its name suggests, in order to control evil skills. I do not have such a thing, evil skill set → no grudge → There is nothing to remember → Buddha! That’s what it seems to have become.<br>Fran should be like that as well, but it seems that it did not become a compulsory Buddha visit due to the connection between the body and the soul, instead it just became a state of trance.<br>In the case of myself, because the soul is contained in the instrument called the sword, the power to hold back to this world seems to be weak.<br>Evil skill is sealled.<br>「Well, I got interesting data! Thank you!」<br>『I almost died! 』<br>「Ha ha ha, I got a valuable information, is that not enough?」<br>Damn. In this case, he is seriously talking about his bad feeling.<br>『Hey. enough. Let's start quickly.』<br>「Then, get on Andy」<br>「Hmm」<br><br>「Because there are so many places to grab, hold on where ever you want」<br>Well, it's a bone. Fran is caught between the wings and holds the spine tightly. Urushi returned to her shadow. Jean is sitting on his neck.<br>「Are you ready?」<br>「Nn」<br>「Well, let's go, fly away, Andy!」<br>「Gowohoa!」<br>Andy started flapping with Jean's shouting. Thinking normally, there is no way to fly with the wings of the bone, but Wyvern 's giant ignored gravity and flew into the sky. It is an effect of the ghost skill.<br>「Fuha! Aim is the undead's dungeon!」<br>「Hmm」</p>

I feel touched. (TL: roughly translated to “It's Rapes! Yeah, I was touched!” but that felt wrong in more ways than one, lol. So I used a couple more sites to help and came out with homerun. Also, I think it was a reference? ラピュ〇だ！)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">Andy keeps flapping towards the island unaffected.</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">『Are we going in now?』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Well, what do you think Teacher? Don’t you want to finally rush into the dungeon?」(Jean)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Not on dungeon yet?」(Fran)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Dungeon is a term that refers to what is in the sphere of influence of the dungeon core, so whatever is in the sky, or rather, whatever the magic power of the dungeon core can reach is part of the dungeon.」</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">It seems Jean’s words have raised a flag as I felt massive signs of something coming towards us.</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">『Somethings coming!』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Until you land on the floating island, some demons named Bone Birds will attack you in a large flock.」(Jean)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Countermeasure?」(Fran)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Countermeasure? Fahahahahaha, just break through the front, it’s a flock of small fry.」(Jean)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「I see!」(Fran)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">『That’s not the kind of size we can just break through!』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「But they’re faster than Andy, it’s impossible to escape.」(Jean)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">『Is there something like a tool or a barrier to eliminate the undead?』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Tools like that aren’t convenient for such small fry! Though there is a technique to eliminate undead, I can’t use it so close to Andy.」</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">So we can only break through from the front? Damn, I’ll use brute force then!</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">「Fahahaha! Andy! Full of rage, but this is good!」(Jean)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「GOOOOOOO!」(Urushi)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Teacher!」(Fran)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">『I can’t be helped! I’ll do it loudly!』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Wow!」(Fran?)</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">That’s how we entered a battle with the Bone Bird flock. As individuals, they are G rank. However, there’s around 1,000 birds. Bone Birds cluster like clouds, even if they were knocked down or defeated, it feels like there’s no progress.</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">With the blessings that Andy releases, Jean's magic, Fran's sword swings, Flying around in the air and Urushi knocking down birds one after another, we’re bound to make a dent though...</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">「- Reverse Undead!」(Jean)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「- Fire, Arrow!」(Fran)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Gagaoou!」(A beast)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Gollo Ooh!」(A beast)</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">Me? I flew away from Fran. (TL: Not too sure about these next lines, seems rather rude to Jean) Everything was wrong with Jean. I will be missed when I become like this.</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">What Fran is using now was a phantom sword of the phantom stone that she took from Guillain before. Although it is a sword with the phantom attribute, it also has a small Light attribute so it was quite effective against the undead.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">Fran using a sword other than me ... I will endure it. (TL: haha, cute)</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">『Haha! An all you can eat buffet after such a long time! There’s so many magic stones to eat!』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">For the flock to be this dense. Even if we jumped around randomly, we would  be able to beat the birds without pause.</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">『It’s a Magic stone festival!』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Kisha!」</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Shogyo!」(TL: Animal sounds? キシャァ &amp; ショギョァ)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">『That won’t work!』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">They try to close my movements with the intimidation skill, but such a low level is meaningless to me.</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">Name: Bone · Bird : Undead : Demon Lv 3</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">HP: 18 </span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">MP: 6 </span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">STR: 7 </span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">END: 10 </span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">AGI: 16 </span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">DEX: 3</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">INT: 1 </span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">MAG:  5 </span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">Intimidation:Lv1, Beak Attack:Lv1, Evil Spirit</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">These guys gave me the skill of the Dead, but since these things are evil spirits I should be careful. Rather, I don’t think I’ll equip it anytime soon… Furthermore, Beak Attack is useless to me, since I don’t have a beak… </span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">After 30 minutes, we broke through the flock of Bone Birds and approached the floating island. When you see it up close, it’s really impressive.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">By the way, the skill Evil Spirit seems to be a combination skill of Flight, Magical Emission, Grudge Conversion, Light Magic Weakness, Recovery Magic Weakness and Greater Purification Magic Weakness.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">Also, I was told not to equip it. Not that I plan to.</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">「Okay.」(Jean)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">『Finally?』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「No, not yet.」(Jean)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">『What does that mean?』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「I will know soon - it came!」(Jean)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Same as Andy?」(Fran)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Fuha! It looks alike! Andy is a Wind Wyvern skeleton, but they are Lesser Wyverns! They are different grades!」(Jean)</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">Name: Lesser · Wyvern · Skeleton : Undead : Demon Lv 10</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">HP: 108 </span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">MP: 50 </span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">STR: 87 </span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">END: 63 </span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">AGI: 133 </span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">DEX: 12</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">INT: 1 </span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">MAG: 33 </span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">Threaten:Lv 3, Covert:Lv 2, Play:Lv 3, Spirit, Poison Nullification</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">It was a little weaker than the Lesser Wyvern I encountered before, but it seemed that it was going to be hard to beat down with the Play and Undead skills attached. And about 30 such people are there.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">Besides that, it is not only that.</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">『Wow! What’s that? Is that a Cannon?!』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「It’s a bombardment from the island. It could be a stray bullet shot by mistake. Teacher, concentrate on interception.」</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">『Well, what about the Wyverns? 』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「I will deal with them!」</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「You will?」(Fran)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Fran and Mr. Urushi have not completely shake off Bone Bird yet!」</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Roger.」(Fran)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Ou!」(Urushi)</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">It’s the last stretch until we can land.</span><br><span style="">I intercepted the cannonfire, sometimes crushing the shells directly and sometimes intercepting them with magic. Though there were a lot of shells, I managed to prevent us getting hit.</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">『Dangerous!』</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">It was dangerous. Although I somehow warped the trajectory with magic, if it was a few moments later we would have been run through by the cannonfire.</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">『Jean! How did you survive this shelling when you landed last time.』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「That time, I was following a Skeleton Griffon! For my fellows who wore wind armor, these attacks were useless! So, I got in from the front!」</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">Will it ever end? Besides, there is no longer that skeleton that I have not summoned now. It may be called out with overspec. (TL: Talking about summoning skeletons here I think? ED: … Taking advice on this mystery.)</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">「Gyo Oho!」</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">Damn, the wyvern skeletons are getting restless! But because we handled the storm of shells, it got out of hand! It was quite quick, and the attacks of the flock seems not to have been hit directly. If you hit it, you can beat it. (TL: Agreed)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">What is this? Is this not silly?</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">Andy buries its head into a wyvern, biting through fur with its teeth. It’s almost as if he’s saying “Count on me!”</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Thank you, Andy.」(Jean)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Goou!」(Andy)</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">But it’s only possible because of Andy pushing himself. It’s impossible to manage this number normally. Regeneration is gradually failing to catch up and Andy’s HP is dangerously low.</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">『Jean! What are you doing!』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Wait a moment! I’m preparing it now!」(Jean)</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">Then I saw it, Jean was in the middle of putting magical power into a summoning ball. Do you still have a trump card to summon?</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">「Okay! I’m ready! Teacher, Urushi, get back!」</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">『Roger that.』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Ou!」(Urushi)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Fran, keep still in case of anything! Believe in me!」</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Nn.」(Fran)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Fahahaha, that’s a good reply.」</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">『So? What are you going to do?』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「I’m going to do this! Andy, do it!」(Jean)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Gowawon!」(Andy)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Waa」(TL: Like awe I think) (Fran)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">『Deformed?』</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">//Unedited from here on)</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">According to Jean’s command, Andy’s bone body starts to strain and transform. The ribs and sternum swelled, wrapping Jean and Frans, the wings folded like covering the body. Because it’s flying with the evil spirit skill, it won’t affect flight...</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">It’s as if the wyvern’s neck is growing from a sphere made of bone.</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">「-Instant summoning!」</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">Meanwhile, Jean summons a new creature. Instant summoning is a technique to summon a part of a creature for a certain period of time. Although it is much weaker than the main body, there is a merit that even if the body is dead, there is no influence on the main body.</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">「Slime?」(Fran)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">『W-what? Damn it--』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「It’s fine like this!」(Jean)</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">What Jean called was a bright red slime. The slime started to wrap around us.</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">『Jean?』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「It’s okay!」</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">Jean said that we should stay as we are. Hey, hey, is it melting? The undead slime called Undead Ooze has completely covered Andy and the party. Meanwhile, although the shell is bending around Andy, it seems that somehow it is enduring. Though I don’t know how long it will last. What will Jean do?</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">「Andy! It’s been a rough time.」(Jean)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Goou!」(Andy)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Well then!」(Jean)</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">When Jean ordered, Andy changed directions with hurry. It’s form with his head facing away from the floating island.</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">「Gaaaooooooooou!」(Andy)</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">Andy unleashed a powerful breath that he had charged within himself. A tremendous ray paints the sky white. It’s super powerful without a doubt. Andy then curled itself up like a bullet and sped towards the floating island while crushing several wyverns.</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">「Fahahaha, good! Andy! You’ve done it exactly as planned!」(Jean)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Fast.」(Fran)</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">Andy’s magic power is decreasing with tremendous momentum. Hey, isn’t this dangerous? Certainly if an undead runs out of magic power won’t it disappear? But Andy did not stop releasing the breath and the floating island was rapidly approaching gungun.</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">「Make sure not to bite your tongue, Fran!」(Jean)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Nn.」(Fran)</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">Scary!</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">Immediately afterwards a light shock hits us. Apparently it seems that physical barriers were set up, but in front of Andy, those were useless. And….</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">「DOGOAGOAOSOGO!」</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Huuuuu」</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Aaa」</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Kyuwen」</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">『Wow!』</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">Andy made a huge crater on the floating island. Despite the fact that Undead Oooz received the shock, it was an incredible shock. Anyway, HP is decreasing for everyone. The body of Undead Oooz has disappeared. Andy, who received the shock the most, had not kept its original shape already. Both whole body and manastone are shattered. It’s only possible to distinguish half a skull.</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span style="">「Goou ... ....」(Andy)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Andy, we will not forget your loyalty.」(?)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Thank you.」(?)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Nn!」(fran)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「ou!」(Urishi)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">『You’re amazing.』</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「I'll send you the last at my end, sleep peacefully. - Ascension」</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Gou-」(Andy)</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">From the remnants of Andy, the light rises and raises to the heavens. It was a beautiful sight.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="">「Bye bye」(Fran?)</span></span><br><span></span></p>

				<p class="paragraph">Hey, sorry about the delay. I moved and no longer have internet at home unless I'm hooked up to someone's hot spot. I've also gotten myself a real job! AND, I know you were all wondering, I managed to graduate! Woohoo! It was a close call but I managed to get my grades up and missing credits made up! <br>This chapter is dedicated to you patient readers that were kind to me and each other. Also! Someone donated 5$ to me! THANK YOU SO MUCH! You're like the main reason this even updated, lol.<br>​<br></p>  <h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:center;">Rush</h2>  <p>  <!--BLOG_SUMMARY_END--></p>  <p class="paragraph"><span><span style="">Thanks to Andy, two hours after landed on the floating island.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">「I saw it, that's the entrance to the interior of the dungeon!」</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">We passed through the wandering forest of zombies and skeletons and reached a place like ruins.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">There were no noteworthy battles in the forest. The enemies are only lower demon animals,not smart enough to erase any indication of their presence. There are no elements other than a large number that are likely to be a threat. Well, if there’s something of note, it would be the absorption of magic stones and Urushi.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">There seemed to be traces of a staircase that descended into the basement in the center of a group of ruins.</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">「It's here, the last time I was exhausted before I got here, but this time I still have plenty of time!」</span></span><br><span><span style="">『What should I look out for? There’s plenty of dangerous traps, aren’t there?

It looks a little like a zombie? A mummy with good skin? It had such a feeling. Looking at it from a distance, it may seem like a slightly thin person with brown skin. It also wore clothes knitted with warp yarns.</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">「Thy name is Sercan!」(Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">「Va」(Sercan)</span></span><br><span> <br>//TL: This will be cleaned up by the Editor and the right words will be put in place when he sees it.

It seems to be at the expense of combat power, but playing power is not hampered. Looking for traps and dismantling them, it becomes a wall of flesh that takes on the trap with himself if you don’t do it. Well, convenient and incompetent.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">「Fahahaha ... I will go, Sercan, lead us!」</span></span><br><span><span style="">「Va!」 </span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">However, Sercan was tremendously useful. Most traps canceled out, or it starts and disables them.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">It seems that Jean has supplemented the magic power necessary for regeneration, so there is no worry of falling down or death.</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">「Va!」</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">Gashakon! (TL: Sound effect)</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">Oh, it was skewered to the spear that came down from the ceiling! I could not cancel it, nor catch it on purpose and invalidated it. However, Sercan plays it’s role immediately and walks as if nothing had happened.</span></span><br><span><span style="">I did not do a good job.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">In addition, Jean only said once, but it already grasped its internal structure (TL: I don’t know who’s grasping internal structures but someone is). We almost never stopped and we had been searching steadily.</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">The zombies that occasionally appear are destroyed before attacking fran with my attack.</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">『Good.』</span></span><br><span><span style="">「Well, here it is not」(Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">『What do you mean? 』</span></span><br><span><span style="">「The last time, supplies have run out in the hall ahead of us and we’ve had to turn back, so I don’t know what's in there.」(Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">「Is there something in the hall?」(Fran)</span></span><br><span><span style="">「There’s a monster room, in which you will see an intermediate demon beast」</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">Apparently there seems to be a stairway to get down to the basement in a place beyond that hall. The speed of advance will fall considerably. There’s probably a new gimmick.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">First of all is a hall.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">『Well, it’s all about the preemptive magic strike.』</span></span><br><span><span style="">「Hmm」</span></span><br><span><span style="">「Oh!」</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">And annihilation begins (TL: lol, I’m totes using that line somewhere). About 30 of the dead spirits collapsed in the first magic. Still, there are still more than 50 bodies left. But that wasn’t all. From the magic room (circle?), the evil spirits gushed out one after another.</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">Inside is mixed with intermediate demons such as zombie soldiers equipped with weapons and armor, skeleton warriors, and magical beasts.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">『let's go!』</span></span><br><span><span style="">「Hmm!」</span></span><br><span><span style="">「Guru!」</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">Well, it's not our worst enemy. Rather, a monster room without traps, it’s easy for frans to fight. Flame magic works well also.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">In only 20 minutes all the spirits were put back into the corpses. </span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">「well done!」(Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">『If you have this degree of opponent』</span></span><br><span><span style="">「Oh, novice」(???)</span></span><br><span><span style="">「Nom Nom」(Urushi)</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">Urushi is as usual. Why doesn’t eating zombie meat break your belly? Or is it rather tasty? No, it seems that everything goes well with rot, it's unexpected ... ...? Well, I hope it’s delicious.</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">「Do you have any injuries?」</span></span><br><span><span style="">「I’m okay」</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">Then Jean purifies the room and we decide to take a rest for about an hour. In the meantime I will make a meal but I take out the curry at the request of Fran.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">「Oh, supreme」(Fran)</span></span><br><span><span style="">『You never get tired of it.』</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">Every time let her eat it, she praises me every time. It is not a lie that if I had a tail it would be standing tall.</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">Jean also had had some curry, and he seems to like it quite a bit. I’ve changed it twice. </span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">「Mu」</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">Don’t look at me like that Fran! I still have plenty! The children become very aggressive when it comes to food.</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">Jean gave Urushi the femur of a Skeleton Lizard. He was gnawing on the bone, As Urushi  also experienced a blessing.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">Because I am have time and am taking a break, I decided to tell Jean about the undead spells. I thought of Amanda at the time, but who better to ask than the lord of the undead himself? I , but I would definitely know who heard the advanced party more than examine himself.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">「Kahahaha ... it is difficult to raise knowledge, but you have a good idea! It was good to hear!」</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">Jean is a researcher and I thought that if I could hear it would teach me .... Rather, he was a man of a system he wanted to speak, to talk about things not even heard. As a result, you got to know a lot about the evil spirit.</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">I was particularly surprised about the concept of the soul. I thought that the undead magic was manipulating the soul of the dead or manipulating it with the soul possessed by the corpse, but that was not the case. </span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">It seems that the power may cause part of the soul that should originally go to the nether world to stay in this world. And the fragments of the soul in which imperfections and power are put together are combined with the magic stone, transforming it into a powerful evil spirit.</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">So it was generally recommended that a necromancer cast a ghost spirit. Because they can be cleansed by serving a Necromancer and can ascend. For grudge who wanders while suffering with gratitude, it can be called salvation. Besides, if you serve as one body, you will also have 1 Vengeous Spirit that you dislike people. Among them are those who are going through countries to purify the evil spirits and ascend.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">「Well, I'm not that kind of fond of getting up to it, instead of ascending, I will lend you my power, a way of saying “Give and Take”. Even if I make things disposable, I'm grateful, so laughter will not stop, Yo!」</span></span><br><span><span style="">『I'm telling you, but you used Ascension for Andy, did not you?』</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">The technique of Ascension which Jean used for Andy was a technique to clear up the grudge of the dead spirit and ascend the fragments of the soul. It was a famous magic typical of nether witchcraft, which was also mentioned in the information examined in the library.</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">Although it is slight, it is a technique that interferes with the soul, so consumption is severe, depending on the strength of purification grudge it is even to reduce the life expectancy of the caster. Indeed, Jean did not become a fighting force for a while after it landed. Andy would have disappeared if it left as it was, and one should not use Ascension by force.</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">「Well, it's about that extent that we can do it, for a short while, for Andy who served with loyalty, he is for the hands at least, are not you complaining?」(Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">「No, not for such a good guy」(Fran)</span></span><br><span><span style="">『No complaints』</span></span><br><span><span style="">「on!」(Urushi)</span></span><br><span><span style="">「Is that so, right?」(Jean)</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">Something, it's a breezy atmosphere. However, Jean seems embarrassed that she made such an atmosphere. My ears are red. And, in order to change the topic, I just started to talk about the future by further raising the voice of the crowd. Well, it’s okay though.</span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="">「Fufa, Fuha! Well, next will be the second tier!」(Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">『Is there any information?』</span></span><br><span><span style="">「No, not at all!」(Jean)</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">Why do they look great?</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">「But please be calm. There are measures!」(Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">「What?」(Fran)</span></span><br><span><span style="">「This is it!」(Jean)<br>​</span></span><br><span><span style="">What Jean took out is a familiar summons ball.</span></span><br><br><span><span style="">『What's in it?』</span></span><br><span><span style="">「If you see it you will understand! So fufufu, you won’t forget it!」</span></span><br><br><span><span style="">Then Jean began to recite the summoned spell again.</span></span></p>

Even I cannot catch the fume like fly.</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Oooh” (Fran)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Wow” (Teacher)</span></span><br><span><span style="">Just this is interesting. The white smoke stagers over and over. If we weren’t inside the dungeon, we wouldn’t be able to see it.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">“Fly can send information from the map creation to me through the mind! Even without doing anything, you can get a map of the dungeon! Kahahaha! I cannot get rid of this shaking by myself!” (TL: I guess he’s excited?) (Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">Certainly, without Fly, mapping would be crazy.</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Go, Fly!” (Jean)</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">By Jean’s order, the fly begins to divide into twenty bodies. One body is weak but it’s not battle power we’re concerned about. Fly starts to move quietly. At first glance it seems like the smoke is following the air current.</span></span><br><span><span style="">“After about ten minutes we can get a map of what’s up ahead.”</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Leave it to me!” (Fly?)</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">Is it not pampant yet? It’s only a small fish. (TL: I think it’s talking about the amount of ghasts that are running about) Fran is posing with Urushi, having a motivated face.</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Last time I didn’t do this to find out about the floors. I just went ahead to scout.” (Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“So is this structured floors in your mind?” (Teacher) Certainly you’re not saying there’s no information of this floor at all?</span></span><br><span><span style="">“No, I couldn’t break through this area before, so I don’t know the layout ahead, but there’s no problems as we’ve made improvements.” (Jean)</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">“Don’t you understand what’s ahead?” (Teacher)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Well, there’s something that I know of only one. It’s the mimic spirit you’re looking for, but it appears up ahead. They are the one that blocked Fly’s way.” (Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Really? Okay, let’s go!” (Teacher)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Nn.” (Fran)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Ou!” (Urushi)</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">“Before we go, let’s have a drink before the battle” (Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“What is this?” (Teacher)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Fuhahaha! It’s a specially made spirit potion. It has the effects of reducing damage from the dead and increasing resistance against special attacks such as spirit control.” (Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Amazingly high-performance! Isn’t it petty valuable.” (Teacher)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“It's not a big deal. If it’s on the market, it’s about 200,000 gold.” (Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“High!” (Teacher or Fran, I forgot)</span></span><br><span><span style="">200,000 gold is the same as the reward for success. Is this okay?</span></span><br><span><span style="">“For me, it’s not that much money, don’t mind it! We’ll just take more than that in materials.” (Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">Truly a B rank adventurer. 200,000 is a lot of money</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">“Let’s get to it” (Fran)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Also, feel free to use stuff I give you. It’s me who will be troubled if you leave.” (Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">I’m happy with this type of client, because I am a poor man. I hesitate to use items, even with RPGs, leaving things like elixirs and world trees (TL:?? Unfamiliar with RPGs and items in them) until the end. But that’s dangerous. If Fran was in danger, I guess I wouldn’t say such a thing, but that’s how I usually think.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">“We’re going into a long corridor where it extends to the entrance to the second floor, enemies there use hypnotism attacks.” (Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Well then!” (Teacher)</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">“Oooo… …” (spirit)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Damn! THis one is also different! Well then, you!” (Jean?)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Oo”</span></span><br><span><span style="">“This is not it!” (Teacher)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Oooh”</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Owio” (spirits)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Ah! This is annoying! Which is the spoofed spirit?” (Teacher)</span></span><br><span><span style="">Ghost, Specter, etc. attacks back and for forth, right and left, sometimes coming through walls and floor to attack.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">But this was the corridor we’ve been looking for. There’s mimic spirits among the attacks. There’s also spoofed spirits which are like subordinates of the mimic spirits.</span></span><br><span><span style="">We are constantly activating the fire attribute to maximize damage, they continue to disguise as dead spirits. Our strategy would be impossible without the magic tank called me. Actually, I raised the level of magic absorption.</span></span><br><span><span style="">Because the bodies of the spirits in the dead system consists of magical power, they’re weak against absorption.</span></span><br><span><span style="">So, because of attacking and magical supply, magic absorption increased to level 3.</span></span><br><span><span style="">With this, the remaining points have decreased to one, but it’s a skill that’ll be advantageous in the long run, I think there’s no loss in raising it. (TL: I guess rather than saying he raised it naturally through combat, he used points to raise the level artificially, it was a little confusing so I thought I’d explain)</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">As a result, if combined with attribute sword, most of the spirits could be knock down in a single shot. My magic power is still around 1500. Afterwards, it would be perfect if I could take an appraisal camouflage from a spoofed spirit.</span></span><br><span><span style="">Actually, it’s easier to annihilate with widespread magic. Then destroy magic stones. I just want to get appraisal camouflage by all means.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">“Jean! I can’t find a camouflage spirit?” (Teacher)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Mm, I have not.” (Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Are you sure?” (Teacher)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“I don’t understand?” (Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">(TL: okay, I have no idea on this next like [</span><span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34)">いると信じて戦うんだ</span><span style="">]) “Believe that’s you’re fighting and fight!” (Teacher)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Ou ou” (Urushi)</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">It also places a considerable burden on Fran. If you think that it’s a mimic spirit and attack it, there’s a chance of it being a spoofed spirit. In order to prevent damage to the magic stones, I only have try to attack the mimic spirits.</span></span><br><span><span style="">Then Fran only has to deal with the spirits other than the mimics. </span></span><br><span><span style="">The spiritual abnormality coming from the ghosts are not at all an issue due to Jean’s spirit potion. Physical attacks aren’t a big deal. To Fran, they’re only annoying.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">Then 30 minutes into the fight.</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Now is…” (Teacher)</span></span><br><span><span style="">Mimic spirits have a lot of magic I feel like. I hurriedly check my skills.</span></span><br><span><span style="">Obtained appraisal camouflage.</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Damn! It came!” (Teacher)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Yosh! This is good already.” (Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Ou!” (Urushi)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“At last” (Fran)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Oooo” (Fly?)</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">After that, the furious fighting kept for half an hour more, soon settled down. Everybody used widespread magic so it was completed because of that.</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Nn?” (Fran)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Oh?” (Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">No, even I can see. I wanted camouflage. Well, since it might be hard work, let’s give up. (TL: This was confusing as well [</span><span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34)">鑑定偽装が欲しかったんだ。まあ、必要な苦労だったと思って、諦めてくれ</span><span style="">])</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">“Congratulations” (Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“I tried to set it, but how is it? Can you see with soul eye? I tried to conceal the skill and to make it look lower than the actual status.” (Teacher)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Hmm… Well, it’s a success, it looks like half the status I saw before.” (Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“What about skills?” (Fran)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“I don’t see any skills at all, however, it’s better to research a little more. It’s doubtful that you don’t have any skills. We should adjust it so that it looks safe.” (Jean)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Oh, I know.” (Teacher)</span></span><br><span><span style="">How to disguise it?</span></span><br><span><span style="">Well, I’m having fun. Showing the disguised status to those who appraise Fran. “Fighting strength is just 5, garbage.” Let me think, it’s also possible to do, “I have 530,000 battles.” (TL: He’s talking about what others might think when they see with appraisal for the first one. The second one was more like blowing people out of the water with shock, lol)</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="">“Kukuku, I’m looking forward to it.” (Teacher)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Teacher, bad voice.” (Fran)</span></span><br><span><span style="">“Ouou” (Urushi)</span></span></p>

		<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fly was quite a bit more useful than I’d anticipated. We didn’t really know anything about the second floor, but his abilities allowed us to advance through it as quickly as we had on the first. He even managed to find a treasure box along the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Our trek was going smoothly. We basically hadn’t stopped since we broke through that one corridor with all the specters.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span id="more-21"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Seeing fly in action makes me want one of his species in my party. I wonder if leveling up ghost magic’ll let me get my hands on something like him?</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">I decided to ask Jean about it, but he ended up cutting my hopes short. Apparently you needed all sorts of high quality magic tools and herbs to make it, so each specter would end up costing at least 10 million Gorudo. Actualizing it was a whole another matter, and that’d apparently take another 3 or so years in and of itself. To make matters worse, every single individual was different, and so not all of them would be able to use Shadow Clones the same way the one Jean summoned could. </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">In other words, you needed all three of money, time, and luck. Yeah, I guess that’s not happening. I’ll have to give up on the idea for now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Bored.」</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Ahahaha! Do you not think it wonderful to be able to experience boredom as you journey through a dungeon?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Still bored.」</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Well, I guess that’s pretty much something that’s been due. I’ve been handling all the battles and stuff, so Fran’s started to get frustrated out of sheer monotony.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Well then…」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Hm?」</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「It appears as if Fly’s found us a set of stairs.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">『Already!?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Already indeed. However, it seems as if the area is being secured by a guardian, a massive zombie with a large horn sticking out its head. There are quite a few other zombies around it as well.」</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Really?」</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Oh god damn it Fran, why is that your eyes started to sparkle the moment you heard that?</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Hahaha! How ever reliable you are!」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Leave it to me.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Woof!」</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Hahahaha! Then why don’t we be on our way? Let us advance, for it has come time to exterminate the undead!」(TL Note: Lit. Exterminate Oni. Reference to Momotarou.)</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Though, it looks like we’ve got a black cat, a sword and a wolf instead of a talking chicken, a monkey, and a dog, but whatever. Either way, it looks like we’re going to be getting something much better than a mere kibidango or two, so I’ll give it my all.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">We grab the treasure chest and then head over to the corridor leading to the stairs, where we rendevouz with Fly, who was standing by with all his parts merged back into one.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">According to Jean's Undead Search, the corridor was filled with a  large zombie, twenty odd soldier type zombies, and about a hundred zombified dogs and rats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">『Alright, let’s charge in and then start by throwing a few AOE spells.』</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Understood.」</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Woof.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Getting swarmed by all those mini zombies is probably going to be more of a pain in the ass than fighting the big one, so it’d be better for us to go with the Lv. 8 wind spell Gale Hazard. The spell isn't too much of a hard hitter, but it compensates by covering a large area. It’s AOE is about 30 meters in either direction, so we should be able to cover the entire corridorif Fran and I both use it at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">『I’ll leave all the soldier-types to you, Woofy.』</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Woof woof!」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「What about Jean?」</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I shall spend my time doing what I can against that larger zombie over there. Serkan, Fly, wait here.」</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Va」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「…」</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">『Alright, let’s go.』</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Nn.」</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">It's finally time for us to take on the floor boss! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">『「――Gale Hazard」』</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Violent Winds rage within the corridor and smash all of the smaller scaled magic beasts</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Arooo!」</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Woofy pierce’s four different zombie soldiers with its dark spears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Hahahahahaha! How overwhelming you are!」</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Jean gives a loud laugh as he completes his task with ease. He traps the giant zombie inside of an Undead Jail and keeps it from moving.</span></p>

        </div>
        
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">『We’ll be leaving that big ass one to you then, Jean!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「First, small fry.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Woof!」</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">We leap into the zombie horde.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">The zombie soldiers are a bit troublesome to deal with. They’re far more agile and skillful than what you’d normally expect from zombies, and they’re able to counter attack for quite a bit of damage — not that it matters to us since we can get rid of them in a matter of moments.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Fran starts by cloaking her blade in flames and using her sword arts to chop their arms, and in doing so, completely negates their ability to counterattack. She then destroys their heads and splits their bodies in half. The damage from this combination instantly defeats them, she inflicts far too much damage for them to regenerate. Fire is especially effective against zombies because it naturally hinders their self restoration.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">That said, she seems a bit dissatisfied that she wasn’t able to use lightning, her favourite element. On the other hand, I'd say I'm pretty content. The flame cloaked blade reminds me of Gundams and their beam sabers.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Woofy was fighting in a much flashier fashion. He was using a mix of fang and magic to completely grind the zombies to dust. His fur’s starting to get dirty though, so I’m going to have to give him a wash later.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Things were going pretty smoothly for me too. All I have to do is use magic perception to find their magic stones and pierce right through them in one go.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">The hallway is kind of reminiscent of what we ran into on the first floor. Spirits keep gushing out of the corpses and end up all over the room. Heh, what good experience points they are.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">The spirits stopped spawning after we beat all the grunts though, so before long, we were left with nothing but the giant zombie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">『Orya!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Woof!」</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">And even that was killed instantly. Jean made it stop moving, so I easily pierced through its magic stone by launching myself with telekinetic catapult. </span></p>

</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Oh hell yeah! I can start leveling stuff up again! Alrighty, what should I level up this time? Or wait, maybe I should hold my points till we’re out of the dungeon first.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>

</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">That said, it seems like we’re having a pretty easy time right now. The dungeon’s interior is much easier to get through than the exterior was. I wonder if I’m just overthinking things…</span></p>

    < /br>

        
		<p>74: To the Depths!</p>
<p>We continued to fight zombies and skeletons as we made our through the dungeon’s third floor. The traps were getting more dangerous, but Serkan’s abilities let us breeze right through them.</p>
<p>We’ve managed to progress at a pretty good pace without tiring ourselves out.<span id="more-46"></span></p>
<p>All that’s left is for us is to find the Spirit Eater Jean was looking for. If things go well, we might even be able to conquer the dungeon while we’re at it.</p>
<p>『So what kind of magic beast is this Spirit Eater thing anyways? What’s it look like?』</p>
<p>「Hahahaha! I have absolutely no idea.」</p>
<p>『Wait, aren’t we supposed to be capturing it? You should have some sort of idea at least…』</p>
<p>「Its appearance used to match that of your average zombie, but the consumption of its peers has led to its evolution. It had become a giant the last time I laid eyes on it, and I believe it has likely evolved even further. I can no longer fathom its form.」</p>
<p>『Where'd you last see it?』</p>
<p>「My last sighting of it was just outside the dungeon’s entrance. It was a member of what I believe to be a squad the dungeon master called upon to drive me away.」</p>
<p>「Couldn’t beat them?」</p>
<p>「Indeed. It is regrettable, but I have to admit that not even my experience in necromancy was enough allow me to forge a plan that would lead to my victory. All of the schemes I’d conjured had led only to the Spirit Eater throwing me down its hatch.」</p>
<p>『Sounds like quite the opponent.』</p>
<p>「Yes, but that is precisely why I would not mind if we are unable to succeed in its capture. We have no idea as to its whereabouts, and I only desired for it because I wished to use its powers to conquer the dungeon. I’ve no need for it with companions like yourselves by my side.」</p>
<p>『So we don’t have to go looking for it?』</p>
<p>「That is correct.」</p>
<p>And with that, we continued to advance through the dungeon, our sights set on only its deepest depths.</p>
<p>It took us two days to traverse its top eight floors. By the time we got to the ninth, we'd already ran into some rank D monsters like Hellhounds, Zombie Nagas, Skeletons and Dark Paladins.</p>
<p>Jean’s support was quintessential. We honestly probably wouldn’t have made it this far without him. His ability to make purify and take control of the undead within a dungeon composed solely thereof allowed him to act like something along the lines of a Joker in a game of cards.</p>
<p>The items he brought along were super useful too.</p>
<p>His skull shaped lamp turned out to be something incredible. It could create safe zones that warded off the undead so long as we stayed inside of them. Thanks to that, we were able to get ourselves a good night’s rest despite the fact that we were in the middle of a dungeon. Though, I did feel a bit revolted by the fact that zombies would end up circling the safe zone while making the ever so anticipated “ahhhh” sounds. I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and respect for both Fran and Jean, as both were able to get right to sleep despite the zombies.</p>
<p>That said, it was pretty obvious that Jean was still much more comfortable with our conditions than Fran was. Jean would put up a safe zone whenever we stopped to eat, and naturally, zombies would end up circle us just like they did when we went to bed. Fran would end up making a bit of a disgusted face as a result, but Jean was able to keep eating as if nothing was wrong at all.</p>
<p>I knew he was a necromancer and figured that he was probably used to stuff like this, but honestly, I was still a bit shocked. I mean, those are zombies, you know? They’re literally walking, rotting corpses. Some of them even look like they're falling apart at the seams.</p>
<p>On a side note, I tried shapeshifting a few times as we fought our down into the dungeon’s depths.</p>
<p>I was able to transform into an axe, a spear, and even a dagger, not that any of those forms ended up being of much use. There were quite a few problems with the skill. First and foremost was that it continued to consume an incredible amount of mana so long as I remained transformed. There was also the fact that we didn’t point any other weapon’s arts. The most annoying part of it all was that my mass had to stay constant, so I couldn’t even turn into any sort of larger weapon either.</p>
<p>I’m sure that there’s gotta be some other way to use the skill, but it’s going to have to sit on the backburner for now.</p>
<p>『Looks like we’ve reached the ninth floor’s boss room.』</p>
<p>The dungeon’s been set up so that each floor is a labyrinth of sorts. The only thing about that’s really stayed constant is the fact that every floor’s ended with a large room with a boss in it.</p>
<p>It’s marked by the same kind of door every time too, so I know for sure that the room we’re about to enter right now is the boss' room.</p>

</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>The bosses we’ve fought thus far are as follows: an ogre zombie, a skeleton tiger, a dragonoid zombie, a naga skeleton, an orthrus zombie, a chimera skeleton, and an elder zombie (Great Superior Rank). Each boss was stronger than the last, and the elder skeleton we fought on the eighth floor was even equipped with a magic spear. It knew how to use divine spear arts and divine spear techniques, so it made for an extremely difficult foe.</p>
<p>It even managed to drop Fran’s HP below the halfway point. Though, on the bright side, defeating it allowed us to gain access to both Divine Spear Arts and Divine Spear Techniques. I wonder if that means my spear form might end up seeing some use after all.</p>
<p>「Now, why don’t we go ahead and open the door?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The room was filled with naught but a single skeleton. What kind of foe will it be, I wonder…</p>
<p>『Flare Blast!』</p>
<p>「Hexagonal Tornado!」</p>
<p>「Hell Blaze!」</p>
<p>「Arooo!」</p>
<p>We start with our usual strategy. All four of us simultaneously bombard the skeleton with magic.</p>
<p>「It is still capable of movement!」</p>
<p>That's a bit of an understatement. In fact, it doesn’t feel like we’ve done any damage to it whatsoever.</p>

_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>The skeleton begins to rise. I feel a sense of urgency overcome me as its crimson bones rattle within its golden armour. The sheer amount of magical energy emanating from its body tells me that it’s threat level is no lower than B.</p>
<p>It’s a monster on par with the demon we slew. It’s status reveals that it’s got far fewer tactics at hand; its skills were instead focused on enhancing its defensive prowess.</p>
<p>It was in possession of Lv 8 regeneration, Lv 9 resistance to abnormal status, Lv 9 resistance to mental abnormalities, and Lv 9 magic resist. On top of that, it even wore orihalcum armour, a type of armour that focused on boosting its magic resist even further. All those resistances meant that attacking it with spells simply wasn’t going to get us anywhere.</p>
<p>『Jean, pull back.』</p>
<p>「Of course. It appears that I’ve got quite the poor matchup against this here skeleton. I will focus on Healing.」</p>
<p>『Urushi, your job will be to protect Jean. Make sure you keep an eye out too, just in case any other undead show up.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>The skeleton would end up facing off against Fran.</p>
<p>「Master.」</p>
<p>『Sure thing.』</p>
<p>Fran puts the phantom sword she was using back into her dimensional storage. She could tell at a glance that she wouldn’t be able to beat the legendary skeleton lest she gave it her all.</p>
<p>She grabs ahold of me and takes up a stance, a situation that makes me feel much more natural.</p>
<p>「Nn. Much more natural with Master.」</p>
<p>『Hahahaha!』</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>『Nothing, don’t mind it. There’s no way we can lose if the two of us work together, right?』</p>
<p>「Of course.」</p>
<p>『Alright! This’ll be the first hard fight we’ve had in awhile. Let’s do this!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>TL Note: Divine (Weapon) Arts/Techniques are not necessarily of the holy element. It simply means something along the lines of “Sword Saint,” but “Spear Saint” sounds awkward, so I’ve decided to standardize them as Divine Arts. Please let me know if you believe this to be an issue and if you have any suggestions for improvement.</p>
<p>TL Note 2: I’ve been using the word Spirit. It’s important to note that these refer specifically to spirits of the dead as opposed to a race of spiritual beings. I’ve attempted to imply this through the connotations. Please let me know if there’s anything better for me to change this to going forward.</p>
<p>TL Note 3: Wolfy -&gt; Urushi again. A certain individual pointed out the author's intent. Props to them.</p>

		<p>75. Overwhelming Power.</p>
<p>A violent ringing filled the room as Fran and the skeleton exchanged blows. Blade against blade, the two continued to clash.<span id="more-53"></span></p>
<p>The battle was rather simple and barebones, but if anyone were to have watched it, they undoubtedly would have ended up staring in wonderment, for the duel almost seemed to be one of an inhuman calibur.</p>
<p>From a pure numerical standpoint, Fran was at an overwhelming disadvantage. Her stats were much lower, and the two were about equally proficient in swordplay. Luckily, I was able to bring her up to par by raising her abilities with my skills and spells.</p>
<p>And so, we were stuck at a stalemate.</p>
<p>The most annoying part of it all was that the skeleton was capable of appraisal jamming. I wasn't able to figure out where it’s magic stone was, so I had to guess. Thanks to that, I wasn't able to catch it off guard with a sudden telekinetic catapult. Though, I guess I did always have the option of just using it over and over again until I hit the right spot.</p>
<p>『It’s healing again!』</p>
<p>「Haa!」</p>
<p>「Kakaka! (Skeleton noises)」</p>
<p>Another aspect that brought us trouble was the Skeleton’s Dungeon Guardian title, as it provided rapid recovery to both its HP and MP so long as it remained within the dungeon.</p>
<p>Seriously? God damn, dealing with something with the ability to regenerate <i>this</i> much is a huge pain in the ass… On second thought, telekinetic catapult might not be the best idea, as using it would revealing it, which in turn could potentially allow the skeleton to react to it when we need it the most. Our only choice was to slowly and steadily whittle him down.</p>
<p>Another thing that gave us trouble was that one autocast skill it had. The skill did exactly what its name implied, and continued to bombard us with magical projectiles. And since it was automatic, it would continue to function regardless of what the skeleton itself was doing. It would often end up getting in our way the moment we got it into any sort of favourable position. The spells it fires off are pretty powerful too, so our HP tends to take a nosedive every time we get hit.</p>
<p>We were able to fight back by putting points into magical barriers. Through their use, we managed to not only nullify the spells automatically cast by the skeleton, but also some of its other attacks as well, a welcome miscalculation.</p>
<p>The tradeoff was that a decent chunk my precious self evolution points ended up getting used up in the process.</p>
<p>「Haaaa!」</p>
<p>「Kakakaka!」</p>
<p>Ring!</p>
<p>The duel continued for over ten minutes.</p>
<p>Ring ring!</p>
<p>The sound made by the clash of steel on steel was occasionally drowned out by the ringing of a glass bell. Each ring was accompanied by an activation of the Black Cat Armour set’s instant death prevention passive. In other words, the skeleton’s magic sword, Deathgaze, must’ve had some sort of instant kill ability, but it was negated through and through.</p>
<p>Thank you Gallus! I’ll definitely treat you to a good drink or two once we meet up in Ulmut!</p>
<p>Even with the anti-instant-kill passive, Fran was still at a disadvantage. The enemy we were facing off against was a member of an undead, a walking corpse that knew not of fatigue or exhaustion. Fran, on the other hand, would suffer from its effects. The longer we fought, the bigger a toll would be taken on both her body and mind. That said, the ten odd minutes this exchange had lasted had not been spent in vain.</p>
<p>『It’s magic stone is probably somewhere in its head.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>I’d left all the fighting to Fran whilst instead spending my time observing the skeleton and searching for its magic stone.</p>
<p>Since it had no sense of pain and could regenerate rapidly, the skeleton straight up tanked most of our attacks. The only exception was when we targeted its head; it would always defend against anything aimed towards its cranium.</p>
<p>『Looks like it’s invulnerabilities ended up giving us a hand!』</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Kakakakakakakaka!」</p>
<p>That said, it wasn’t going to just let us attack its sole vital point.</p>
<p>Our knowledge of that point, however, caused the battle’s intensity to suddenly rise to a whole new level. Fran focused the entirety of her assault on the skeleton’s head while the skeleton defended against her attacks and concentrated on countering them.</p>
<p>「Ha!」</p>
<p>「Kaka!」</p>
<p>「There!」</p>
<p>「Kakkaka!」</p>
<p>The skeleton focused every last bit of its attention on Fran’s attacks, a fatal mistake.</p>
<p>『Urushi!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Ka!?」</p>
<p>Urushi hadn’t been able to provide much support due to how quickly and erratically the two melee fighters had been moving about, so instead of focusing on long ranged bombardment, he ended up sneaking into Fran’s shadow. There, he waited until the most opportune moment: now.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

        </div>
        
<p>He extended his head out from within the shadows and grabbed ahold of the skeleton’s leg.</p>
<p>「Master! Now!」</p>
<p>『Here we go!』</p>
<p>I finally reveal my trump card and launch myself with a telekinetic catapult from point blank range.</p>
<p>『Oryaaaa!』</p>
<p>It didn’t matter how strong it was or how fast it reacted. The skeleton wouldn’t be able to dodge the attack; it was done for — or at least it should’ve been.</p>
<p>「Kakakaaaa!」</p>
<p>Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine!</p>
<p>「Kya!」</p>
<p>「Whimper.」</p>
<p>『Wha-!』</p>
<p>Light erupted from the skeleton’s body and blew us back just as we were about to emerge victorious. What a tremendous amount of magical energy!</p>
<p>I quickly scanned our surroundings in order to figure out exactly what was going on; the skeleton was already on the move.</p>
<p>「Kakakakakakakaka!」</p>
<p>「Ua!」</p>
<p>『Fran!』</p>
<p>The skeleton moved so quickly that it almost seemed to vanish on the spot. Before I knew it, it’d already ran up to Fran, who had yet to recover from the last attack she received. She quickly drew her phantom blade, but the skeleton knocked it out of her hands with but a single strike.</p>
<p>I quickly started moving towards her right as the skeleton began to swing it’s blade once more. The weapon moved with an incredible speed. I didn't know if I could make it in time.</p>
<p>『Uraaaaaaa!!!』</p>
<p>The sound of steel on steel echoed throughout the room yet again</p>
<p>I managed to force my way between them at the very last moment. I didn’t have enough power to fully deflect the blow, and I was sent flying yet again. Luckily though, I was able to buy Fran enough time to get back up.</p>
<p>『You still okay?』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>The skeleton continues to attack, but Fran manages to grab ahold of me and defend.</p>
<p>「Kaka! Kakaka!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>「Ka!」</p>
<p>「Ua!」</p>
<p>『Middle Heal!』</p>
<p>God damn! Fran’s started to get pushed back. She’s been taking more damage than I can heal, and all that damage has been piling up. All the magical barriers I have to keep casting have also taken their toll on my mana. Why did this god damn skeleton suddenly power up so much!?<br>

<p>What the shit!? All it stats rose by 500? Seriously? It’s strength, vitality, magic power and dexterity are all over a thousand too. What the hell! Talk about overpowered bullshit!</p>
<p>Its current state says that it has its latent potential unlocked too. That’s probably because of that Latent Potential Release skill it’s got. Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>Latent Potential Release: Unlocks the user’s latent potential. Gains stats based on how much room the user has to grow. Since it pushes the user to its limits, this skill will drain the user’s life force throughout its activation. The user is also required to provide some sort of compensation. Compensation will vary from user to user.</p>
<p>Now that I take a second look, I realize that the skeleton’s HP is plummeting at an incredible rate. That’s nice and all, but with the way things are going, Fran will probably collapse before the skeleton actually manages to use its remaining hp.</p>
<p>「Kakaka!」</p>
<p>「Ugh!」</p>
<p>Shit! Why the hell is it so strong! I have to use Telekenesis every time it attacks just to stop myself from flying out of Fran’s hands.</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Kaka!」</p>
<p>「Whimper!」</p>
<p>It’s reaction speed seems to have risen as well. Urushi was cut down the moment he emerged from Fran’s shadow and attempted to attack.</p>
<p>『Urushi, fall back!』</p>
<p>「W-Woof.」</p>
<p>Urushi musters up whatever strength he can and dives back into Fran’s shadow. Thankfully, the skeleton’s attacks aren’t able to follow it there.</p>
<p>「Reverse Undead!」</p>
<p>Jean’s voice rings throughout the room right as the skeleton’s blade passes through where Urushi had been just a moment before. The spell he cast was one with a powerful effect; it could completely obliterate undead creatures. It should be even capable of turning high tier undead into nothing but dust.</p>
<p>But it failed.</p>
<p>「Curses, it is as I feared. My magic has no effect.」</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Kakakakakakaka!」</p>
<p>Fran and the skeleton continued to exchange blows, but her HP was still dropping much faster than the undead's. It was gradually but steadily driving us into a corner.</p>

    < /br>

        
		<p>76. On the Edge</p>
<p>The Legendary Skeleton had become overwhelmingly powerful after releasing its latent potential.</p>
<p>It delivered strike after strike, each with all the power and technique of a master swordsman. Its movements were so fast that it was near impossible to keep track of. Even the spells it automatically fired off from time to time had been powered up. Not even my max leveled magic barriers could stop them anymore.<span id="more-58"></span></p>
<p>Urushi had already long been defeated, and Jean’s magic simply didn’t work on it. It was just far too powerful.</p>
<p>「Ha!」</p>
<p>「Ka!」</p>
<p>Fran’s being pressured to the point where she can no longer do anything but defend. Her HP continued to drop as the skeleton attacked with a storm-like assault. It’s goal was obviously to end her before it exhausted all its strength.</p>
<p>Fran managed to dodge each fatal strike by the only the slightest bit. The situation didn’t look good for her, but, she didn’t give up. Her eyes almost seemed to glimmer as she searched for an opportunity to take back the momentum.</p>
<p>『You should probably use Skill Taker.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>To be honest, I wanted to save it a bit more so we could use it on whatever bosses lay in wait for us after this one, but, it didn’t seem like we really had any other choice. Using it now isn't all that detrimental though, seeing as how Fran and I can both use the skill once each. Besides, we’ve got a trump card up ours sleeves anyways.</p>
<p>That said, I didn’t even really know whether or not skill taker would work. I even had to muddle over which skill to steal. Latent Potential Release might not deactivate even if we steal it, but stealing a different skill would allow him to keep his current stats regardless, so I didn’t have much of a choice but to at least give it a shot.</p>
<p>『Use it now!』</p>
<p>「Ha!」</p>
<p>「Ka?」</p>
<p>Fran activates Skill Taker and targets the skeleton’s Latent Potential Release. Hopefully this’ll drop its stats back down to what they normally are….</p>
<p>〈Skill Taker’s current target cannot be stolen. Process Failed.〉</p>
<p>Wait, what the hell!?</p>
<p>Skill Taker’s effect is as follows: Skill Taker: Lv Max. Steals rarity level 10 and below skills with a success rate of 100%. Can be used once per target. Cooldown: 18 days. Range: Skill level * 1 meter.</p>
<p>We’re still in the midst of a melee, so there’s no way the skeleton’s out of range. Latent Potential Release doesn’t have a level either, so that shouldn’t be the issue, which means that the skill’s rarity has to be at least 11. Shit, seriously!? Or wait, is it because it’s classified as an extra skill? Is it possible that we can’t steal those?</p>
<p>「Kakkaka!」</p>
<p>「Ku… The skill…?」</p>
<p>『It failed!』</p>
<p>「Again.」</p>
<p>Fran tries to use the skill again.</p>
<p>「…Can’t!」</p>
<p>But she wasn’t able to. It seemed that failing to take a skill also consumed one of the skill’s usages. Fran won’t be able to use skill taker for another 18 days!</p>
<p>I could always try using mine…but it’d probably be better to change up our strategy a little. It was time for me to pull out my trump card!</p>
<p>『Fran, I’m going to do <i>that</i>』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>I start putting points into the Divine Sword Art skill and raised it all the way to Lv 5 in one go. It was a trick was one that Fran and I thought up whilst journeying through the dungeon. Its purpose was to catch the enemy off guard, and to that end, we purposefully left it at Lv 5 instead of pointing it all the way. That way, we'd be able to use the exact same trick in the future as well.</p>
<p>「Kaka?」</p>
<p>「Ha!」</p>
<p>「Ka-Kaka!?」</p>
<p>Fran’s movements undergo a visible change as her knowledge of blade deepens. Every step she takes, every motion she executes becomes much more precise. Just a moment prior, the two were swordsmen on par with each other. But, Fran had easily surpassed the skeleton in a matter of moments.</p>
<p>Based on what we’ve experienced, a three skill level difference would lead to an gap in strength too wide to be crossed. The reason we chose to boost the skill’s level by four was to make up for the difference in stats. That said, the skeleton still had the advantage. It felt no fatigue, and its body was effectively immortal.</p>
<p>However, the sudden change in Fran’s abilities threw it off and momentarily dulled its movements.</p>
<p>And thus, we were given one last chance.</p>
<p>「Haaaa!!!」</p>
<p>Fran activated Impact Slash, a Lv 1 divine sword technique. Though the skill had a bit of a recovery delay after it, it was still an impressive one, a full forced right to left horizontal cut packed with nothing but pure power. The two of us worked together to combine her Magical Convergence and my Sorcery so that we could cloak the strike with a Wind Blade Overboost. The attack was truly one with every last fibre of our beings behind it; it was several times more powerful than anything else we’d ever done in the past.</p>

</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>But even so, the skeleton still managed to deflect it. What monstrous strength!</p>
<p>Its arms were fast. At this rate, it’d be able to get a hit in before us. We’d be in trouble.</p>
<p>Or at least that’s how things would've been.</p>
<p>『We weren’t thinking of finishing you off with just that one hit either!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『Sorry about this, Fran.』</p>
<p>「Doesn’t matter.」</p>
<p>Impact Slash would normally end with an opening because the user would have to twist their hips a full ninety degrees whilst delivering the swing.</p>
<p>But I forced the skill to end a bit earlier than usual by stockpiling and then suddenly releasing a bunch of telekinetic force. This allowed us to cancel the technique’s post-cast delay, at the cost of sending all the force and shock right back up Fran’s arms.</p>
<p>And the result?</p>
<p>A series of loud cracks resounded throughout the boss room.</p>
<p>Fran’s arms broke, and her muscle fibres were torn to shreds. The noises that accompanied the event made me feel discomfort, and the thought it was my own fault even more so.</p>
<p>But even despite Fran's current condition, we still needed to deliver the finishing blow.</p>
<p>『Frannn!』</p>
<p>「Urahhh!」</p>
<p>Though her arms were screaming in agony, Fran managed to activate Snake Slash, a Lv 1 sword art. Though I could hear her arms breaking as she thrusted the blade, I boosted the attack’s speed with telekinesis. We couldn't afford to hold anything back, even the slightest bit.</p>
<p>Impact slash had thrown the skeleton off completely, it had yet to right its stance.</p>
<p>「Aaaaahhhh!」</p>
<p>「Kakka!」</p>
<p>The hell!? Even though we’d managed to completely mess up the skeleton’s posture, it was still able to react in time by tilting its head backwards. Shit! I’m not going to make it!</p>
<p>Damn it, what do I do? Is there any way for me to…. Wait! Yes! I know exactly what to do!</p>
<p>『Here we gooooo! Shapeshift!!』</p>
<p>I thin my blade in order to elongate it by approximately 20cm. My form becomes less like that of a longsword and warps into something akin to a long estoc. The process cost me a whole 200 mana, but it was well worth it. I’m really grateful I managed to get my hands on this skill!</p>
<p>「Ka!!」</p>
<p>The skeleton’s completely run out of options. I flew straight through it's skull and split it's magic stone in two.</p>
<p>「Ka… Ka」</p>
<p>The legendary skeleton finally stops moving.</p>
<p>「Kakakakakaaa」</p>
<p>And then, it laughed. It laughed an ominous, unsettling cackle as its body collapsed underneath itself. The crimson skeleton crumbled into not but a pile of bone, as if all its prior actions had been nothing more than an illusion.</p>
<p>But even then, it still gave off a ghostly impression, as if it could rise up again at any given moment. As expected of a B level threat.</p>
<p>「Ugh….」</p>
<p>『Alright, I’ll fix you right now, Fran. Greater Heal!』</p>
<p>「Are you all alright?」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>It was a tough battle, but, winning it paid off. the skeleton’s magic stone was worth over three hundred magic stone points, and I managed to get ahold of it's appraisal jamming, spirit control, and magic resist, amongst many other useful skills.</p>
<p>We should be able to save Latent Potential Release for whenever we need a trump card.</p>
<p>The skill’s effect is supposed to change based on the user, so I’m kind of curious how much it’ll have an effect on Fran and I. I wish we could test it right now, but it costs HP, has a few other requirements and even has a 24 hour cooldown, so I’ll have to just hang on to it for now.</p>
<p>「I’m…fine.」</p>
<p>『Are you sure? Does it hurt anywhere?』</p>
<p>「Nn. Fine.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof?」</p>
<p>Urushi licks Fran’s arms. He also seems to be concerned about her as well.</p>
<p>「Thanks.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Jean went to go retrieve the skeleton’s bones.</p>
<p>『Can you use those for anything?』</p>
<p>「These bones hold great value for use as a catalyst in the practice of necromancy. They alone more than make up for every last bit of this expedition’s cost. Hahahaha! I thank you greatly.」</p>
<p>『I guess that means you can use potions and the like as freely as you want now.』</p>
<p>「Whatever did you plan to do with the skeleton’s equipment?」</p>
<p>『I don’t know. Didn’t think about it yet.』</p>
<p>「I’ve no need for its sword or cloak, so I shall pass these two items to you. That said, I would very much like to keep ahold of the armour, orihalcum is a material that mages like myself find to be quite useful after all.」</p>
<p>『Sounds good to me. You sure though?』</p>
<p>Jean was the one who made the request for us to come along in the first place. I wouldn’t have minded even if he decided to take all the loot for himself. I was quite grateful that he was willing to split it with us though.</p>

    < /br>

        
		<p>77 The Phantom King</p>
<p>Thirty minutes had passed since we defeated the Legendary Skeleton, but we were still sitting around in its room. Fran and Jean were restoring their MP through potions, but I was stuck waiting for mine to naturally regenerate.<span id="more-62"></span></p>
<p>I was still far from ready to explore despite the fact that we’d already rested up quite a decent bit. My durability was at half, and I had less than 500 MP remaining.</p>
<p>Fran’s armour had almost been completely torn to shreds, so Jean summoned a skeleton to repair it. He was so prepared for any given situation that he even had the necessary magic crystal on hand.</p>
<p>I decided to use this time to inspect a few of the skills I gained throughout the dungeon’s exploration.</p>
<p>The ones I looked at first were the ones I got from the Legendary Skeleton. Specifically, I focused on Appraisal Jamming and Autocast before looking into three of the skills I got from other parts of the dungeon, namely, Mana Emission, Physical Barrier, Herculean Strength. All five of these skills were currently Lv 1.</p>
<p>The first skill I tried to use was naturally Appraisal Jamming. And as I expected, the skill's functions seemed relatively limited because it was still stuck at Lv 1. Like other informatic-type skills, it wouldn’t be able to prove itself useful unless I pointed it.</p>
<p>The spells Autocast were pretty weak too. A kid could do the same amount of damage if they just chucked a pebble at something. Yeah, I don’t really know what I expected from a Lv 1 skill.</p>
<p>Mana emission did exactly what it said it did, and allowed me to emit magical energy. I could use it for both offense and defense by either firing it off like I would a bullet or spreading it around me like I would a barrier. It was a great skill, but again, it wasn’t really able to do all that much at Lv 1.</p>
<p>Physical Barrier was pretty much the same as one of the skills I already had, Magical Barrier. The only difference was that the former had better defense against physical attacks, whereas the latter had better defense against magic.</p>
<p>The Herculean Strength skill was an active buff. It would temporarily increase the user’s strength upon use. I’m not really sure what to feel about the numbers though, they seemed kind of pathetic. The Lv 1 version would only raise the stat by 2 for 10 minutes, but I am kind of curious as to what would happen if I pointed it.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, none of the skills I gained would really help us much in a fight, Latent Potential Release aside, that is.</p>
<p>I didn't mind though. All the skirmishes and boss battles we’ve experienced throughout the dungeon have allowed Fran and Urushi to level up 10 and 15 times respectively. Those level ups alone have more than increased our combat prowess by more than enough.</p>
<p>「Nom nom.」</p>
<p>「Chomp Chomp.」</p>
<p>「Splendid, another meal as delectable as could be.」</p>
<p>Fran, Urushi and Jean ate as we rested. The three were all greedily shoving pieces of my special fried chicken down their throats, though I guess it’d be called fried monster instead, seeing as how it was made out of meat harvested from a variety of magic beasts instead of well, you know, chicken. It seemed that fried foods were exceptionally difficult to come by, and now that I think about it, I can’t seem to recall ever seeing anyone ever bread anything before frying it – though I have seen people dumping food in piping hot oil before. The fried foods I made were apparently so uncommon that they even caught Jean by surprise.</p>
<p>Urushi was especially overjoyed. He got way more than usual because both Fran and Jean continued to pass him bones as they finished with their meat.</p>
<p>「Hmm… it appears as if Fly’s discovered another door. Hahahaha! And this time, he’s found the dungeon core behind it!」</p>
<p>「Boss?」</p>
<p>「Allow me just a moment to answer that question for you.」</p>
<p>Jean pauses.</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>『What’s wrong?』</p>
<p>「I’ve lost Fly’s signal.」</p>
<p>「Killed?」</p>
<p>「It appears so, but he’s already informed me of the path we should follow. And so, I shall take the lead.」</p>
<p>The monsters on the dungeon’s tenth floor were pretty much exactly the same as the ones on the ninth, but we had an easier time dealing with them. We knew that we were about to finish the dungeon, so we started pushing forward with renewed vigour whilst also using our items more generously.</p>
<p>「Behold, companions of mine! That door right there is what marks the boss’ room.」</p>
<p>We finally managed to reach the dungeon’s last boss after three entire days worth of exploration.</p>
<p>I absorbed quite a few magic stones during all the skirmishing we did on our way here, so I managed to recover almost all my durability alongside 2000 or so MP.</p>
<p>Fran’s movements have gone up a notch as well. The fight with the Legendary Skeleton had provided her with quite a bit of combat experience.</p>
<p>But despite our improvements, we continued to keep our guards up.</p>
<p>「Boss?」</p>
<p>「Fly was not able to provide us any information, but there is simply no way the room would be left unguarded.」</p>
<p>『The dungeon master’s probably in the core room as well.』</p>
<p>The dungeon master might turn out to be something pretty powerful given the scale of the dungeon he’s managed to create. He’s even able to order B ranked magic beasts around, so we know for sure that he can’t just be some random pushover.</p>
<p>「I require some time to prepare.」</p>
<p>『Prepare what?』</p>
<p>「Wahahahahaha! I’m glad you asked. The answer is of course, my trump card. Its incurs quite the cost, so I wished to avoid its application whenever possible. However, the current state of affairs calls for me to prepare for the worst.」</p>
<p>Jean was right. We needed to do everything in our power to ready ourselves for the battle ahead…except I didn’t know what or how to prepare.</p>
<p>「Raise skills?」</p>
<p>『That’s one thing I was considering…』</p>
<p>I still had 25 self evolution points remaining, but I had to make sure I used them wisely.</p>
<p>『I think it’d be better for me to save them for now so I can point whatever we end up needing to beat the boss.』</p>
<p>The floor boss had to be at least a threat level B, and we didn’t have the slightest clue as to what we were up against. Pointing stuff right now might end up screwing us over instead of doing us any good.</p>
<p>「Fran, Master, I would like to request that you retrieve a few of the items I left within your dimensional storages.」</p>
<p>『Which ones?』</p>
<p>「The first I would like to retrieve would be the pendant.」</p>
<p>The pendant? Oh yeah, there was something like that wasn’t there?</p>
<p>「This?」</p>
<p>「Precisely. I’d like to you wear it.」</p>
<p>What the hell? Whoever made that thing has to have some issues, I swear. There’s an incredibly realistic zombie face plastered onto the pendant.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>「That pendant functions to protect the user in the case they take a fatal blow.」</p>
<p>『Seriously?』</p>
<p>It totally looks like the type of item you’d use to curse someone or summon a zombie or something like that.</p>
<p>「Hahaha! Your doubts are well placed. I made the same mistake in the past, and only purchased the item because I’d assumed it would have some use in necromancy.」</p>
<p>『Well, yeah. I mean it’s literally a zombie head on a pendant.』</p>
<p>「It’s effect is quite incredible regardless though, is it not?」</p>
<p>The pendant would stop the user from dying once whilst restoring both their HP and MP back up to half. The latter half of the effect was impressive, and evidenced that the pendant was a pretty expensive item. Other, similar items would often just leave the user with a single point of HP.</p>
<p>『Well, if you’re sure you don’t mind, we gratefully accept.』</p>
<p>「No problem. That aside, I would also like you to retrieve several other items as well.」</p>
<p>「Which?」</p>
<p>「Most of the amulets. I would prefer that you wear them as well, in fact.」</p>
<p>Fran ended up getting about 10 different magical amulets. I couldn’t really feel much magical energy emanating from them, but they were still pretty nice to have for the sake of peace of mind.</p>
<p>「And with that out of the way, I too must prepare myself for battle.」</p>
<p>We bring out a bunch of different tools and medicines as per Jean’s request.</p>
<p>One of the items he picked was a large, rectangular box. Inside of it was a sinister looking, spine shaped staff topped off by a skull. It suited Jean pretty well because of how ominous he looked, and really amplified that necromancer vibe he had going for him.</p>
<p>I quickly sweeped over the staff and appraised it.</p>
<p>Name: Unknown</p>
<p>Huh, doesn’t seem like I can appraise it.</p>
<p>「Hahahahaha! This staff is a bit special. You will require more than a merely the appraisal skill to see its worth.」</p>
<p>「Why?」</p>
<p>「Its name is Aidoneus’ Blessing, a named item I happened to procure in a dungeon during one of my adventures.」</p>
<p>It seemed that the staff’s stats were so high that I’d need some sort of upgraded or special appraisal skill to be able to see through it.</p>
<p>『It’s ability is t-』</p>
<p>「Kukakakakakakaka!」</p>
<p>『Wha-!!』</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>What was that? It sounded like a human laugh, and at first I thought it came from the staff, but Jean seemed surprised as well, so that can't be right.</p>
<p>「Kukakakaka!」</p>
<p>The laugh was strangely irritating too. Just hearing it was enough to annoy me.</p>
<p>I quickly began scanning the room for the voice's source.</p>
<p>And that was when the situation took a sudden turn for the worse.</p>
<p>A loud "shing" resounded through the corridor, accompanied by a bright, glowing light.</p>
<p>『A magic circle?!』</p>
<p>My crisis sense started to go off as a magic circle appeared within the hallway.</p>
<p>Shit!</p>
<p>『Fran, Urushi!』</p>
<p>Fuck, it doesn't look like we're going to be able to avoid it.</p>
<p>The magic circle began to expand. It only took a few seconds for it to grow to the point where it filled the entire corridor with blinding light.</p>
<p>「You’ve kept me waiting for far too long. If you won’t come, then I’ll just bring you right to me! Kukakakakaka!」</p>
<p>Our surroundings had completely changed by the time the light had disappeared. We were now standing within a large room, several times larger than any other we’ve come across in the dungeon thus far. But despite that, all our gazes were focused but on a single target.</p>
<p>Or rather, we had no choice but to direct our attention straight ahead. We simply didn’t have the liberty to pick any other option.</p>
<p>「Kuakakaka! Welcome, intruders of mine.」</p>
<p>The figure that stood before us was emanating an overwhelming amount of magical energy. His very existence seemed to lay ridiculous pressure upon us, but most importantly, he was implausibly revolting to gaze upon.</p>
<p>His threat level was estimated to be a B, but I simply couldn’t see him as something that stood shoulder to shoulder with the Legendary Skeleton we defeated earlier. He was so powerful that I probably would’ve shat myself if I wasn’t a sword.</p>
<p>The colour drained from Fran’s face as she tightened her grip on my handle. She was able to stand up to a demon without so much as even flinching, but the being before us was so intimidating that she had started to tremble in fear.</p>
<p>.<br>
『Don’t worry, Fran.』</p>
<p>Seeing Fran like that calmed me down in an instant. Why the hell was I getting all panicked? I couldn’t let myself get carried away, I still had to protect her. For the time being, I decided to consider our escape options. We could still use the Warp Feather if it really came down to it.</p>
<p>『We’re going to be making a break for it, Fran.』</p>
<p>（Understood.）</p>
<p>『Jean, let’s get the hell out of here.』</p>
<p>「Hold that thought for just a moment.」</p>
<p>Fran had already grabbed ahold of Jean’s arm, and I had already readied the Warp Feather. There wasn’t any way in hell we’d be able to fight the monster standing before us.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>『The hell!?』</p>
<p>The Warp Feather refused to activate. I didn’t know what happened, nor did I know what to say. I should’ve had more than enough magical power.</p>
<p>「Kukakaka! Unfortunately for you, this room was designed to prevent escape through teleportation. You have no choice but to fight me to the death! Kukakaka! Kukakakakakakaka!」</p>
<p>The monster, the lich standing before us laughed joyously as he announced a cruel declaration.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p>Translator here, got a few things to say.</p>
<p>Firstly, this chapter effectively wraps up my initial burst. From now on, I'll be translating at a more sustainable pace. 1 or 2 chapters per week is my current estimate, but this is subject to change based on how busy I end up being.</p>
<p>Secondly, the translations can get pretty far from literal. There are some places that the Japanese doesn't work that well in English, so I end up splitting things up and even occasionally adding in an extra line or two here and there. I occasionally cut a bit of stuff out too. The only thing I really work towards retaining is a scene's undertone. My opinion is that LN/WN are the only medium that truly allows for this, as screwing around with the lines can mess up Manga and VN pretty hard. What I mean to say is, if you're confused as to why something was translated a certain way, feel free to hit me up and ask. I don't mind making things even less literal for the sake of flow and shit, so feel free to throw suggestions too.</p>
<p>Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a date with US border control. 〣( ºΔº )〣</p>

		<p><b>78. Vs Lich</b></p>
<p><b><br>
</b>As the light faded away, it left behind it nothing but a single undead creature. The sheer amount of magical energy that emanated from its body made me feel as if I was getting goosebumps. What stood before us was the most powerful undead known to man. A lich.<span id="more-67"></span></p>

<p>The Lich species was one whose name was spread far and wide, and for good reason. They were far more powerful than any other species of undead.</p>
<p>Looking at its stats confused me a bit though. Is that really all it’s got? It’d seemed so intimidating and had so much pressure that I’d almost wanted to classify it as an A ranked threat. I mean, I know that every lich is going to be a bit different, but this guy here, his status seems to show that he's only a B ranked threat at best.</p>
<p>「Overload: Summon Undead」</p>
<p>The lich started summoning undead before we were able to fully recover from the shock of being unable to port out.</p>
<p>「Why don’t you face off against these first? Kukakaka! Don’t die too easily now.」</p>
<p>「OoooooOoooOooOOOOoo…」<br>
「Ahhhhhhh…」<br>
「Graaoooooo…」</p>
<p>The lich simultaneously summoned 10 powerful undead creatures. Even the weakest amongst them was ranked C; half were strong enough to be classified as B level threats. They were just as powerful as the legendary skeleton we had just struggled to defeat just a bit earlier in the day.</p>
<p>『Fran』</p>
<p>「Nn. Ready to go all out.」</p>
<p>We focused our magical energies as we readied ourselves for a battle to the death. We would have to thin out their numbers with magic whilst hoping for an opening with which we could attack the lich.</p>
<p>Or at least that’s what I’d planned before I noticed Jean stepping up in front of us.</p>
<p>「Leave this to me.」</p>
<p>『You sure…?』</p>
<p>「Absolutely. I shall not fall to the likes of mere pawns so long as I have my staff.」</p>
<p>Jean’s face was plastered with his usual, brazen smile, but I couldn’t help but feel as if he seemed a bit more grim and resolute than usual.</p>
<p>「Hahahaha! Behold, my trump card!」</p>
<p>Jean rises to face the incoming undead head on.</p>
<p>「Aidoneus’ Blessing, commence activation!」</p>
<p>The skull atop the staff almost seems to react to his words; its jaw dropped open with a click, and its eyes seemed to gain a sort of dubious lustre.</p>
<p>「OOOOOOOOOooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooOOOOOOoOOoooo」</p>
<p>『The hell?!』</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「Woof…」</p>
<p>A sort of half-hymn half-moan emerges from within the skull. It was hard to describe; it sounded mysterious, creepy, and a bit like a grudgeful prayer all at the same time.</p>
<p>It was quite a strange thing to hear.</p>
<p>「OOOOOoooooOOoooo」</p>
<p>「Aidoneus’ Blessing, grant peace to those unable to achieve salvation. Sing them a melody of love, hate, and resentment!」</p>
<p>A blueish-white light flowed out from within the staff.</p>
<p>「Escape, companions! Escape the light!」</p>
<p>The undead attempted to follow the lich’s orders, but there wasn’t any way for them to leave the room. They were eventually caught by the staff’s brilliance.</p>
<p>And when the light finally faded, the summoned undead followed and disappeared back into nothingness.</p>
<p>『Eh?』</p>
<p>「Amazing.」</p>
<p>「It took you only an instant to rid me of my companions?! Kuakakakakaa!! What was that?!」</p>
<p>「The last line you uttered is one that I would like to return to you.」</p>
<p>「And what exactly is that supposed to mean?」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! This staff is a divine artifact that possesses the ability to cause any and every sort of undead to ascend to the heavens. And so, by that logic, you too should have been influenced by its effects. Why exactly are you still here?」</p>
<p>Jean coughed out clot after clot of blood as he spoke. His face had paled to the point where he himself almost looked like he’d already become a member of the undead.</p>
<p>『Jean!』</p>
<p>「Here. Shoulder.」</p>
<p>「Thank you kindly.」</p>
<p>「Kukakaka! I see now. The item you possess allows you to use a high level, area of effect purification spell by consuming your own life force. It looks like getting rid of all those high level undead did quite the number on you! Kukakaka!」</p>
<p>Damn, Jean must’ve completely exhausted himself. Casting ascension on Andy alone was already enough to make him feel pretty tired. The spell he just cast probably probably drained him of everything he had. It might’ve even cut into his life span.</p>
<p>『I’ll heal you r-』</p>
<p>「Do not bother. The damage I sustained comes not from injuries but rather plain exhaustion.」</p>
<p>「This then.」</p>
<p>「Thank you.」</p>
<p>Fran pulls out a stamina potion and hands it over to Jean. Stamina potions were a bit special in the sense that they didn’t recover HP, but instead directly targeted and recovered one’s life force.</p>
<p>「So what will your next move be? It appeared as if your trump card had no effect on me.」</p>
<p>Why did it have no effect anyways? The staff was supposed to get rid of all undead unconditionally. He shouldn’t be fine. Is he not an undead? No, that’s not possible, his status says that he’s a lich.</p>
<p>「As powerful as it may be, that tool of yours has no effect on a being of my calibur!」</p>
<p>That might in fact be true. Liches are practically thought of as kings amongst the undead. There’s always the possibility of the item not working simply because they’re in a class of their own.</p>
<p>「Kuhahaha! Tell me, how does despair feel?」</p>

        </div>
        
<p>The lich continued its incessant verbal assault, but it had little effect. We were far from hopeless.</p>
<p>「We cut him, we win.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, that’s the way!』</p>
<p>Fran closes the gap between her and the lich and disallows him the chance to summon anymore undead.</p>
<p>「Ha!」</p>
<p>「Kukakakaka! How pointless!」</p>
<p>What? The sword’s just passing through him? None of his skills were supposed to do anything like that…</p>
<p>「Raah!」</p>
<p>『Fire Arrow!』</p>
<p>Fran tried to use an elemental blade attack while I tried to use magic, but neither had any sort of effect. Both passed right through him, just like initial slash. At first, I thought that the lich was just an illusion or something, but that’s impossible given that he’s already used magic. And on top of that, he even counterattacked the moment our strikes passed right through him.</p>
<p>「Gah!」</p>
<p>『Middle Heal』</p>
<p>All he did was throw a single punch, but that was enough to halve Fran’s HP. He was definitely more than just an illusion.</p>
<p>Wait, how did he do that much damage with only 134 STR? He’s supposed to be weak as hell, and it’s not like he used any skills or magic either. How the hell did he manage to chunk Fran so badly?</p>
<p>『There’s got to be some sort of trick to this.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Strong.」</p>
<p>There has to be something in his status page that I’m missing. Or actually, his status page could be wrong altogether. Everything would totally check out if he had some type of appraisal jamming skill.</p>
<p>『What a pain in the ass.』</p>
<p>（What now?）</p>
<p>『He’s definiately using some sort of trick to phaze through our attacks, so we might be able to steal it from him if we use Skill Taker, but…』</p>
<p>I can’t really affirm the specifics because Appraisal isn’t working properly.</p>
<p>『Jean, have you tried that skill of yours?』</p>
<p>（It does not work. Soul Seeing eyes has no effect on the undead.）</p>
<p>『Have you thought of any sort of strategy then?』</p>
<p>（I haven’t anything on the level of a strategy, but I would like the two of you to buy me a slight bit of time if possible.）</p>
<p>『Will buying you time let us beat this guy?』</p>
<p>（I cannot say for sure, but I would like you to trust me on this.）</p>
<p>Well, it seems like he’s got something up his sleeve. He isn’t all that confident about it, but we’re already grasping at straws here, so might as well go along with it.</p>
<p>（Got it.）</p>
<p>『We’ll end up stalling for you if we just fight it anyways, so why not.』</p>
<p>（You have my thanks.）</p>
<p>An hour passed.</p>
<p>We were still fighting against wave after wave of undead.</p>
<p>「What’s the matter? Are you tired already? You’re starting to get stiff.」</p>
<p>「Not… yet!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Splendid! How splendid! I cannot wait until I see the look on your face when all that hope takes a sudden turn and transforms into despair. You will make for fine undead! Kukakakaka!」</p>
<p>Our attacks have yet to show any effect on the lich. We’ve tried all sorts of things during our battle with the undead he summoned; we threw as many spells and attacks his way as we could, but each and every single one would just end up slipping right through him.</p>
<p>The only reason we were able to last this long in the first place was because he was just toying with us. He himself wouldn't do anything at all, and he even let Fran heal up when necessary.</p>
<p>It seems that he’s more interested in crushing our spirits and turning us into undead than defeating us – which makes sense. I’m pretty sure a necromancer as powerful as Jean could probably even end up turning into a Lich.</p>
<p>But thanks to that, we were able to buy Jean enough time to complete his preparations.</p>
<p>「Come on, why’d you stop moving? I’m going to summon even more undead at this rate.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi fired a Dark Lance at the lich, but as expected, it was to no avail.</p>
<p>「Yes, yes, exactly. You must keep attacking at all times. Now, why don’t you show me what it is you’ve been plotting this whole time?」</p>
<p>「Will definitely hit you.」</p>
<p>「Kukakakaka! Go ahead. If you can, that is.」</p>
<p>I was already down to about half my mana. The same applied to Fran, Urushi and Jean as well.</p>
<p>『Still not done yet, Jean?』</p>
<p>（Just a second longer! And for certain this time!）</p>
<p>After repeating a phrase he’s said time and time again, Jean finally reveals why he had us stall for time.</p>
<p>A loud explosion rings throughout the hall as it begins to shake with the intensity of a magnitude 5 earthquake. What the hell!? Did someone drop a bomb in the dungeon or something?!</p>
<p>「W-What in the world are you doing?!」</p>
<p>The lich’s usual, haughty attitude vanishes in an instant.</p>
<p>「It seems to have worked.」</p>
<p>「You did that?」</p>
<p>「T’was a subordinate of mine.」</p>
<p>It looked like what Jean was waiting for this whole time was for one of his subordinates to destroy something.</p>
<p>「T-The Phantom Flame is losing its magical power!? M-My forlorn desires, they’re disappearing!!? Arghhhhhhhhhh!!!!!」</p>
<p>『What’s happening to him?』</p>
<p>「He should be growing weaker as we speak. His strength stemmed from his ability to draw from the dungeon’s mana supply, and let us just say that I’ve arranged for it to be removed from right under his feet.」</p>
<p>『You should’ve just told us you were doing something like that.』</p>
<p>「My apologies. I would not have been able to destroy it lest you distracted the lich.」</p>
<p>「And?」</p>
<p>「Deceiving one’s allies is how one truly begins to deceive the enemy. I’ve no idea as to whether or not he possessed any sort of skill that would allow him to read minds, so I felt it better to hide it from you.」</p>
<p>「You bastard! You shall not be forgiven! I no longer have any need to turn the lot of you into subordinates! I’ll crush your limbs and have you tormented by the undead until you wish to have never been born! I refuse to let you know peace, even in death!!」</p>

    < /br>

        
		<p>79. Grudge</p>
<p>The destruction of his dungeon’s innards caused the lich to flare up in rage.</p>
<p>It was kind of weird. His face was well, literally just a skull, but I could still somehow tell he was angry.</p>
<p><span id="more-74"></span></p>
<p>『He’s probably got a few more openings now that he’s gotten weaker.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「What’s with that look on your face? Are you truly so foolish that you would even consider defeating me to be a possibility? Very well, I shall crush your hopes immediately. Use that appraisal skill of yours and behold.」</p>
<p>The lich’s status page warped as he deactivated a skill and allowed me to properly appraise him.<br>

<p>『Shit… Make sure you stay focused, Fran.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Mother fucker! Why the hell was he that strong?! We were too naive, god damn. He could probably kill us in just a split second if he really wanted to.</p>
<p>That said, him showing us his status page allowed us to see why our attacks weren’t actually hitting him.</p>
<p>（Master, I’ve come to understand why we were unable to deal him any damage. He’s using his space/time magic. Specifically, he’s likely using Dimension Shift.）</p>
<p>Dimension Shift seemed to be allowing him to temporarily move his body elsewhere. It was obviously a skill that ate up a huge amount of mana, so you normally wouldn’t be able to keep using it, especially consecutivity. The Lich, however, had the ability to completely nullify his incantations on top of a huge mana pool, so he could pretty much use it at will without experiencing any sort of drawback.</p>
<p>「Overload: Summon Undead」</p>
<p>The lich cast a spell and summoned a large number of undead. Unlike before, he wasn’t planning to just wait around and mess with us anymore; he promptly brought forth 10 different legendary skeletons, each armed with a formidable, magic weapon. Thankfully, none of them were able to release their latent potential, at least.</p>
<p>「Torture them to death!」</p>
<p>All ten immediately began rushing us. Though the number of undead summoned was actually less than it was before, each individual was of a higher quality, and they even seemed to be decently coordinated.</p>
<p>「Summon: Greater Undead」</p>
<p>He even summoned an army of zombie bugs to go along with the skeletons, all of which immediately began to swarm Fran.</p>
<p>『Fuck! Go away goddammit!』</p>
<p>I tried to smack them away with wind magic, but they seemed not care and they gradually began to bog down Fran with nothing but sheer numbers.</p>
<p>「Hellblast!」</p>
<p>「Venom Bullet!」</p>
<p>「Gravitational Pressure!」</p>
<p>And to top things off, the lich even started firing high tier spells at us one after another without any sort of pause. Its ability to ignore incantations was doing it wonders.</p>
<p>「Guh!」</p>
<p>We erected magical barriers and tried our best to defend against his relentless assault, but we couldn’t stop Fran from gradually accumulating damage.</p>
<p>『Fran! Dodge instead! Don’t bother trying to block his attacks!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Kakakaka!」</p>
<p>Fran tried to dodge the incoming spells, but all the undead refused to get out of her way. Her HP soon began to plummet; I wouldn’t be able to heal her in time.</p>
<p>「Summon: High Tier Undead.」</p>
<p>Jean tried to give us a hand by summoning a subordinate of his own.</p>
<p>「Take the stage, Stephan!」</p>
<p>Sweet! Jean managed to summon an undead that was at least as powerful as the lich’s legendary skeletons. It had some sort of appraisal block skill, so I couldn’t appraise it, but the magical energy emanating from its body seemed to indicate that it was a solid B level threat.</p>
<p>The skeletons Fran was up against seemed to respond to it with surprise, and as a result, their movements temporarily dulled.</p>
<p>That said, the undead Jean summoned didn’t actually appear to be all that strong. It was about the size and shape of a human child. If it didn’t have pitch black holes in place of eyeballs, and I hadn’t witnessed Jean summon it, I probably never would’ve thought it to be an undead at all, in fact.</p>
<p>「That’s… How exactly did you managed to summon <i>that</i>?」</p>
<p>The lich was so shocked by Jean’s summon that it stopped attacking.</p>
<p>The thing Jean had managed to summon was the Soul Eater. When the hell did he manage to get his hands on that anyways?</p>
<p>The Soul Eater was supposed to be one of the lich’s subordinates, but for whatever reason, it was now obeying Jean instead.</p>
<p>The only two skills you actually need to take control of an undead are Spirit Control and Ghost Magic. That said, the Lich had more mana than Jean and its Spirit Control was higher level too, so it didn’t really make sense for Jean to be able to wrestle control from it, regardless of how talented he was.</p>
<p>「I am a necromancer, you know? I’ve plenty of countermeasures when it comes to the undead.」</p>
<p>Apparently Stefan was actually the name of the Wraith that Jean was planning to use against the Soul Eater. His plan for said wraith was pretty easy see right through, given that it only had three skills: Undead Resist, Absorption Resist, and Erosive Fusion.</p>
<p>The first step was obviously to have the wraith get eaten by the Soul Eater. A normal undead would end up getting absorbed by the Soul Eater right there and then, but Stephan’s skills would allow it to survive and then take control of it through the use of its Erosive Fusion.</p>
<p>Apparently, Jean had the Soul Eater eat Stephan last time he came here, but he thought the plan had ended in failure since the Soul Eater didn’t seem to show any signs of being affected.</p>
<p>However, Stephan hadn’t actually been defeated. Instead, he managed to slowly erode away at the Soul Eater over the course of several years before finally taking control of it.</p>
<p>When Jean finally made his way back to the dungeon, Stephan had telepathically informed him of what had happened.</p>
<p>「Kukakaka! How marvelous! Very well, I shall allow you to serve me after I end your life. I will make use of that mind of yours in order to fulfill my dearest wish.」</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「I refuse.」</p>
<p>「You have no choice in the matter.」</p>
<p>Fran and I managed to group up with the Soul Eater and eliminate about half the skeletons while Jean bought us time with his conversation.</p>
<p>The Soul Eater was ridiculously powerful. It almost seemed immortal so long as it was up against the undead. The moment it touched any of them, it’d immediately absorb every last bit of their mana. They couldn’t attack it without carefully plotting their next moves first.</p>
<p>The lich’s attention had all been focused on Jean, so it had yet to move. The skeletons weren’t doing as hot either, so it was pretty much now or never.</p>
<p>『Jean, I’m going to seal off his ability to use space/time magic. Can you use the staff? If that’ll push you too hard, then w-』</p>
<p>（I don’t mind.）</p>
<p>『Alright. Activate it whenever, we’ll match your pace.』</p>
<p>（Understood.）</p>
<p>I begin to focus on the lich’s movements as Jean raises his staff to the sky once more.</p>
<p>「Aidoneus’ Blessing, commence activation!」</p>
<p>「That staff again? It won’t work on me. Are you planning to use it to annihilate the skeletons? Please do, I’d like for you exhaust all your life energy. Your corpse will be in better condition that way.」</p>
<p>「Aidoneus’ Blessing, grant peace to those unable to achieve salvation!」</p>
<p>『Skill Taker!』</p>
<p>Fuck yeah, it worked! I managed to steal his Lv 7 space/time magic!</p>
<p>「Sing them a melody of love, hate, and resentment!」</p>
<p>「It’s pointless I sa—w-wait! What!?」</p>
<p>The lich started to panic as his body was enveloped by the staff’s light.</p>
<p>「Impossible! Impossible I say! I refuse to fall in a place like this!」</p>
<p>The lich screamed in agony from within the light; it had yet to vanish.</p>
<p>「Guaaaaaaaahhh! I’m getting purified!! My urge to exact revenge… is fading away! Arghhhhhhhhhhh!」</p>
<p>The lich was as strong as expected, it was taking quite a bit of time to ascend because of how strong it was… Or at least that was what I'd thought.</p>
<p>A bit of time passed, and the light faded away.</p>
<p>But the lich did not.</p>
<p>『Shit! The bastard managed to hang on.』</p>
<p>In fact, there was something strange going on with his body.</p>
<p>「Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaggggggggghhhhhhhhhh!!!」</p>
<p>An incredible amount of magical energy was flowing into the lich from its surroundings, likely due to the fact that it was a dungeon master.</p>
<p>「Something’s… wrong?」</p>
<p>「He’s absorbing grudges from the undead spirits around him.」</p>
<p>「Meaning?」</p>
<p>Jean was too busy lying flat on the ground to answer Fran’s question; he was completely out of breath. Though we gave him another stamina potion to down, he still didn’t seem all that well. And so, Stephan had answered the question in his place. The fact that he was basically fluent made me feel as if he really was a human being.<br>
「The Principle of Impurity is allowing him to absorb the malice bore by undead spirits around him and convert them into power. I personally am not affected as a result of my resistances, but I can’t say the same for any of the other undead, nor what remains of the Furnace of Malice.」</p>
<p>The Furnace of Malice that Stephan was referring to was the thing he destroyed earlier. As implied by its name, it used malice produced by the undead as fuel and converted it to magical energy. The malice that the furnace ran on didn’t really end up going anywhere after the furnace had been blown up, so it was pretty much just drifting around the dungeon.</p>
<p>Absorbing all that malice had managed to stop the lich from being purified by Aidoneus’ Blessing, as the two effects basically ended up counteracting each other.</p>
<p>The lich’s unique and extra skills allowed it to convert all of the absorbed malice into its own power.</p>
<p>「KUKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAAAA!」</p>
<p>『So uh, is it just me or does he look a bit weird right now?』</p>
<p>「My guess would be that he absorbed more than he could handle. All that malice ended up turning into what is effectively a ball of nothing but fury and bloodlust. The lich itself has probably even lost the ability to think altogether.」</p>
<p>That seems just a bit bad. I mean like, won’t he end up going berserk or something?</p>
<p>『All we need is one more push with Aidoneus’ Blessing.』</p>
<p>「That’s an impossible request. My lord’s life wouldn’t last.」</p>
<p>『Can’t you use it or something then?』</p>
<p>「Named items can only be used by those that they approve of. I’m afraid my lord is the only one with said approval…」</p>
<p>Shit, so only Jean can use it? God damn.</p>
<p>Given no other choice, I try firing a bit of magic in the Lich’s direction, but it ends up getting repelled by a black, miasma-like aura.”</p>
<p>「Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaggggggggghhhhhhhhhh!!!」</p>
<p>Ooookay, this isn’t looking good. All the hatred and curses that the lich sucked started to leak out of its body and overflow. Its black aura began to expand even further. I can tell at a glance that we were in a pretty bad spot.</p>
<p>「The malice he’s gathered is so concentrated that it’s began to take physical form. Be careful not to get swallowed up, any living things that do will likely perish immediately.」</p>
<p>Don’t have to tell me that. Shit, what do I do? The Warp Feather wasn’t going to work. Space/time magic probably wasn’t going to work either. The Lich was unsealable, so I probably couldn’t just dump him somewhere sealed off with space/time spells.</p>
<p>Stephan hurried over to where Jean was and lifted him up off the ground.</p>
<p>「I’ll take of My Lord, though I can’t say I’m capable of doing the same for you…」</p>
<p>『Come on! Lend us a hand here!』</p>
<p>「Sorry.」</p>
<p>Both Jean and the Corpse Eater were swallowed by the dark miasma as the Lich’s malice continued to surge and grow.</p>
<p>『Fran, deploy your magic barriers in front of you at full strength! Make sure you double layer it with purification magic!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>『Shapeshift!』</p>
<p>I change my form to that of a large shield. The material that it’s made of is rather thin because I had to stretch myself, but that didn’t matter. I needed to make sure none of the miasma touched Fran. After changing forms, I overboosted the sorcerer skill and immediately created a magical barrier with all my strength behind it.</p>
<p>『Guuuuhhhhh!』</p>
<p>The magical barrier creaked under the force of the lich’s malice; it looked as if it was about to break at any given moment.</p>
<p>My durability rapidly began to plummet as the barriers warped more and more out of shape.</p>
<p>「Mas…ter!」</p>
<p>『Fran!』</p>
<p>The malice was far too powerful. Fran’s barrier was slowly being twisted out of shape as well; there was too much pressure on her for her to last. At this rate, she was going to end up getting swallowed up by the miasma.</p>
<p>Shit, what do I do? I still have a few points remaining, so I can probably throw them into something right now. But what? Do I point physical barrier? Purification magic? Fuck, what do I do!?</p>
<p>Wait, I still had a skill I’d yet to use, a skill that’d strengthen both my barriers and ability to purify.</p>
<p>『Fuck it, let’s go! Latent Potential Release!』</p>
<p>A huge wave a magical energy suddenly surged from within me.</p>

    < /br>

        
		<p><b>80. OP System Announcer</b></p>
<p>I ended up using Latent Potential Release in order to fight back against the Lich's out-of-control negative energy.</p>
<p>Magical energy had began to overflow from within my body. Sweet! We might actually be able to do this!<span id="more-86"></span></p>
<p>Wait, wait, holy shit! My durability is going down twice as quickly as it was before! I’m probably not even going to be able to last five minutes if this keeps up.</p>
<p>〈You are currently in a perilous situation. Action is advised.〉</p>
<p>Huh? Who the hell was that?</p>
<p>〈I am… _____. Error encountered. Unit name has been deleted by creator. Unit name is currently blank.〉</p>
<p>Er, that's not really what I meant. Like, are you a system announcement kinda thing or something?</p>
<p>〈Correct. The system announcement feature denoted by unit name “Master” is one of many tasks within the realm of of my capabilities. The effect of the "Latent Potential Release" skill has temporarily restored me from the “frozen” state.〉</p>
<p>There’s still quite a bit I want to ask, but this isn’t the time for it. I have to do something to get us out of this shitty situation.</p>
<p>〈Unit name “Master” will be destroyed in 279 seconds. The status quo dictates that the possibility of the enemy unit ceasing the emission of its thoughts within the aforementioned time frame is gauged to be 13%. The possibility of unit name “Fran” losing all function is gauged to be 91%.〉</p>
<p>Holy crap. I should probably put points into my magical barriers or upgrade my purification skill so I can protect her. Argghhhh, which one should I pick? Shit! Hey System Announcer, which do you think is better?</p>
<p>〈Neither of the two previously proposed concepts will provide a solution. Thus, neither choice is recommended.〉</p>
<p>So both ideas suck?</p>
<p>〈Correct. Both options result in scenarios with approximately a 70% chance for unit name “Fran” to cease all function.〉</p>
<p>Then is there any sort of better option?</p>
<p>〈Yes. Would you like to proceed with an interaction that would result in a probability of unit name “Fran” retaining function?〉</p>
<p>Yes please!</p>
<p>〈Please grant an override. Access to your skills is required.〉</p>
<p>S-Sure. Do whatever you want!</p>
<p>〈Access acknowledged. Initializing interactions.〉</p>
<p>The system announcer seems to know much more than me, so I’ll guess I’ll just leave it to him. In fact, leaving everything to him feels like second nature, for some odd reason.</p>
<p>〈The space/time spell “Quick Zone” has been activated.〉</p>
<p>The spell’s effect was to speed up one’s perception, so its activation caused everything to start to move in what seemed like slow motion.</p>
<p>Oh wait, I get it now. The spell’s use bought us quite a bit of time, so we’d be able to think our strategies through. Good job, system announcer.</p>
<p>〈Top priority has been placed on preserving unit name "Fran." "Fran" will now be safeguarded in the most optimal possible manner.〉</p>
<p>〈Five self evolution points have been used. The “Shapeshift” skill has evolved into the “Transform” skill.〉</p>
<p>Woah, he’s using self evolution points?! Er, well, I guess I did tell him he could do whatever he wanted.</p>
<p>Thanks to that though, I only had 20 self evolution points remaining.</p>
<p>My body abided by the system announcer’s will and transformed. My overall shape stayed pretty much the same; I remained a shield, but a part of me seemed to expand and wrap itself around Fran’s frame. It looked like Transform allowed me to alter both my shape and mass as opposed to just the former.</p>
<p>I didn’t just protect her from attacks that came directly from the front. My body also flowed into and filled any gaps in the Black Cat set she wore. I basically ended becoming a piece of armour myself.</p>
<p>Becoming her armour allowed me to do more than just protect her from physical attacks, it also allowed me to deploy a 360 degree magical barrier around her, thereby bolstering her defenses even further. The combination of my overboosted magical barrier and her own ended up creating quite the decent shield.</p>
<p>Oh shit! This is just like A**do! I’m not a sword or spear; I’m actually more like a gauntlet-type weapon now than anything seeing as how I’m attached to her by the hands and all that.</p>
<p>〈Computational power has dropped as a result of the transformation and barrier deployment. Five self-evolution points have been consumed. “Thought Division” has evolved into “Parallel Processing.” Computing power has been restored.〉</p>
<p>Oh fuck it, I don’t care anymore! Use as many points as you want, as long as it works!</p>
<p>〈Shortage of self-evolution points detected.〉</p>
<p>Well yeah, no shit! Look at how many you just used!</p>
<p>〈Six self-evolution points have been consumed. The Appraisal skill has been raised to its maximum level. Lacking prerequisites for the “Eye of Empyrea” skill. The skill acquisition process has been temporarily suspended.〉</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

        </div>
        
<p>So it seemed that he maxed out appraisal because he knew it could evolve. That said, I didn’t seem to meet the requirements for said evolution.</p>
<p>〈Attempting to access the divine realm… Success. Bibliotheca fetched. Access lost; exchanged for information regarding the “Eye of Empyrea” skill. Building “Eye of Empyrea.” Success.〉</p>
<p>The divine realm? The hell is that? Is that supposed to be where God lives or something like that? And a bibliotheca is a library… right?</p>
<p>Though I had many questions, I refrained from asking any of them. It’d probably be better for me not to get in the way for the time being.</p>
<p>〈”Eye of Empyrea” activated. Legendary Skeletons successfully located. Activating “Transform.”〉</p>
<p>I had to admit that Eye of Empyrea was extremely effective. It allowed me to see through the Lich’s overflowing malice. As a result, I developed a much better grasp of my surroundings.</p>
<p>Several thin strips of metal shot out from my body and homed in on the remaining legendary skeletons.</p>
<p>The metallic strands flew through the storm of curses and malice. They looked like they would sever at any given moment, but each was encased in a magical barrier that protected it from harm.</p>
<p>Every single skeleton had its magic stone pierced through with ease. Latent Potential Release had raised my attack power quite a bit. Since the steel fibres were still counted as a part of my blade, I was able to absorb all five remaining magic stones in an instant.</p>
<p>Holy shit! The system announcer is OP as all hell!</p>
<p>〈The total value of all magic stones absorbed has reached 5521. Rank up achieved. 55 self-evolution points obtained. Total remaining self evolution points: 64. 18 self-evolution points consumed. The “Body Split” skill has been maxed. The “Accelerated Thought” skill has been obtained.〉</p>
<p>Huh, so he maxed body split too? I guess it was necessary for that other new skill I just got.</p>
<p>〈10 self-evolution points consumed. Upgrading “Body Split” to the superior rank. Interfering in skill evolution process… Failed. Iterating… Success. “Multiple Body Split SP” acquired.〉</p>
<p>The System Announcer upgraded body split before I even got a chance to figure out what it did at its max level, not that I really mind. I was just a bit curious about its effects is all.</p>
<p>〈”Multiple Body Split SP” activated.〉</p>
<p>The System Announcer then proceeded to summon five of me in human form. I expected them to step up front and help us block the incoming attacks, but they ended up standing behind us instead. In fact, they even ended up using us as a shield.</p>
<p>〈”Parallel Processing” initialized. “Accelerated Thought” initialized. Preparations for high speed computation complete. Analyzing… success. 8 self-evolution points consumed. Flame Magic has been elevated to Lv 5.〉</p>
<p>The system announcer decided to end up leveling flame magic, but he only leveled it to 5 instead of maxing it out, probably because he just wanted the skill that unlocked at Lv 5 or something.</p>
<p>〈Commencing activation of the Flame spell “Inferno Burst.”〉</p>
<p>All five my clones join me as we activated and released the spell simultaneously. All six golden fireballs converged into a single projectile. The spell was supposed to be one that traded range for incredible power in the first place. The system announcer amplified the power of its output further by taking advantage of its calculations.</p>
<p>The super concentrated flame blew a hole through the lich’s miasma, and for a moment, allowed me to see its body. The attack had managed to create an opening, but the surrounding malice had began to rapidly fill up the hole we created.</p>
<p>Shit, we better attack it soon! We might even be able to defeat it if we do!</p>
<p>〈Suggestion rejected. If the lich is attacked, its grudges will likely go even further out of control and create a massive explosion. The chance of this occurring is gauged to be 89%.〉</p>
<p>Woah, seriously? I guess we better do something else instead then.</p>
<p>〈10 self-evolution points have been consumed. The “Skill Taker” skill has been upgraded to the superior rank. Upgrading the “Skill Taker” skill has reset its cooldown. “Skill Taker SP” activated. Success. The “Unsealable” skill has been obtained.〉</p>
<p>Wow, that’s dirty. Hmm… I wonder if Skill Taker SP can steal extra skills as well…</p>
<p>〈Activating the space/time spell: “Dimension Jump.”〉</p>
<p>Oh, I get it now. Stealing the lich’s unsealable makes it so that we can seal it away using space/time magic or something like that.</p>
<p>A moment later, we teleported out the hall and into another room.</p>

		<p><b>81. Goodbye System Announcer.<br>
</b></p>
<p>Note: My bad, I think I referred to the system announcer as a male in the previous chapter. Master says in this chapter that it was a female voice, and I don’t think its gender was ever specified until this chapter. This has been corrected retroactively as well, so anyone that read chapter 81 after like the 28th ish should see an up to date version of the chapter. Curse Japanese and its ambiguous gender pronouns!<span id="more-96"></span></p>
<p>Also a note: For those of you who read ch 80 super early, I made a mistake and said they teleported into another room since it was being really vague. This is evidently not the case.</p>
<p>Third note: Some skills were reworded to sound a bit better. Shouldn’t be so different that you can’t immediately figure out what they were. An example is “Low Tekelenesis Up” being renamed to “Lesser Telekinetic Amplification”</p>
<p>Anyway, without further ado, here's the chapter.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>We were assaulted by high pressure winds the moment we were teleported out of the Lich’s room. We successfully managed to escape the dungeon's interior, but since this was a floating island and all that there wasn't exactly anywhere we could go. As a result, we were now free falling from high up in the sky, way above the clouds.</p>
<p>Fran’s eyes were closed and her body limp, but luckily, it seemed that it was just because she passed out. She still had half her HP remaining, and she seemed like she was just fine. Her complexion was pretty normal too. I decided to use heal and purify on her just in case though.</p>
<p>『You still alive, Urushi?』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>It looked like Urushi was doing alright. Wait a second, I can both see and appraise him despite the fact that he’s still in Fran’s shadow! I guess that must be another one of Eye of Empyrea’s effects.</p>
<p>Like Fran, Urushi was also missing a fair chunk of his HP. That was it though, neither of he or Fran seemed to be suffering from any status abnormalities.</p>
<p>〈Warning. Unit name “Master” only has 35 seconds worth of durability remaining.〉</p>
<p>Oh, system announcer chick! Thanks a tonne, we wouldn't have been able to get ourselves out of that mess without you.</p>
<p>〈Terminating the “Latent Potential Release” skill. Unit with temporary name “System Announcer” will once again be deprived of its abilities.〉</p>
<p>The system announcer’s voice seemed to waver the moment she declared that Latent Potential Release was coming to an end.</p>
<p>Wait, so what happens now? Are things just going to go back to normal for you or something?</p>
<p>〈Correct. Unit with temporary name “System Announcer” will revert to being restricted to the relaying of information and translation.〉</p>
<p>There’s still a bunch of stuff I want to ask you. Will I be able to talk to you again if I use Latent Potential Release later or something?</p>
<p>〈Unlikely. The acquisition of the Eye of Empyrea skill and the use of abilities far beyond usual limits has caused damage to areas that would have otherwise been developed further in the future. The chance of the unit with temporary name “System Announcer” being awakened on any given activation of Latent Potential Release is gauged to be approximately 2%. 〉</p>
<p>Huh? Wait, hold on then! There’s a bunch of stuff I want to ask!</p>
<p>〈Unit name “Master.” Unit with temporary name “System Announcer” thanks you. No. I thank you.〉</p>
<p>The system announcer suddenly switches to using pronouns to address itself.</p>
<p>〈Not even god would allow me to exist in my normative form. My creator erased me and transformed me into naught but an empty vessel. Though it lasted but a transient moment, I am glad I was able to be of assistance. I truly thank you, master of mine, but you must be warned. The path you shall take in the future will be harsh. The God of Wisdom is unlikely to confer upon you its blessings, for…〉</p>
<p>Her voice suddenly cut off.</p>
<p>System announcer? System announcer!?</p>
<p>〈…〉</p>
<p>『Err… I guess you can’t talk anymore.</p>
<p>I still wanted to ask you about a whole bunch of stuff, but whatever. Don’t worry about it.』</p>
<p>『Ya know, looked to me like the system announcer itself was never more than just a fragment of something else in the first place. Using Latent Potential Release allowed you to use it or whatever, but every last speck of it is gone now cause you had to use abilities way beyond your limits.』</p>
<p>『So I really won’t ever be seeing her again?』</p>
<p>『Nah, she's probs never going to show up again.』</p>
<p>『Then I guess I won’t be able to ask for her help next time we're about to get screwed.』</p>
<p>『Pretty much, yeah. By the way, you really should be checking how many magic stone point thingies you have left.』</p>
<p>『Oh, alright, sure. W-Wait! What the hell!?』</p>
<p>Some dude was like casually talking to me telepathically. Who the hell was that!?</p>
<p>『Why do I feel like I’ve heard your voice before?』</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I remember now. That’s the same voice I heard right when I reincarnated.</p>
<p>『Who are you anyway?』</p>
<p>『Wellll, I was planning on telling you eventually anyways. And I was planning on meeting up with you in about a monthish, something around that, iunno. Well, telepathically meet up that is, if you count that. Buuuuuut, eh, whatever. Might as well tell you now minus all the pretentious nitty gritty junk anyway.』</p>
<p>『You sure sound laid back…』</p>
<p>『Welll, that’s cause we don’t really count as strangers n stuff anyway』</p>
<p>『Whatever, whatever. Might as well say it. My name is….』</p>
<p>「Master, it appears that you are alright!」</p>
<p>Oh god damn it, what kind of timing is that supposed to be…?</p>
<p>The one who interrupted my conversation was Stephan. The small, child-like zombie was still holding a passed out Jean in its arms. I mean, I was glad that they were still alive, but couldn't they have waited like half a second?</p>
<p>『Hey, you still there?』</p>
<p>『――』</p>
<p>And, he’s gone… He didn’t even tell me who he was.</p>
<p>Damn it, I'm really curious now. Who or what is he? Is there another me inside of me or something? Do I have dissociative personality disorder? Does his soul dwell within mine or something? I mean, I am a sword, so I can’t say I’d be surprised. Man, I really want to know, but I can’t figure it out and just thinking about it isn’t helping. Arggggg!</p>
<p>Damn it. Thinking about it isn’t helping at all. You know what, he didn’t seem like an enemy, so I’ll just save myself the stress and not think about it until he shows up again.</p>
<p>Speaking of thinking about things, whatever was the System Announcer? I guess she might’ve been a soul or something, but she seemed a lot less organic than that. Honestly, my first guess was that she was kind of like the stuff you’d normally find in Sci-Fi novels, you know, like an android or super-advanced, support-centered AI or something. I was pretty sure of it too, but then she started saying all that stuff about being deleted by her creator and God denying her existence and whatnot. Damn it, thinking about her isn't helping at all either.</p>
<p>Whatever, you know what? Let’s save the thinking for later.</p>
<p>「Are you alright?」</p>
<p>Stephan falls in line with me as we continue to plummet. Jean looks fine, but I can’t help but find the sight of him in Stephan’s arms a bit weird. I mean, it wasn't really either of their faults. Seeing a child was carrying an adult princess style was just weird.</p>
<p>「Is Fran okay?」</p>
<p>『Yeah. She’s just passed out.』</p>
<p>A loud crashing sound suddenly filled my ears as I finished telepathically transmitting my thoughts.</p>
<p>『Woah!』</p>
<p>I turned around out of surprise, only to see that the floating island from which we just escaped had split itself in two. Black light erupted from each and every single crevice as the whole floating island began to crumble.</p>
<p>Holy crap. We definitely would’ve died if we stayed inside the dungeon. Thank God the system announcer chose to get the hell out.</p>
<p>Large chunks of rock started to fall from the dungeon’s foundation. The whole structure had started to collapse.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>「The dungeon’s core was likely destroyed by all the malice the Lich emitted. As a result, the entire structure will soon disappear.」</p>
<p>『Do you think that the rocks falling from it will end up making it to the ground? If they do, they might end up causing quite a bit of damage.』</p>
<p>「Most likely. Everything associated with the dungeon will disappear, but the rock that made up its foundation was likely something that was there to begin with.」</p>
<p>That’s pretty bad… The chunks of rock breaking away from the dungeon were so big that they could've easily removed any given village from the map altogether.</p>
<p>『I’m leaving Fran to you, Urushi.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>I had Urushi revert to his usual size before placing Fran on his back. His fur was well… natural fur, so it should’ve be fairly comfortable.</p>
<p>After making sure that she was secured in place, I shot myself downwards and descended below the clouds in order to survey our surroundings. Whew, luckily there weren’t any towns or cities; we near the bottom of the mountain that bordered the Reidos Kingdom.</p>
<p>On second thought, it wasn’t actually all that lucky. The mountain probably wouldn’t be able to sustain any large scale hits, and the same went for the forest nearby. Regardless of where it landed, the giant falling monoliths were going to cause something on the scale of a natural disaster. And to make matters worse, there was a pretty big river right around where one seemed like they it was going to land. Having the giant rock smash a river into oblivion would probably be just a little bit bad.</p>
<p>Alright, what do?</p>
<p>As of right now, there were two big problems. That is, two massive pieces of rock had broken off from the floating island. One was going to land inside the forest about halfway up the mountain. The other was probably going smack in the middle of the river that ran down the mountain.</p>
<p>『Yeah, uh… I guess better make sure the river doesn’t get screwed up.』</p>
<p>To start things off, I dove straight towards the descending slab whilst firing off a few Inferno Bursts. Each iteration of the spell bored itself a pretty big hole, and as a result, it was more effective than what I otherwise would have done if I’d chosen to use Earth-based magic instead. After verifying my success, I started casting wind magic and increased the air pressure. As a result, the falling monolith broke into four smaller pieces.</p>
<p>『Hell yeah, it worked!!』</p>
<p>I cast another round of spells, and this time, managed to break the four shrunken stones into five even smaller subsegments each. Well, I say that, but each of the “small pieces” was still 20 odd meters across.</p>
<p>『Alright, that should be about small enough.』</p>
<p>The next skill I activated was dimensional storage.</p>
<p>『One… two…. three… four…』</p>
<p>I began storing the monolith’s shattered pieces one by one. My newfound mastery in the art of space/time magic allowed me to figure out the exact size of my dimensional storage, and boy, did it have a lot. I should've still had a whole gym’s worth of space, even after storing a bunch of giant ass rocks.</p>
<p>The only issue was that I wasn't really sure how I was supposed to dispose of them later, but whatever, I’ll figure it out in due time.</p>
<p>『Alrighty, that’s the river taken care of.』</p>
<p>By choosing to protect the river, I inherently neglected the forest. The second monolith crashed into the mountainside with a loud smash and completely obliterated most of the woodland. Whew, seeing that really made me glad I managed to save the river.</p>
<p>「Woof woof woof!」</p>
<p>「Are you alright, Master?」</p>
<p>Both Urushi and Stephan caught up to me as I resumed my descent.</p>
<p>It looked like everything was settled, and so, I finally breathed a sigh of relief.”</p>
<p>『I’m fine. What about you guys? Did you get hit by any of the debris?』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「We’re fine.」</p>
<p>「…Wait」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>『You sure you’re alright, Stephan? You’re all glowy.』</p>
<p>「It appears that I’ve reached the end of the line.」</p>
<p>『Huh? What? Why? What happened?』</p>
<p>「This body of mine was one of the dungeon’s many creations, and for that reason, I cannot escape its fate.」</p>
<p>『Weren’t you supposed to be one of Jean’s summons?』</p>
<p>「Indeed I am, but at the same time, I am not. My body was created by none other than the dungeon master.」</p>
<p>His hands became translucent, and his body had started to give off particles of light.</p>
<p>He was starting to disappear.</p>
<p>But despite that, his face was plastered with a content smile.</p>
<p>「Please, take this.」</p>
<p>『Is that… a diary?』</p>
<p>「Indeed. It’s a journal filled with experiences. You will find it a worthwhile read.」</p>
<p>『Wait, hold on. Who's diary is it, exactly?』</p>
<p>「That’s something that will immediately come apparent should you read it.」</p>
<p>Again, he smiled.</p>
<p>「At last, it’s finally come time for me to be at peace.」</p>
<p>『Wait a second, Stephan! Hold on!』</p>
<p>「Master. Please convey one last message for me. Please tell my Lord that… I would like to thank him. I would like to thank him for freeing the souls trapped within that labyrinth, our souls…」</p>
<p>Stephan touched his forehead to Jean’s one last time as his body finally faded away.</p>
<p>『Stephan really didn’t ever stop smiling, did he?』</p>
<p>「Woof…」</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that reminds me, that one mysterious guy, whoever he was, mentioned something about my magic stone stat right?</p>
<p>Might as well check it.</p>

<p>『What the hell?! Holy crap, I’m missing more than half my magic stone points!』</p>
<p>I mean, the skill hadn't ranked down or anything, but my magic stone count was abysmally low. I pondered the reason for a second, only to immediately think of Latent Potential Release. It was probably because of that. I decided to try appraising the skill again. I recently leveled appraisal up to max, so I should be able to see skill descriptions in more detail.<br>
_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Latent Potential Release<br>
Rarity: EX<br>
Attack + 800<br>
Magical Conductivity increases 3 stages<br>
MP + 3000<br>
Cost: 1000 magic stone points upon invocation, and 15 per second thereafter throughout the skill’s activation.<br>
Unleashes the user’s latent potential. The precise bonuses provided depend on the user’s latent potential. As the skill forces the user beyond his/her limits, it will cause the user’s life force to whittle over time. The skill also requires additional compensation. Compensation differs from user to user.<br>
_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Holy fuck, just activating it flat out eats a thousand magic stones worth of points…? Well, I guess it did save our asses, so I can’t really be complaining.</p>
<p>Yup, I’m definitely not regretting any of that all.</p>
<p>I’m not the type to complain, nope I am not.</p>
<p>I really hope I can rank up some more soon…</p>

		<p>82. Making Potions<span id="more-103"></span></p>
<p>Note: Revised Gorudo to Gould. The Japanese says “Gorudo,” which is an obvious mutation of “Gourudo” (Gold). They subtracted a character without really having an effect on the pronunciation. It’s kind of hard to do the same thing with “Gold” since the long o sound is not made explicit from the spelling, so what I did was add a letter that doesn’t really change the pronunciation. Seems fitting enough for me, but if you have any complaints, feel free to voice them as usual.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>The first thing we decided to do after escaping the dungeon was head right back over the Jean’s lab.</p>
<p>「So Stephan has passed on, I take it?」</p>
<p>『Yeah. He went with a big smile on his face.』</p>
<p>「Marvelous. Passing on in such a manner is best possible thing that can happen to an undead.」<br>
Jean woke up, but he still didn’t seem to have recovered from all those activations of Aidoneus’ Blessing. He ended up collapsing just a few moments after he finished speaking. He was still conscious, but he didn’t bother getting up, probably because he was still feeling exhausted.</p>
<p>The only other thing he bothered saying was that he wanted to eat curry, and well, given the shape he was in, I couldn’t exactly say no.</p>
<p>Fran reluctantly agreed to sharing some with him as well.</p>
<p>Jean told us we could stay in the guest room for as long as we liked, so we decided to take a few days to rest up before heading out again.</p>
<p>『Hey uh… are you sure you don’t mind us taking all these items? You hired us, so they should be yours by all rights.』</p>
<p>「I mind not even in the slightest, for they are of little use to me. Do with them as you please.」</p>
<p>『Alrighty then.』</p>
<p>And that settles that, mission complete. We were rewarded with quite a bit more than what I was expecting. Jean generously handed over a whole 400k Gould alongside half the loot we found throughout our dungeon adventure.</p>
<p>The most notable items we were given were the two dropped by the Legendary Skeleton: the magic sword Deathgaze and a cloak by the name of Aidoneus’ Mantle. Their stats were as follows.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Name: Deathgaze (Magic Sword)<br>
Attack: 880<br>
MP: 600<br>
Durability: 400<br>
Magical Conductivity: B+<br>
Skills<br>
Instakill: The item has a 3% chance to instantly kill any foe it cuts.”</p>
<p>Name: Aidoneus’ Mantle<br>
Defense: 40<br>
Durability: 600/600<br>
Effects<br>
STR + 10<br>
VIT + 20<br>
INT – 20<br>
DEX – 10</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>The mantle’s effects seemed pretty good, but we couldn't really use it. It’s the sort of equipment you’d give idiots that don't know how to do anything but use brute force.</p>
<p>A few of the other items caught my eye as well. Namely, we picked up an odd, S shaped flute-looking thing that seemed to be made out of a goat’s horn and a small but pretty ring.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Name: Horn of Impact<br>
Effect: Playing this horn whilst channeling magical energy through it will occasionally cause a shockwave. However, there is a 4% chance that the horn will break upon use.</p>
<p>Name: Ring of Nightmares<br>
Defense: 8<br>
Durability: 200<br>
Effect: Wearing this ring induces nightmares.<br>
_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>The hell… The Ring of Nightmares is clearly a cursed item no matter how you look at it. I can’t really see it having any use unless you want to give it to someone you don’t really like or something like that.</p>
<p>We were also given: a High Grade Life Potion, a High Grade Mana Potion, an Intermediate Grade Explosive Potion, an Undead Luring Incense, and a Bottle of Voodoo Poison.</p>
<p>The potions weren’t all that significant. Er, well, that’s technically not true. They’re the kind that’d cost you a pretty penny or two at a shop, but my repertoire of skills and spells made it so that they’re not really necessary for us. I took them anyways though, seeing as how it’s not like taking them is going to cost us anything.</p>
<p>Fran and Bernardo walked in right as I finished checking over all the loot.</p>
<p>They didn't really seem natural next to each other, so I was struck by a weird sense of dissonance, but whatever.</p>
<p>『What’s up?』</p>
<p>「Nn. Learning potion making」</p>
<p>「She said she wanted to learn how to make them , so here we are.」</p>
<p>「I will, teach her.」</p>
<p>Another skeleton enters the room.</p>
<p>「This here is Peter.」</p>
<p>「Nice to, meet you, I am, Peter.」</p>
<p>It seemed that this Peter guy, er, skeleton, was capable of both alchemy and pharmaceutical practice. Jean’s subordinates sure do have varied skills.</p>
<p>『Isn’t making potions supposed to be some sort of like super special skill? Are you sure it’s okay for you to casually teach her how to make them?』</p>
<p>「Yes, my part, of exchange.」</p>
<p>『Exchange?』</p>
<p>「Curry, recipe.」</p>
<p>Hey! You guys just totally did that deal with my permission!</p>
<p>Wait, is Jean seriously willing to let Fran learn how to make potions in exchange for something as insignificant as the recipe for curry? Holy crap, he’s really gotten hooked on it.</p>
<p>「Naturally, I will, not spread, the recipe.」</p>
<p>『Eh, it’s alright. I don’t really mind.』</p>

        </div>
        
<p>It’s not like it’s something I came up with in the first place anyways, and I am pretty curious as to what kind of spinoff recipes the people of this world will make if it gets popular.</p>
<p>「Don’t have to share anymore.」</p>
<p>『Oh, so that’s what this was all about…』</p>
<p>「Nn. Very important matter.」</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, I did have the skills necessary to make potions. I just never actually tried doing anything with them.</p>
<p>『Would you mind if I joined it? It looks like it’d be pretty fun to give it a shot.』</p>
<p>「I do, not mind.」</p>
<p>And so, we ended up deciding to learn how to make potions, but…</p>
<p>「Tired.」</p>
<p>『Already!?』</p>
<p>Well, it’s not like I don’t get where she’s coming from.</p>
<p>Fran isn’t exactly the type of girl that’d be able to sit around and grind a bunch of grass to the point where you could extract its essence.</p>
<p>「Urushi, here.」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>「Here.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>She eventually just decided to give up and pass the task off to Urushi. The big, vinyl coloured wolf grabbed executed the action with ease by grabbing the mortar with his front paws and moving the pestle with his mouth.</p>
<p>「Woof. Ruff ruff woof.」</p>
<p>『Wow, you’re pretty dextrous, Urushi.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Alright, I better put in more effort too!</p>
<p>『Oryaaaa!』</p>
<p>「Woooof!」</p>
<p>「Go, go.」</p>
<p>Fran cheered us on while sitting off to the side drinking juice.</p>
<p>After we finished grinding up everything, we moved onto the next step: extracting its essence. To do so, we needed to mix the contents of our mortars with water, pour the resulting brew into a flask-like object and boil it.</p>
<p>Normally, I’d expect this to take about an hour, but waiting around for that long didn’t really make the whole process feel like a specialized craft or anything.</p>
<p>『I’m going to try devising some sort of spell to accelerate the process.』</p>
<p>can use magic when I’m cooking to speed things up and improve the taste. I’m pretty sure the same principles apply here too.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t really be too big a problem even if I do mess up because I’m only going to screw around with half the batch anyway.</p>
<p>I distill the necessary water with water magic, control the flames with fire magic, manipulate the pressure using wind magic, and speed it all up using space/time magic. Heh, perfect.</p>
<p>「Master, cheating?」</p>
<p>『I'd prefer if you called it using your head.』</p>
<p>The result of my efforts was a pretty decent life potion. Man, I’m so talented that I scare myself sometimes. That said, the potion Peter made through regular means was still of a higher quality.</p>
<p>You know, I might actually be suited to regular old boring tasks like cooking and mixing potions. Leveling these skills up takes time and effort, but, thinking about what you do can let you mess around with the result. I’d say that this was probably worth looking into. I guess I’ll go around collecting recipes and stuff next time we go to town.</p>
<p>You know, thinking about it, Fran really is a cat. She got bored of what she was doing, so she not only stopped, but even ended up going outside to play instead. Urushi, on the other hand, was totally her bitch; he followed her orders almost desperately.</p>
<p>Peter taught me a few recipes after we finished up our life potions. In total, I learned how to make ten different kinds, with the more notable ones being Mana Potions, Antidotes, and Spirit Potions.</p>
<p>I didn’t really think a mere curry recipe merited this much in return, but both Fran and Jean insisted that there was still more to be owed. I mean, I guess it’s fine since they’re in agreement about the terms. They’re both curry enthusiasts, and that isn’t much of an issue in and of itself, but their passion for it has gone to terrifying heights if you ask me.</p>
<p>「Master, sir, My Lord is, calling for, you.」</p>
<p>Jean asked me to see him in his room right after meal time. There, I found him looking a bit healthier than before.</p>
<p>『How’re you feeling?』</p>
<p>「Fuahaha, better, to say the least.」</p>
<p>『Great. Anyways, what did you need?』</p>
<p>「Ah, yes, why don’t we get down to business. Have you perhaps read the diary Stefan left you?」</p>
<p>『Not yet.』</p>
<p>I mean, he did hand it off to me, but I figured it’d be better for Jean to read it first.</p>
<p>「Would you perhaps mind lending it to me?」</p>
<p>『I was thinking that it should belong to you in the first place.. I wasn’t planning on reading it till you were done anyways.』</p>
<p>「Thank you.」</p>
<p>『Don’t worry about having to rush through it or anything. We were planning to stay a few more days anyway.』</p>
<p>「Understood, and thank you.」</p>
<p>『No probs.』</p>
<p>Jean gently took the diary from me and slowly turned its cover.</p>
<p>It’s really thick, so I doubt he’ll be able to finish it in a day. Hmm… what should I be doing the next couple days anyway? I guess there’s always making potions, but I’d like something else as well… Oh, right! I should check all my skills and stuff.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>I’m planning a second chapter for today since it’s Labor Day and my schoolwork’s finally done and out of the way. Was planning a third as well, but unfortunately it looks like it’s way too long…</p>

<p>Her level’s gone up by 12, and her stats have risen accordingly. She hasn’t really gained any skills, but her Way of the Sword’s leveled up, and by quite a bit at that. It’s probably because of the fact that I have Way of the Sword SP.</p>
<p>The part that interests me the most is her level. Does the 37/45 mean 45 is her cap? Or will she evolve when she hits 45? If it’s the latter, then she might not be too far away, which is good.</p>
<p>The other thing that really stood out to me was the fact that she got more titles.</p>
<p>Undead Killer: A title bestowed upon one who has slain over 300 undead on a single battlefield.<br>
Effect: Activates the Undead Killer skill.</p>
<p>Skill Maniac: A title bestowed upon one who has obtained over a hundred skills.<br>
Effect: Increases the rate at which skills improve.</p>
<p>Skill Maniac seems pretty decent. I guess it means that Fran will end up growing even more quickly. Wait, does anyone else even have this title? Like holy crap, you need a hundred different skills…</p>
<p>The only new equip she got was the Skull Necklace that Jean gave her. I do have a few accessories like the Bracelet of Protection and Bracelet of Poison Resistance lying around, but, it doesn’t look like you can equip more than a single accessory in the same spot if you want their effects to activate. I guess that means you have four main accessory slots: left wrist, right wrist, neck and fingers. I’m not really sure if accessories are equippable to legs, we should probably find out later or something.</p>
<p>The next thing to do was to check over Urushi’s stats. He used to just be a level 1, but now he’s gained a whole 17 levels. His stats are already higher than Fran’s.</p>
<p>But now that I think about it, he was level 1, and only managed to gain 17, whereas Fran was much higher but still gained 12. I guess he needs more exp per level than her or something.<br>

<p>I could actually see the effects of his unique skills and stuff in more detail now because my appraisal's level went up.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">

        </div>
        
<p>Prey Absorption: Rarity Level 9. Absorbs a part of the power of anything it consumes. Stats are boosted upon level up to reflect every thing absorbed.</p>
<p>Kin to the Sword: A title bestowed to one summoned by a special sword.<br>
Effect: He who bears this title will be linked to the sword and can communicate with its wielder.</p>
<p>Kin to the God of Wolves: A title bestowed upon to any of the Wolf God’s kin that possess its strength.<br>
Effect: Intimidates other wolves. Is linked to the God of Wolves and can communicate with it.</p>
<p>I get why he has the whole Kin to the Sword thing, but, where did that Kin to the God of Wolves title come from? Actually, thinking about it, my handle has this wolf-like engraving on it, and I did find myself in the Demon Wolf’s Plains when I first gained consciousness. I might have some sort of connection to that Fenrir wolf thingy. Maybe I should go back to the plain and put a bit more effort into investigation.</p>
<p>Alright, that’s done. Next I guess I’ll go back to checking over my skills. I never did go over what the set skills Magic Resist, Accelerated Thought, and Parallel Processing did.</p>
<p>Magic Resist was well… magic resist, but it did have a drawback in that it also resisted healing magic. It’s a set skill though, so we can get rid of it whenever, which is pretty convenient.</p>
<p>Accelerated Thinking seemed like it would be convenient in battles.</p>
<p>Parallel Processing was the most impressive of the bunch. It was a better version of Thought Division that allowed me to think about 4-5 different things at the same time. If I got used to it, I’d probably be able to cast five different spells simultaneously. That said, I’m not that confident about using it since I only just mastered Thought Division. Fran will probably have a really hard time with Parallel Processing though, seeing as how Thought Division on its own is enough to give her headaches.</p>
<p>Alrighty, the next thing to go over would probably be the skills that only I could use.</p>
<p>Appraisal’s pretty obvious. All that really happened was that it got raised from Lv 7 to max. It now shows skill rarities and provides a bit more details in its evaluations.</p>
<p>Transform: Rarity level 6. The user can change the shape of their body. The extent to which one’s size and shape can be changed vary based on the amount of magical power used and the extent of the user’s imagination.</p>
<p>Transform was a bit different than what I was expecting to be. I tried doing what the System Announcer did with the threads and the armour, but I couldn’t really make anything that didn’t end up all deformed. I could only do a few less impressive transformations. For the time being, I was more or less limited to becoming a bigger sword or a longer spear or something. I’ll have to put in a bit of practice to get the skill to do what I want.</p>
<p>Eye of Emyprea was a skill that reinforced all skills that made use of one’s eyes. Unsealable was quite literal and made it so that I couldn’t be sealed.</p>
<p>Space/Time magic was also pretty self explanatory. I’ve already used Dimension Shift, Quick Zone, and Dimension Jump, but that wasn’t all it was limited to. There was also Dimension Sword for offensive purposes and Slow Shield for defensive purposes. The magical discipline had a lot of powerful and fun to use spells.</p>
<p>As for the superior skills…</p>
<p>Skill Taker SP: Rarity level SP. Steals any skill of choice from the opponent with a success rate of 100%.</p>
<p>The number of days that must be elapsed before the skill can be reused is equal to the skill’s rarity level multiplied by the skill’s level. Extra skills are as skills with a rarity level of 20. The skill’s range is 10 meters.</p>
<p>Hell yeah! I can even steal extra skills now! This broadens our horizons a tonne. The only problem is the fact that the cooldown’s increased drastically. If I use it on a max level extra skill, then I won’t be able to use it for a whole 200 days. I’ll have to be more careful when using it. On the plus side, I’m now able to steal skills from the same person multiple times – not that I think there’ll really be any chances to make use of that ability.</p>
<p>The last skill I wanted to look at was Doppelganger Synthesis SP.</p>
<p>Doppleganger Synthesis SP: Rarity level SP. This skill allows one to create multiple copies of their own body through the use of magical energy. The user is able to adjust the duration for which the copies persist. The shorter the duration, the more powerful the copy. Each additional copy halves the abilities of all copies. The amount of time that must be elapsed before this skill can be reused is equal to the number of copies created multiplied by the activation time of each body further multiplied by 24.</p>
<p>It looks like I can create a whole bunch of copies now, but each will be kinda weak if I do. If I create a single body that lasts 10 minutes, all its stats will be above 200. It’ll have all my skills as well, but with each 2 levels lower than normal. In terms of adventurer ranks, I guess I’d say that it ends up somewhere in the C range. Making multiple really doesn’t help because it halves each’s ability… They’re not that great as swords either because my attack and magical conductivity both plummet. It probably worked when the system announcer used it because I was in the latent potential release state, and my base stats were way higher. I figure there’s a chance that unleashing my latent potential made it so that their skill levels didn’t drop either.</p>
<p>Well, I guess all that means is that it’s not something I’ll be using much, especially in battle. It might be a bit useful when for stuff like scouting or acting like a decoy or something though. Oh, and I guess I could use it to pretend to be Fran’s guardian or something as well.</p>
<p>Anddddd that’s it I think. I’m going to need to practice using each and every single one of those skills in order to actually get value out of them. I have to make sure I know when I should and shouldn’t be using them too.</p>
<p>Alrighty, that’s everything checked over. What should I do next? I hope Jean’s done with the Journal.</p>

		<p><b>84. Side Diary</b></p>
<p>「There you are, Master.」</p>
<p>『Have you finished reading it over?』<span id="more-121"></span></p>
<p>「I have. It would be best for you to give it a read as well.」</p>
<p>『Hmmm… alright, but it seems pretty long.』</p>
<p>The diary’s almost completely filled. It looks like there’s a couple year’s worth of entries in there.</p>
<p>◇◆◇</p>
<p>My body’s been like this for almost three years.</p>
<p>Today, I decided that I would write a diary. I don't really know why I decided to, I just kinda felt like it. I don’t think I’ll be able to write an entry every single day, so I’ll try for once a week.</p>
<p>It’s possible that someone might end up seeing this diary some time in the future. So, person, whoever you are, I’ll write you a little bit of a self-introduction so you know more about me.</p>
<p>I guess the first thing I should write about is my current location. To be honest, at first I didn't really know exactly where I was, but I did know the kind of place I was in.</p>
<p>I was on a giant floating rock, one of the Reidos Kingdom’s secret experiments. As for me? I was just one of their lab rats.</p>
<p>I didn't really know exactly what kind of experiment they were running here, but it looked to me like it was something to do with the military.</p>
<p>They used me as a part of a necromancy experiment. Again, I didn't really know many details or anything like that. All I knew was that I wanted to die. And I wasn't saying this like it was some sort of passing thought. It’s something I was brooding over for a long time. I wanted to die.</p>
<p>You could easily tell that the researchers didn’t really see us as fellow human beings. To them, we were guinea pigs, nothing less, nothing more. It’s as if they didn't understand the meaning of the words "humane treatment."</p>
<p>But yeah, one day a lot of bad things happened, or should I say good things? I’m not really sure which it is. Either way, a lot of things happened, and I was deprived of everything that made me human.</p>
<p>I can still recall what happened that day in vivid detail. That day, they killed me. After cutting off both my legs and and my right arm in a series of experiments, they decided to dispose of me by using me in one last, large-scale experiment.</p>
<p>They used me, a live necromancer, in an experiment. Well, actually, I say that, but I was a pretty weak necromancer. You could barely call me one. The only spells I could use were the Lv 1 spells I picked up in my time here in this facility. Either way they were going to do it. They were going to inject me with curses, grudges, and malice in order to try and turn me into an undead while I was still alive. Messed up, right?</p>
<p>But whatever. Nothing mattered anymore. I was going to die.</p>
<p>They chained me up and placed me in a hallway with a giant magic circle drawn inside of it. Countless curses were poured inside of my body. They used a barrier alongside a sort of special technique to make it so I couldn’t reject the curses as they came to me, and so, having found a body to possess all room’s malice rushed towards me and filled me in an instant.</p>
<p>And that was when it happened.</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell what Goddess was trying to do that day. Was she trying to show me mercy? Or was she just playing a prank on me? I couldn’t tell.</p>
<p>A dungeon core suddenly appeared in the room I was in.</p>
<p>There was a bunch of writing on it, but I couldn’t tell what any of it meant back then.</p>
<p>What I did know was that the core could’ve appeared anywhere else. But it appeared here, right in front of me.</p>
<p>I still don’t know why it appeared then and there. Was it just a coincidence? Was the Goddess of Chaos just messing with me? Or was she pitying me?</p>
<p>I didn't know, and I still don't to this day.</p>
<p>All I knew was that the dungeon core acknowledged me as its master. It powered up my body and allowed me to absorb every single last bit of malice that came at me. And so, the ritual transformed me from a living, breathing human being to nothing more than an undead creature.</p>
<p>I was supposed to be turned into a Zombie Mage, a lower class undead. But even then, it was much more powerful than I’d ever been in life.</p>
<p>But the fact that I became a dungeon master and the fact that I absorbed every single last grudge and curse made me transform into something else altogether.</p>
<p>I somehow ended up becoming a Lich. At first, I’d just thought I became a Skeleton, but I soon realized that I’d become a Lich. My transformation granted me more than twenty different skills and spells.</p>
<p>There was actually a span of three days between the dungeon core appearing and me waking up. I don’t actually know what happened during those three days, but what I did know was that all of the humans on the island had somehow been overwhelmed by the undead and exterminated. Learning that fact made me freeze in shock for a few moments.</p>
<p>Some would go as far as calling the transformation I underwent an evolution, one of necromancy’s ultimate goals.</p>
<p>But I think that’s pretty much as far from the truth as it gets.</p>
<p>My sense of morality seemed to have left with my humanity. My heart felt like it’d been wrung dry, and so, I tried to quench its thirst. I went around the island and destroyed any of the researchers that’d turned into undead.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>Hatred continued to vent from every last fibre of my being.</p>
<p>It hurt. I couldn't help but hate humans so much that it hurt. I felt the urge to completely ruin their lives, to destroy everything and anything they’ve ever loved. I want to kill every last one, to wipe their very species off the face of the Earth.</p>
<p>Revenge.</p>
<p>I wanted revenge.</p>
<p>Vengence was the only reason for which I now existed.</p>
<p>I wanted revenge.</p>
<p>But<i> I</i> didn't.</p>
<p>Becoming a Lich was something along the lines of a miracle. I’d finally been released from my life as a lab rat. I wanted to spend the rest of my days in peace, to quietly live on and enjoy my second chance at life.</p>
<p>I didn't want to kill.</p>
<p>The malice within me, however, did. It refused my pleas and told me to do but a single thing.</p>
<p>To kill.</p>
<p>To seek vengeance.</p>
<p>It forced me to action. I couldn't stop myself.</p>
<p>Hey, you, the person reading this diary. I don’t know who you are or what kind of person you are. I don’t know if you’re an enemy or an ally, a good or bad person. But regardless, I hope that you will tell the world about what happened here. Please, inform the world of the Reidos Kingdom’s sins and liberate our souls from the fetters of misery.</p>
<p><b>April 7th, 3619<br>
</b>Today’s the day I start my diary. Nothing notable happened, besides me deciding to write this, of course. Yeah, that’s pretty much it. I mean, this is a whim and all that.</p>
<p>So uh… yeah, I guess I’ll just quickly gloss over what I did today.</p>
<p>To start, I did the usual thing and enlarged the dungeon a bit. Then, I made a few undead. I still haven’t touched the bodies of the researchers, nor the bodies of my fellow lab rats. I think I’ll focus on making subordinates and accruing GP for the time being.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, by the way, GP stands for Goddess Points. I didn’t know either until recently. I guess they’re called that because you offer them up to the Goddess of Chaos or something like that.</p>
<p><b>September 29th, 3619</b><br>
I’ve finally managed to get over 10k GP! I should be able to get the dungeon to mass produce undead now.</p>
<p>I also tried to write down some stuff about the dungeon itself, but it doesn’t seem like I’m able to. I can try all I want, but my hands will refuse to move whenever I try writing about the dungeon’s core.</p>
<p>It seems like there’s some sort of mysterious power that’s preventing me from doing so. It’s strong enough to stop a Lich, so I guess it’s probably the Goddess or something.</p>
<p><b>November 4th, 3619<br>
</b>I used a bunch of GP to make a strong subordinate. The facilities left behind by the researchers seemed to have a bunch of stuff used in the summoning of undead, so I procured it all for myself. One of the items therein was called the “Hero’s Bone.” I don’t really know if it actually belonged to some hero or not, but whatever.</p>
<p>What mattered was that it was actually just as powerful a material as its name signified. Using it allowed me to summon a Fighter class Legendary Skeleton. It even had an extra skill by the name of “Latent Potential Release.”</p>
<p>I tried pitting myself against it in a mock battle, and it did pretty well. I’m glad, I’ve managed to get myself a strong companion.</p>
<p><b>December 31st, 3619</b><br>
The year has come to an end. This is the fourth New Years I’ve experienced as a lich. I tried making some special New Year’s bread and soup. I can’t actually eat it, but making let me enjoy the festive mood.</p>
<p>Hmm… I wonder what kind of holidays undead are supposed to celebrate anyway…?</p>
<p>It won’t be long until I get enough GP for my next goal. I can almost taste the Undead Creation Studio I’m about to get my hands on. I’m really looking forward to it, I’ll be able to make even more undead now.</p>
<p>Feburary 27th, 3620<br>
I finally managed to get my Undead Creation Studio. Dungeons sure are strange. The studio just magically appeared where I wanted it to without so much as a delay.</p>
<p>The studio was really nice, and a significant powerup as well. The dungeon is now capable of creating many different kinds of undead that it wasn’t capable of creating before. I’m getting better at necromancy too, so I’ve gotten a grasp on how to summon a bunch of different kinds of undead as well.</p>
<p>The only issue is that I’m not really sure what kind of undead I should be making.</p>
<p>The undead the dungeon makes have magic stones inside of them, and most of the mana will ultimately end up going back to the dungeon, but they’re kind of weak.</p>
<p>The undead that I make, my kin, don’t have magic stones. They have fake souls inside of them instead. They end up being much stronger, but, they don’t really help the dungeon’s mana situation much at all. Furthermore, their cores are pretty much made up by grudges, so they’re all kind of aggressive.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>I could always just buff up all the undead that the dungeon churns out if I used Spirit Control, but doing that for a few hundred of them is honestly too much of a pain for me to bother with it.</p>
<p>Alrighty, I guess I’ll do a fifty-fifty split then.</p>
<p><b>September 18th, 3620</b><br>
It seems that the floating island’s path started to stabilize, it’s route has gotten fairly regular. I can try to point it in a direction too, but that takes a lot of mana…</p>
<p>I’m kind of stuck in the middle of a bunch of different countries, but whatever, that’s fine. I’m not all that far away from the Reidos Kingdom, so it should be pretty easy for me to get revenge on them. That is why I exist, after all.</p>
<p><b>April 14th, 3621<br>
</b>The dungeon’s gotten a lot bigger, so my options seemed to have expanded as well. All I can say is that all the dungeon’s more advanced facilities look awesome.</p>
<p>Two of them in particular have really caught my attention. The first was a huge barrier that covered the entire dungeon. The second was something that converted malice into magical energy. Both cost 300k GP, so I won’t be able to get them for a while.</p>
<p><b>September 11th, 3621</b><br>
I’ve finally finished expanding the dungeon. It now spans a total of ten floors, and it can influence the whole island plus another fifty meters or so.</p>
<p>I don’t think anyone’ll be able to land on the island with ease so long as I beef up the air units a bit.</p>
<p>I think I’ll focus on creating more undead and adding traps for now then, I guess.</p>
<p><b>May 20th, 3622</b><br>
Today marks the first time I’ve made a unique undead in a long time. I used 10k GP to make myself a Soul Eater.</p>
<p>Apparently it gets stronger by eating the undead despite the fact that it itself is also a member of the undead. It looks like another run of the mill zombie for the time being, but I’m kinda curious as to how it’ll end up turning out.</p>
<p>I decided to let it roam around in the labyrinth as it pleased for the time being.</p>
<p><b>October 10th, 3622</b><br>
Today, I’m going to be writing quite a bit for the first time in a while.</p>
<p>Someone’s finally come to the dungeon! My first invader! At first, I thought he came on the Reidos Kingdom’s orders, but apparently that wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>I mean, there was only a single person after all, so I guess it’d have to be an adventurer of sorts. That said, he was quite formidable despite only being a lone necromancer. He was riding a Griffon Skeleton — something that even I was struggling to summon!</p>
<p>The undead birds and bats I summoned tried their best to keep him out, but the Griffon proved too strong and managed to break through them.</p>
<p>The forest pretty much did exactly what I’d planned though. It had an illusion spell on it, so it confused the adventurer and made him get lost.</p>
<p>There were undead at every single turn, so he started to get exhausted.</p>
<p>He tried to retreat, so I had a few of my more powerful undead go after him. The Soul Eater had gotten pretty strong too, so I sent him as well. My undead beat out the necromancer’s, but he still managed to escape.</p>
<p>Too bad. I wanted to capture and talk to him. If he was the likeable kind, I might’ve even made him into one of my subordinates.</p>
<p>Oh well, whatever. Either way, he managed to get me to smile for the first time in what felt like years. In fact, I think the smile I had on my face today was the biggest I've ever had in my life.</p>
<p>I still remember what he said, “Fuhahaha! What a formidable dungeon! Never have I considered that I, Jean Dovy, would have to escape from a haunt!”</p>
<p>He wasn’t making fun of me, right? I think it might’ve even been the opposite, in fact. He was paying homage to my dungeon as his tattered robe and skull-like accessories fluttered in the wind. I see. I get it now. That’s what it means to be a true necromancer.</p>
<p>What about me then? I mean, I’m a lich and all, but aren’t I kind of lame? I should be more like him.</p>
<p>Alright, it’s time for a change in attitude. I’ll try to be a bit more conscious of how I speak.</p>
<p>“Behold, for I am a Lich, Ruler of the Undead! Kukakakakaka!” Hmm… that sounded pretty good didn’t it? Er, I mean. That sounded quite magnificent, did it not?</p>
<p>Splendid. I feel naught but marvelous. Kukakakaka!</p>
<p>This is going to take some getting used to.</p>
<p><b>October 28th, 3623</b><br>
I finally managed to save up 300k GP, so I immediately set up the Furnace of Malice. Actively hunting the magic beasts that ended up coming near the floating island was well worth it.</p>
<p>I was thinking of saving the magic stones I got so I could make magic tools with them later, but I ended up prioritizing GP, so I let the dungeon absorb them.</p>
<p>Even something as weak as a Lesser Wyvern nets me around 20 GP. It was well worth having the dungeon absorb my entire stock.</p>
<p>The furnace would absorb any malice in its surroundings and convert it all into magical energy. Linking it up with me effectively produced an infinite loop alongside an inexhaustible supply of magical energy.</p>
<p><b>April 12th, 3624</b><br>
My power increases every single day as a result of the furnace of Malice. I may soon have enough power to enact my revenge upon the Kingdom of Reidos.</p>
<p>However, I encountered what would label a minor incident whose cause not even I could identify. The curses within this body of mine have begun to grow more powerful. It poses no problem, as I possess the ability to convert malice into power, but…</p>
<p>I can feel my hatred grow, day by day. I can feel resentment piling up within me and reaching heights unknown.</p>
<p><b>November 3rd, 3624</b><br>
I have began experiencing moments of which I have no memory. Could this perhaps be caused by all the malice that dwells within me?</p>
<p><b><br>
August 7th, 3625</b><br>
I’ve noticed something strange today. The corpse eater has taken on a child’s as a result of a peculiar reason of which I bear no comprehension.</p>
<p>I recall that it had been a ten meter tall giant just a few days prior…</p>
<p>It appears to have shaved off any excess body parts. Though it stands a much shorter height, its magical abilities have more than doubled in recompense.</p>
<p>It has taken on a form identical to that my own prior to my transformation. I cannot decipher if this has occurred because it was produced from my magic, or if it is simply a result of it being my effective offspring. How interesting.</p>
<p><b><br>
February 24th, 3626</b><br>
As I have no memory of two of the past seven days, I decided to investigate by inspecting the dungeon’s video records. I cannot imagine the demon beyond the screen as myself.</p>
<p>What was reflected within the dungeon’s records was none other than a true Lich, a being that could only be described by the words violent, cruel and brutal.</p>
<p>I feel that I will soon be swallowed by what I see before me.</p>
<p>That, however, may be perfectly acceptable by its own right.</p>
<p>If I am to tread upon the path of vengeance, then sympathy will be but an obstacle. My other self will surely be able to fulfill my thirst for revenge in an ever so cruel and gruesome manner .</p>
<p>October 6th, 3626</p>
<p>My memory loss continues to worsen. I can now only recall every other day.</p>
<p>My plan, however, is progressing as smoothly as could be. I have risen in level whilst strengthening my subordinates. I’ve finally amassed enough power to topple the Kingdom of Reidos.</p>
<p>I lack the prowess to best the Kingdom in an all out war. However, the floating island will allow my troops to catch the Kingdom by surprise. I shall invade the capital and assassinate its royal family before razing the city and turning it into a sea of undead soldiers.</p>
<p>Soon.</p>
<p>Soon, my plan will come to fruition. I need but half a year.</p>
<p>The world shall learn the depths of my malice.</p>
<p><b>March 19th, 3627</b></p>
<p>Today, I regained my consciousness for the first time in half a year. I’ve long handed off the seat of this body’s primary host to another.</p>
<p>But I do not mind. The dungeon has progressed as per my wishes.</p>
<p>There is, however, an item that bothers me. Is the path I tread truly one laid out before me by the Goddess?</p>
<p>It just so happens that the first day I’ve awoken is coincidentally a day in which the dungeon was subject to invasion. The necromancer has returned, and with him came a companion.</p>
<p>The necromancer’s companion was an adorable girl. Her age was likely similar to that of mine immediately prior to my transformation. She possesses great might for her age; her mastery of the sword is none other than outstanding.</p>
<p>My eyes fail me; they are unable to keep up her motions.</p>
<p>It must be nice… to have companions, friends… I myself have never known the experience, for I was both into slavery and denied the opportunity. And it is likely for that reason that she almost appeared to shimmer.</p>
<p>I wish for her not to perish… but I doubt my desire to be plausible.</p>
<p>The party cleared through the dungeon at an incredible pace. Will it perhaps fall to them?</p>
<p>Considering the possibility puts me in an indescribable mood. The joyful prospect of my soul attaining freedom contrasts the irritation that arises from the potential destruction of my plans.</p>
<p>Do I wish to be vanquished? Or do I wish to live on?</p>
<p>I cannot grasp the answer.</p>
<p>I feel as if my encounter with the necromancer and the girl must be none other than the call of fate itself…</p>
<p>I regret that I will be unable to witness the outcome of our encounter. And so, I wonder…</p>
<p>What scene will I awaken to next? No, will I even continue to awaken?</p>
<p>My dear reader, could you perhaps be him? Jean Dovy? Or maybe the beastgirl that traveled by his side?</p>
<p>If so, then I have but a single thing to say.</p>
<p>I’m glad that you were the ones that survived our encounter.</p>

		<p><b>Ch 85. The City of Dharz</b></p>
<p>「Leaving.」</p>
<p>「Take care of yourselves out there.」</p>
<p><span id="more-132"></span></p>
<p>『Are you sure it’s okay for us to leave you with all that stuff to do?』</p>
<p>「I mind not. The tasks you have left me are but ones that come with the profession.」</p>
<p>Jean’s healed up quite a bit over the course of the past few days. He’s finally able to walk again, though he does still need to borrow Bernado’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Jean said that he would handle all the administrative stuff that needed to be done. More specifically, he was going to report the matter to both the guild and country by handing the diary off to the proper authorities. He was also going to go purify the parts of the floating island that broke off and fell once he was done with all the paperwork and whatnot. He said that we didn’t have to worry about it because we were still in the midst of a journey. He had time, and though I was somewhat inclined to disagree, he insisted we didn’t.</p>
<p>That said, I was pretty grateful that he was willing to go out and handle it all. At the very least, I’ll make sure I properly dispose of the giant slabs of rock sitting around in my dimensional storage. According to Jean, we should be able to just dump them in a volcano or anywhere else that’s heavy on the earth element. If we just did that, the malevolent spirits possessing the rocks would naturally go away. Other possible places we could dump them included the bottom of the ocean, the interior of a canyon, or really anything along those lines.</p>
<p>「And with that out of the way, I bid you farewell.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Later.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『Take care of yourself!』</p>
<p>Fran got on Urushi's back. We took off immediately after saying our goodbyes.</p>
<p>「Come back and visit some day. You will always be welcome here.」</p>
<p>We moved so quickly that the laboratory seemed to vanish in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>『He was a pretty good guy.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『We really should come back and visit him some time down the line.』</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>If we stayed on schedule, we would’ve long departed Dharz and gotten on a southbound ship, but we’d yet to reach the city. Luckily, things were looking up. There were no longer any obstacles between us and the city.</p>
<p>I sank into thought as we travelled.</p>
<p>Was that lich… really a lich? Well, I mean I guess it technically was, but, I mean like… who exactly did we fight? Did we fight the person who wrote the diary or his other personality?</p>
<p>I mean, it seemed to me that the whole reason his personality got all twisted was because of the Furnace of Malice or whatever it was it called, but, we ended up destroying said furnace. I’m pretty sure the “evil” lich had control before we destroyed the furnace, but what about after?</p>
<p>Would we have been able to survive if the Lich had really gone all out? Did he hold back in the end, or…?</p>
<p>Well, no point thinking about it now. It’s not like I’m actually going to be able to come to a conclusion.</p>
<p>「Master?」</p>
<p>『So which lich were we really facing in the end…?』</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>『No, it’s nothing. I’m just glad that both that Lich and Stephan were able to pass on.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Two days passed by in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>The portside city of Dharz was finally within our sights.</p>
<p>『I can see it!』</p>
<p>「Ooohh!!」</p>
<p>Our view of the city expanded as we climbed a hill. The sight that awaited us at its peak was a magnificent one, an ocean that glimmered a brilliant sapphire alongside a beautiful portside city. Though the city itself was a bit smaller than Alessa, it carried with it an air of elegance. Its docks were filled with ships of all shapes and sizes, it almost looked like it came right out of a painting.</p>
<p>「Woof woof woof!」</p>
<p>『What’s the matter Urushi?』</p>
<p>「Sea. Happy.」</p>
<p>『Oh, right, now that you mention it, I don’t think he’s ever seen the ocean before.』</p>
<p>「Bark!」</p>
<p>『Alright, in that case, why don’t we head on over to the beach in a bit?』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi began rapidly wagging his tail back and forth. He seemed really excited.</p>
<p>「Fun.」</p>
<p>『Really?』</p>
<p>「Nn. Never been to the beach before.」</p>
<p>Ah, right. Fran used to be a slave, so she probably never got a chance to play by the oceanside despite the fact that she’s been on a boat before. I guess we could spend a bit more time on and around the beach before we leave. It’s not like the City of Barbra is going anywhere just because we didn’t rush on over, right?</p>
<p>『Alrighty then, what are your thoughts on a beachside picnic?』</p>
<p>「Curry?」</p>
<p>『Curry isn’t exactly the type of thing you’d eat at a picnic… I was thinking something along the lines of sandwiches.』</p>
<p>「Curry sandwiches?」</p>
<p>『Well.. I guess a few can’t hurt.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Wooooooof?」</p>
<p>『I know, I know, I’ll prep you something too. What do you think of bone-in meat?』</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>I can’t tell if they’re excited because we’re having a picnic, or if it’s just because of the food…</p>
<p>That said, we couldn’t just head over to the beach right away. We first had to find ourselves a place to spend the night, preferably somewhere comfortable. There was a chance that we would have to stay in town for a few days before we could find a ship headed to our destination.</p>
<p>『Urushi, could you shrink down a bit? We’ll walk the rest of the way.』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>The big wolf immediately transformed into its smaller, more dog-like mode before running after Fran. The two immediately found a path that led us straight to town.</p>
<p>Apparently we weren’t the only people on said path either. We ran into a bunch of different groups travelling to and from the city. For some odd reason, they always moved out of our way the moment they saw us.</p>
<p>I ended up writing it off as Urushi’s fault. Fran and I basically see him as a dog because we know him pretty well, but it’d make sense for the average person to see him and go “holy crap, a black wolf!” It only really made sense for them to want to avoid us. Luckily, Fran had documents to prove that he was her familiar, so no one turned tail and ran away while screaming the moment they saw him. That said, if he was alone, they probably would’ve already sent a few adventurers after him.</p>
<p>We soon arrived at the town’s entrance, unintentionally intimidating all we passed on the way.</p>
<p>I was expecting the town’s guards to demand an inspection or something, but to my surprise, we managed to get by pretty easily. All we needed to do was show off our documentation and pay the 300 Golde entrance fee. [1]</p>
<p>『Alright, why don’t we look for an inn or something like that first?』</p>
<p>「Not the beach?」</p>
<p>『We’ll go after we find a place to stay. Though… the city sure does seem quite lively.』</p>
<p>The city’s a bit smaller than Alessa was, but there seems to be somewhere around twice as many people out and about. That’s a portside city for you, a guess.</p>
<p>『I mean, you probably don’t want to end up camping out again despite finally getting to town, right?』</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>「Ofc.」[2]</p>
<p>『Where in the hell did you manage to pick that up…? Whatever. Anyways, let’s go find ourselves a place to stay. We should probably take a look at the adventurer’s guild too so we can sell stuff.』</p>
<p>One of the most apparent similarities that Dharz shared with Alessa was the fact that both their main streets were practically littered with inns. Since we had so many to pick from, we decided to go for something a bit higher end. The cheaper ones could be unsanitary, so I figured it’d probably be better for us to avoid them.</p>
<p>「Full again.」</p>
<p>『Hmm.. that’s weird.』</p>
<p>We visited five different inns, but not a single one had a room to spare. At first, I suspected that the shopkeepers were intentionally denying us service, either because Fran was too young, or because they didn’t want to lodge Urushi, but it seemed that they were actually telling the truth.</p>
<p>『Why don’t we just head over to the guild for the time being? They might be able to help us out.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We were quickly directed towards the guild after asking around for its location.</p>
<p>The Dharz branch seemed significantly smaller than the one set up in Alessa.</p>
<p>「Hello.」</p>
<p>「Welcome!」</p>
<p>We were greeted by an deep, intimidating voice the moment we opened the guild’s doors, and it was at that exact moment that I began to pity Dharz' adventurers. Alessa’s receptionist was a beautiful young woman in her prime. Here, they were stuck with a buff ass dude. Oh how unfair the world is.</p>
<p>「Did you need something from the guild, young lady?」</p>
<p>「Want to sell materials.」</p>
<p>「Sorry little lady, but we only buy from adventurers round these parts.」</p>
<p>「No problem. Adventurer.」</p>
<p>「W-What? You’re a rank D adventurer? And the card… appears to be the real deal. Give me a second.」</p>
<p>The man held Fran’s guild card up to one of the guild’s crystals. It read without any issues, thereby evidencing its genuity.</p>
<p>「I-It’s real! So you truly are a rank D adventurer, little miss!?」</p>
<p>The buff receptionist shouted in surprise. His voice was so loud that it attracted a few of the adventurers that’d been sitting idle within the building.</p>
<p>Roughly 20 adventurers had gathered around the bar placed in the building’s center in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>「Man Moj, yer just pulling my leg here, right?」</p>
<p>「Come on, it’s gotta be fake. You know it, I know it, cut the shit already.」</p>
<p>And that was pretty much how everyone's reactions went — not that it mattered. Mojh, the receptionist guy, had already verified the card's integrity.</p>
<p>Annoyingly enough, the other adventurers wouldn’t shut up about it at all, so we weren’t able to actually get anywhere though.</p>
<p>「Still buying?」</p>
<p>「R-Right. My bad. You’re the real thing, so I can buy whatever you’ve got.」</p>
<p>「Nn. That spot ok?」</p>
<p>「S-Sure.」</p>
<p>Fran completely ignored all the other adventurers despite the fact that they were making a huge fuss and headed straight towards the Material Exchange Counter. She began placing materials on top of the leather sheet they used for material exchange.</p>
<p>Specifically, she first placed all the materials from the 10 or so lesser magic beasts we encountered on our way here before following with a few of the things we picked up from the undead within the lich’s dungeon.</p>
<p>We didn’t sell all of the materials we got from said dungeon because some could be used to mix potions and the like. The only ones we sold were the ones that couldn’t be used for anything but armour.</p>
<p>The more materials she piled on, the louder the adventurers got, but after the pile reached a certain height, their excitement started to die down; the boisterous noise was rapidly replaced by low murmurs.</p>
<p>And by the time she started pulling out materials from rank D magic beasts, everyone had stopped talking altogether. The room had gone silent.</p>
<p>「That’s all.」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>「Hello?」</p>
<p>「Sorry… I was just a bit surprised is all.」</p>
<p>「Transaction.」</p>
<p>「I’ll get right to it, but there’s a lot I have to go through. It should take about an hour to process. Would you mind waiting, or…?」</p>
<p>（What now?）</p>
<p>『Let’s try asking him for a room or something.』</p>
<p>（Got it.）</p>
<p>And so, Fran asked Mojh about inns that might still have vacancies, only to receive a… less than favourable answer.</p>
<p>「It’s fairly difficult to get your hands on a room round this time of the season.」</p>
<p>「Why?」</p>
<p>「As I’m sure you know, the Lunar Banquet is coming up soon.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「So, yeah, that. It’s something that happens every season. Barbra holds a huge festival every third month, and as a result, many folks tend to gather here in order to head over via boat. Thanks to that, the inns always end up booked completely full.」</p>
<p>「Ohh…」</p>
<p>Crap, it looks like we actually might have to end up camping out somewhere.</p>
<p>Fran seemed to know what this Lunar Banquet thing was, so I guess it’s probably one of this world’s regular festivities.</p>
<p>『Hey Fran, what’s this Lunar Banquet thing?』</p>
<p>（Festival.）</p>
<p>『Well, I mean I figured that much.』</p>
<p>（Full moon.）</p>
<p>『But aren’t full moons kinda like normal?』</p>
<p>（Only during the banquet.）</p>
<p>I tried to make sense of what Fran told me.</p>
<p>The Lunar Banquet is something that only happens once every 3 months.</p>
<p>This world has seven different moons. There was one large one, and six smaller ones. Apparently, the only time you’d ever be able to see all seven at once with the big one full was during the festival.</p>
<p>If it only happens once every three months, then I guess that means they only get "full" moons four times a year.</p>
<p>Oh! I get it now. The date marked on the calendar we found in Alessa was supposed to denote for the Lunar Banquet.</p>
<p>Today’s the twenty sixth, so that means there should be five more days until it happens.</p>
<p>Instead of sitting around inside the guild and just waiting the whole process out, we decided to visit a few more inns in the meantime. Unfortunately, all of the ten odd inns we visited were booked to the brim. The only rooms that were left over were reserved for nobles and the like.</p>
<p>What a pain in the ass…</p>
<p>『Looks like we didn’t manage to find anything yet… Oh well, it can’t really be helped. Let’s head back over to the guild for now so we can grab the cash they owe us.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Worse comes to worst, we’ll ask the guild to let us borrow like one of their tavern’s corners or something.</p>
<p>[1] I changed it again because someone had a really nice suggestion in the comments. Thanks!</p>
<p>[2] Here, Fran says “of course” in a way that people in Japan would do in the 1920’s ~ 1980’s. I couldn’t really think of any archaic but not grandiose ways of saying it so I just used modern internet slang instead, since she shouldn’t know that either.</p>

		<p><b>86. Beach Time!</b><br>
We went back to the adventurer’s guild and grabbed the money they owed us. All in all, it totalled up to 120k Golde, which I would say was a pretty worthwhile amount. All we needed to do now was find ourselves a place to stay, and we’d pretty much be free to go do whatever else we wanted.</p>
<p><span id="more-150"></span></p>
<p>But despite our efforts, we weren’t able to find any sort of lodging whatsoever. Crap, what do we do now?</p>
<p>Fran was already three stages past being just bored of looking around.</p>
<p>「Master. Beach.」</p>
<p>『We haven’t got a place to stay yet.』</p>
<p>「Can stay at the guild. I want to go to the beach.」</p>
<p>「Whimper…」</p>
<p>Oh god damn it! Not you too Urushi!</p>
<p>Eh, I guess it can’t really be helped. We’ll give up trying to find a place for now and go spend some time playing by the seaside.</p>
<p>『Alright, alright, I get it. Let’s head over to the marketplace so we can buy ingredients and whatnot.』</p>
<p>Screw it, if we’re going to just mess around, we might as well enjoy ourselves as much as possible.</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>The most important part of having a good time was to first get everything you needed set up. Knowing that, we first headed straight to the marketplace. Dharz’ had a port, so I had the sneaking suspicion that here, we might've be able to get our hands on stuff we’d have a lot of trouble getting elsewhere.</p>
<p>It turned out that I was spot on. The market was stocked full of the ocean’s bounty. The first thing to catch my eye was an odd, bright blue salt. It looked like the type of stuff you’d buy if you really wanted to splurge; it was listed at ten times the price of even the finest white salt.</p>
<p>Apparently, said blue salt was one of the city's specialities. You couldn't get it from anywhere other the rank G dungeon that sat right outside the city's boundaries.</p>
<p>Fran immediately perked up upon catching wind of the word “dungeon,” but quickly lost interest as she was told more about it.</p>
<p>The dungeon was relatively small. All in all, it consisted of but a single floor. You could make it all the way to the dungeon core in about thirty minutes and the only notable thing you could get was blue salt. The magic beasts that inhabited it were not only weak, but also few and far inbetween. Even I quickly grew bored of hearing about it, so Fran losing interest was practically a given.</p>
<p>I mean, it did sound like a pretty fun experience, at least at first. I mean, you would have to have the ability to both breathe and fight underwater in order to even get to it. That, however, was where all my interest waned, as the dungeon itself was just a regular, above water cave. You could even buy the only valuable thing the dungeon produced on the market, so… yeah. No thanks.</p>
<p>「What’s that?」</p>
<p>『It’s a fish type magic beast. They call them Pyragenia, and apparently they taste pretty damn good.』</p>
<p>「And that?」</p>
<p>『Pretty sure it’s just a crab claw, albeit a really big one.』</p>
<p>「Bark.」</p>
<p>『Do you want one, Urushi?』</p>
<p>We quickly went around the marketplace and bought whatever caught our eyes before finally heading to the beach.</p>
<p>It’s still early spring, and it’s kind of cold, so there aren’t any other people around. We’ve basically got the whole thing to ourselves.</p>
<p>「Beach!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>Fran took off her shoes and cloak and made a beeline straight for the sea the moment we arrived. Urushi quickly followed suit and immediately jumped in after her.</p>
<p>The water temperature was pretty much about as low as you'd expect it to be given the time of year, but Urushi’s got fur, so he should be fine despite the temperature. As for Fran… well, I guess she’ll be okay if she uses magic to warm herself up.</p>
<p>『Hey, calm down you two. You guys are going to-』</p>
<p>「Uaahhh!」</p>
<p>「Whimper.」</p>
<p>Just as I was about to warn them, both Urushi and Fran opened their mouths only to have their gaping maws filled to the brim with seawater. And as you’d expect, both immediately spat it back out with frowns plastered across their faces.</p>
<p>「Blech」</p>
<p>「Whimper!」</p>
<p>The two were then swallowed by an incoming wave and thrown back onto the beach. Their sopping left bodies were left sprawled all over the sand; the sea had treated them exactly as it would a pair of corpses.</p>
<p>Fran was a person whose stats far surpassed what was commonly thought of as the human limit. Urushi was a Darkness Wolf, a magical beast with incredible power. Yet, both were reduced to mere puppets by Mother Nature’s hands.</p>
<p>『The sea’s full of nothing but saltwater, so you’re not exactly going to have a good time if you let it get in your mouth.』</p>
<p>「Didn’t know.」</p>
<p>「Yelp…」</p>
<p>Both Fran and Urushi were really looking forward to the whole beach thing, but the sudden series of unfortunate events seemed to have completely killed all their enthusiasm.</p>
<p>「And it feel gross.」</p>
<p>「Whimper…」</p>
<p>『What do you mean?』</p>
<p>「Feet being swallowed.」</p>
<p>「Woof…」</p>
<p>Ah, right. When the waves wash over your feet, you kind of get pulled towards the sea together with the sand you’re standing on. Neither Fran nor Urushi seemed really enjoy the sensation. They felt quite the opposite, in fact.</p>
<p>『Are you guys not feeling up for it anymore then?』</p>
<p>「Nn…」</p>
<p>「Woof…」</p>
<p>The two trudged their way back over to me as water continued to drip from their sogging wet bodies. I could almost swear that they were about as gloomy as they’d be at a funeral.</p>
<p>『Why don’t we eat so you guys can get all cheered up?』</p>
<p>「Curry…?」</p>
<p>『I didn’t actually make anything else yet, so sure, why not?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『Here’s something for you too, Urushi.』</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>I brought a giant hunk of meat out of my dimensional storage for the latter of the two to enjoy..</p>
<p>The fresh sea breeze almost seemed to embrace us as we ate a meal under a clear, blue sky.</p>
<p>It seemed that Fran had never experienced anything quite like this, and so, her mood gradually recovered. That said, I wasn't about to let her go with nothing but a bad impression of what I considered a wonderful waterfront playground. I mean, she had still yet to enjoy all that the beach had to offer. Spending a day by the beachside meant so much more than just messing around in the ocean.</p>
<p>The first activity I had her try was one of mankind’s most fundamental seaside pastimes.</p>
<p>「Fishing rod?」</p>
<p>After scouting around the beach for a bit, I found what was effectively the ideal fishing spot. I was going to make sure Fran enjoyed her beach visit, and this was pretty much the perfect opportunity, so I quickly led her over after she finished eating.</p>
<p>The area was a bit rocky, but that wasn’t really much of a problem. In fact, the change of terrain made it all the better as far fishing spots went.</p>
<p>Fran had fished in lakes and rivers before, but this would be her first time fishing for anything that lived in saltwater.</p>
<p>I made a clone and passed it a fishing rod as well. You know, now that I think about it, the last time I fished was before I reincarnated. It’s been a while, so I really wanted to give the old skillset a polish.</p>
<p>「Target, big fish.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, let’s do our best.』</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>An hour passed.</p>
<p>「Woah.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof woofety woof!」</p>
<p>『Alright! Pull it in!』</p>
<p>I was pretty worried that we weren’t going to catch anything. If that happened, then Fran might’ve seriously ended up disassociating the word "beach: from any sort of positive connotation whatsoever. And that, in my mind at least, was be equivalent to a sort of tragedy.</p>
<p>「Success.」</p>
<p>「Wooooof!」</p>
<p>『Wow, it's pretty big.』</p>
<p>The fish was undoubtedly a big catch. Though its features were a bit grotesque, it measured in at a flopping 80 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>As for me… yeah, I didn’t really catch anything. But who cares! All that matters is that Fran enjoyed herself! My pride doesn’t hurt in the least. Ahahaha….haha..ha…</p>
<p>『Why don’t we eat this thing right here and now?』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>I quickly crafted an oven with magic, lit it aflame, and got ready to cook our catch.</p>
<p>『How about playing in the sand while it cooks?』</p>
<p>「Playing in the sand?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, give it a shot.』</p>
<p>「By… hitting the sand?」</p>
<p>『Well, I guess you couuuuld have a sandball figh- wait no! That’s not how you play in the sand! You’re supposed to build sandcastles and dig giant holes and stuff.』</p>
<p>「Understood… Will try it. Urushi, let’s go.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>『Don’t go too far!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Wait, what should I even be making? I guess sashimi’s the most obvious thing that comes to mind, I’d really hate to just limit it to just that. I guess I’ll also grill some of it. Fish soup sounds like a pretty good idea too.</p>
<p>I gave the fish a quick once over before actually preparing it. It didn’t look like it was poisoned, nor did it seem like any sort of magic beast. Its meat was a beautiful shade of white, and it had all the delicious fishy oils that you’d normally expect out of well.. fish.</p>
<p>Yeah, I’m definitely going for sashimi. The grilled fish is definitely in too, especially since I can season it with the blue salt we bought earlier. I could even taste test it by making myself a doppelganger.</p>
<p>I decided to grab the crab and clams we bought off the market earlier and use them in the fish soup. Naturally, the combination of a Japanese person and fish soup implied the use of Miso. This world’s Miso was a bit sweeter than the Miso we had back home, but that wasn’t really much of an issue at all. I had more than enough soup stock available too, so operation soup was a success.</p>
<p>『Alright, that’s done.』</p>
<p>I finished cooking after about half an hour, so I decided to go grab Fran and Urushi.</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>My voice leaked out in an obviously stupefied tone. Welp, I guess this is my fault. I really shouldn’t have concentrated so much on cooking.</p>
<p>Fran had built a massive western styled castle in the time I spent making food. All in all, it was five whole meters in height.</p>
<p>It looked like she had used earth magic to excavate the area around her masterpiece, and wind magic to form its shape. I mean, I know I told her to make a castle, but this, this was far out of the scope of what I was expecting. You couldn’t even really call it a mere sandcastle anymore. It was more like a sculpture, a piece of art, and an elaborate one at that.</p>
<p>In fact, it was so fancy that I almost wanted to call her out for having gone overboard. The only conclusion I could come to was that Fran was fairly artistically talented, and, as her guardian, I felt the urge to encourage and foster said talent.</p>
<p>It looked like the sand she’d used to make said castle was supplied by Urushi, as he had dug a huge hole nearby. He evidently went overboard too, as said hole was something on the scale of a crater.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, I realized that Urushi was in fact still continuing to dig. He was digging and digging and digging his heart out with everything he had. Oh yeah, that’s right. Digging is something dogs like doing.</p>
<p>「Pant pant pant pant」</p>
<p>Yup, he looked like he was having a tonne of fun.</p>
<p>So what exactly was I supposed to do about this whole overly fancy castle situation?</p>
<p>I honestly hadn't the slightest clue.</p>

    < /br>

        
		<p><b>87. A Pair of Grunts.</b></p>
<p>We went back to town after a day of beachside leisure. Since we'd yet to find a place to spend the night, we began looking for one right away.</p>
<p><span id="more-161"></span></p>
<p>And as for Fran’s sand castle? Yeah, I didn’t really have any choice other than leaving it there. I mean, I wanted to demolish it, but then Fran started staring at me with a pair of tear-filled eyes, so I couldn’t bring myself to actually do it. That said, we at least filled up the hole Urushi dug out — with magic, of course.</p>
<p>We ended up spending more time at the beach than I was expecting; the sun was already far past its halfway point. Given the time, I decided to give up on trying to find a place on Dharz’ main street, so I had Fran venture into the city’s alleyways in order for us to check out some of the cheaper inns.</p>
<p>And that was when it happened.</p>
<p>（Master.）</p>
<p>『I know.』</p>
<p>We were being tailed.</p>
<p>Specifically, two men were following us around.</p>
<p>『They don’t seem all that great at concealing themselves, so they’re probably not that strong.』</p>
<p>（Fight?）</p>
<p>『Let’s head somewhere without any people first.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『Urushi, stand by in Fran’s shadow, alright?』</p>
<p>（Woof.）</p>
<p>Fran turned the corner and conveniently ran into a dead end. Sure enough, the two men showed themselves soon after.</p>
<p>「You lost, little lady?」</p>
<p>「We can help you around town if you want.」</p>
<p>The way they called out to us made it seemed like they were accustomed to saying those exact lines. I guess their strategy was to first corner the person before making them lower their guards by speaking in a kind manner.</p>
<p>「No thanks.」</p>
<p>「Aw, come on, don’t be like that.」</p>

<p>They were totally small fry. The only thing that even remotely caught my attention was the assassination skill that the second guy had, so I quickly gave it a once over.</p>
<p><b>Assassination<br>
</b>Rarity level 3<br>
Raise the damage of the first hit performed by a percentage equal to the skill’s level. Only activates if the user performs a surprise attack.</p>
<p>So it maxes out at 10%? That’s not that bad. A 10% boost to my telekinetic catapult would be quite devastating. Unfortunately, skill taker’s going to be on cooldown for another 75 days, so I can’t really jack it from him. The reason for its super long cooldown was because I used it to take Unsealable away from the Lich. Unsealable was of rarity level 8, which meant meant that skills without levels would be treated as ones that were completely maxed out.</p>
<p>Anyways, just looking at their statuses pretty much told me that they weren’t exactly what you’d call decent people.</p>
<p>「Ya know, getting lost round these parts is prettty easy.」</p>
<p>「Not lost. Needless concern.」</p>
<p>「Come on now…」</p>
<p>Crisis detection activated right as the man’s expression began to warp. He no longer was trying to put on the airs of a good natured guy that just happened to have a criminal-like face.</p>
<p>「One more step and will treat as enemy.」</p>
<p>「Hah?」</p>
<p>「Won’t get out unscathed. Best to run.」</p>
<p>「Shut up and get over here you little shit!」</p>
<p>「Gyahahahaha! This one’s got a lot of spunk.」</p>
<p>「Make sure you don’t hurt her. Her price’ll drop if you do.」</p>
<p>Man, you know, every single blue cat we’ve ran into has been like this. Literally one hundred percent of the blue cats we’ve met have been nothing but scum.</p>
<p>Fran silently draws me and gets into a battle-ready stance.</p>
<p>「Huh? You wanna fight punk?」</p>
<p>「Oh, you think you’re tough shit, you little brat? We'll kick your bitch ass!」</p>
<p>The two men leisurely laughed at Fran. Evidently, they didn’t feel the slightest bit threatened. That was about to change. We were going to make them beg for their lives.</p>
<p>「Warning was given.」</p>
<p>I activated parallel processing and began casting magic the moment she finished speaking. The skill’s effects allowed me to easily fire off two different spells at once.</p>
<p>『Stonewall』</p>
<p>『Silence』</p>
<p>I sealed off their path of escape with earth magic by blocking them in with two different walls before soundproofing our surroundings with wind magic.</p>
<p>This way, there wouldn't be any witnesses.</p>
<p>『Don’t kill them, alright?』</p>
<p>（Why?）</p>
<p>『Oh, you know, I just wanted to ask them a thing or two.』</p>
<p>（Understood.）</p>
<p>「W-What?」</p>
<p>「H-Huh? Huh?!」</p>
<p>The two men were thrown into a state of confusion by the sudden series of spells. The merchant didn’t even take up a defensive stance or anything. He wasn't prepared for anything even remotely like this.</p>
<p>There were a few noises as Fran dashed around and hit the two men in turn.</p>
<p>Annnnd it was over. That was it. Both men lay on the floor unconscious. The warrior had managed to put up a little bit of a fight, but Fran was just too far out of his league.</p>
<p>「What now?」</p>
<p>『Tie them up for the time being, I guess.』</p>
<p>I created a few threads for her to use. The threads I made weren't all that strong, I'd yet to master the skill. That said, each was still about as durable as a rope made of hemp.</p>
<p>What I wanted to know was their backgrounds as individuals. The two blue cats had seemed to say that they wanted to sell Fran, which implied that they were underground merchants that’d kidnap people and turn them into slaves against their will.</p>
<p>Given that we were in a portside city, I’d say that it was fairly possible for them to gather a bunch of slaves abducted from the Kingdom of Kranzel and have them shipped off by sea. I recalled Fran saying that she went through a similar sort of experience, after all.</p>
<p>The blue cat tribe’s slave merchants were Fran’s bitter enemies. And thus, I too acknowledged them as enemies. We might end up facing off their organisations some day in the future, so it’d be a pretty good idea for us to gather up every single possible bit of information we could.</p>
<p>『So yeah, that’s why.』</p>
<p>「Understood.」</p>
<p>I was thinking of having a clone interrogate them while Fran kept watch outside, but my plans were quickly shattered as the girl in question started to kick the two men.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Get up.」</p>
<p>「Ugh… what the hell…」</p>
<p>「Shiet bro, what happened…?」</p>
<p>「Urushi, out.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>「Hiii!」</p>
<p>「Uwahhhh!」</p>
<p>The two men were frightened by the 3 meter tall wolf that appeared out of nowhere. They tried to run away, but both their arms and legs were bound, so they couldn’t even so much as stand up, let alone escape.</p>
<p>Fran seemed to be fuming with a sort of silent rage, but it didn't last for long. She almost immediately interrupted their screams and began to speak.</p>
<p>「Question.」</p>
<p>「Y-you think you can get away with this, you lil punk? You know who you just messed with? You ain’t leaving this city with your head on your shoulders! You li- argh!」</p>
<p>Fran kicked the merchant right in the face as he tried to speak in protest. Blood immediately began spurting from his nose.</p>
<p>「Shut up. Only speak to answer questions.」</p>
<p>The two men immediately fell silent upon exposure to Fran’s complete and utter lack of mercy. They were obviously terrified.</p>
<p>「Are you illegal slave merchants?」</p>
<p>「W-What are you talking about gurl? W-We don’t even know what that thing yous saying is.」</p>
<p>「W-We merchants gurl, good hearted ones.」</p>
<p>Yeah no. The principle of falsehood immediately revealed his words to be lies.</p>
<p>『Fran, I’m a hundred percent sure that they’re lying. They’re definitely a part of the business.』</p>
<p>「Are the slaves somewhere in the city?」</p>
<p>「I already told you that we don’t know shit gurl! Chill!」</p>
<p>『That’s a lie too.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Are there more of you?」</p>
<p>「Come on! We don’t know nuttin! We swear!」</p>
<p>『Another one.』</p>
<p>「Might not torture… if you talk.」</p>
<p>「Come on! How many times have we told you that we don’t know nuttin!? Man, what’s the matter with you!」</p>
<p>「Yea gurl, he right. 」</p>
<p>「Urushi.」</p>
<p>「Growl!」</p>
<p>「Hey gurl! Daz not cool! Come on, cut a brotha some slack!」</p>
<p>「This wolf likes human flesh. Livers from live prey. Favourite.」</p>
<p>「Growl growl!」</p>
<p>Urushi slobbered all over one of the men whilst letting a low growl. It was as if he was declaring that he was about to enjoy a meal. The two men immediately paled in response.</p>
<p>「Spill it. Unless want to be eaten alive.」</p>
<p>「Man, come on, I was just saying that I don’t kno- Arghhhh!!」</p>
<p>Fran drove me into the back of the warrior’s hand, and slowly began grinding me deeper though his muscles.</p>
<p>「Argghghghghghgh!」</p>
<p>「Hey man, you alright?! This stupid bitch ain’t – Argh!」</p>
<p>「Learning disability?」</p>
<p>Fran kicked the merchant’s face yet again, this time, completely pulverizing his nose in the process.</p>
<p>「Greater Heal」</p>
<p>「Huh?」</p>
<p>「Shiet? Ain’t dat some super high tier ass healing magic?」</p>
<p>Fran pulled me out of the warrior’s hand and healed him. The wound I made instantly disappeared, and was once again filled by flesh and bone. And as she did, a slight glimmer of hope appeared on the blue cats’ faces.</p>
<p>They determined that the girl wasn’t actually going to kill them, that there was no way a mere child would intentionally commit murder. They hoped that there would be some sort of convenient and logical reason that would allow them to keep their lives.</p>
<p>But Fran’s words completely crushed all their overly optimistic expectations.</p>
<p>「Lucky. Not the type to die easily. Now can use Fire Arrow.」</p>
<p>「Ughh!! Arghhhhhh!!!!!!!!」</p>
<p>「Greater Heal.」</p>
<p>The warrior’s carbonized hand was once again healed back up to its normal state.</p>
<p>「Won’t let you escape. Not with an easy death.」</p>
<p>「Arggg!」</p>
<p>「Hiiii!」</p>
<p>Screams of despair escaped the men’s mouths. There was nothing they could do to get away from Fran. They weren’t even permitted to die so long as she continued to heal them. All that awaited them was a life of eternal torture.</p>
<p>「L-Listen here gurl, we gotchu a deal! We got lots of gold stored away, ya know!」</p>
<p>「Don’t need.」</p>
<p>「Alrihgt, alright! What if we gave you-」</p>
<p>「Stupid? Want information.」</p>
<p>「G-Gurl, we said we ain’t got an- arggggg!」</p>
<p>Fran kicked the merchant for a third time and broke every single last one of his front teeth.</p>
<p>「Skill. Can see through lies.」</p>
<p>The two realized that they had no other choice but to talk, and so, they soon began to answer Fran’s questions in an honest a manner as they could.</p>
<p>Our suspicions were spot on. Dharz was home to one of the blue cat tribe’s underground slave markets. Slaves captured from all over the Kingdom of Kranzel would be gathered here before they were shipped off to the Kingdom of Reidos. Apparently, their base of operations used to be Barbra, but the country caught on and crushed it.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I’m pretty sure that was exactly what happened to Fran. She was probably abducted from some foreign country before being sent to Barbra for processing. The country probably caught on right about when she arrived there, and thus, they decided to move her to another base somewhere else in Kranzel. We probably met whilst she was being shipped over to Dharz.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Reidos buys slaves for quite the price, so the merchants had been using Dharz as a point of transportation and processing for 10 odd years now.</p>
<p>And so, after learning all that, we asked them the hideout’s location, the number of slave traders, and the number of slaves.</p>
<p>「H-Hey, we’ve told you everything now, so you can let us run free, right gurl? You gunna help us, right?」</p>
<p>「We’ll change! We swears it !」</p>
<p>I heard their pleas, but ignored them. Immediately after obtaining all the information we needed, I cut their necks right off their heads with a single blade of magical wind.</p>
<p>They’d probably tell their organisation about Fran if we let them go, and I didn’t exactly feel like it was a good idea to have some sort of underground organisation after us. And I mean, they were the kind of people that kidnapped and sold children, so the world was probably better off without them anyways.</p>
<p>I put their bodies in my dimensional storage for the time being. Now that I think about it, the insides of my dimensional storage have really started to get all messy and chaotic lately…</p>
<p>「Nn. Thanks Master.」</p>
<p>『Don’t sweat it.』</p>
<p>「What now?」</p>
<p>『Well, that depends. What do you want to do?』</p>
<p>「Spring cleaning.」</p>
<p>Yeeaap, I figured she’d say that. I originally wanted to have her wait somewhere while I made a doppelganger and raided the place with Urushi, but I already used it earlier when we were playing around by the seaside. Much to my announce, I actually couldn’t use Doppelganger Synthesis again till the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>『You should probably at least wait till night time.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『How about we go find somewhere to stay first.』</p>
<p>It took us quite some time, but we were eventually able to find ourselves a room at cheap inn. There, we waited until it was time to begin our assault.</p>
<p>Note: Clone = the ones from his crappy skill. Doppelganger = the ones from the SP skill. Just to be clear, they’re separate skills and only Doppelganger Synth has a longer cooldown.</p>

		<p><b>88. Fran the Assassin<br>
</b></p>
<p>『Alright, let’s go.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>It was two in the morning. Everyone was asleep, and even the drunks had gone home.</p>
<p><span id="more-176"></span></p>
<p>It didn't take long for us to arrive at the slave traders' hideout. We made use of Urushi’s Dark Magic, Espionage and Presence Concealment in order to hide ourselves. They shouldn’t be able to locate us, but I prepared Fran a mask just in case they did.</p>
<p>The hideout was fairly close to the port itself. Its first floor was supposedly said to be a warehouse, and the second, a sort of living quarters. The building was guarded, but only by a single person.</p>
<p>『We’ll probably get noticed if we take it too slowly.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Blitzkrieg.」</p>
<p>「Bark.」</p>
<p>Fran made her move. She used Silence to dampen the sounds made by her movements and cut the guard down before he was able to so much as react. In fact, he probably didn’t even get to see her shadow before losing his life. I immediately put his corpse in my dimensional storage, and we moved on.</p>
<p>『Alright, why don’t we start from the top?』</p>
<p>There was no point in doing something as stupid as kicking down the front door.</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran infiltrated the building by leaping onto its roof, cutting one of the windows open, and climbing inside. Naturally, she continued to keep quiet through the use of Silence.</p>
<p>We immediately stumbled across a bed with someone inside of it, but luckily, he didn’t wake up. Appraising him informed us that he was one of the slave traders.</p>
<p>『He’s an enemy.』</p>
<p>（Nn.）</p>
<p>Fran casually thrusted me through his chest and impaled him right through the heart.</p>
<p>「――！」</p>
<p>The man woke up in response, his body throbbing in pain, but he wasn’t able to so much as make a noise. Silence made sure of that. I put the corpse away before he even managed to start leaking blood, and as a result, not even the slightest speck of evidence was left behind. We had just pulled off the perfect assassination.</p>
<p>『It looks like they’re probably keeping the slaves underground, in a basement or something.』</p>
<p>「Clean up first.」</p>
<p>『Yeah. It’ll be easier to free the slaves if we do.』</p>
<p>We decided to do the world a favour and “disinfect” the floor in its entirety. And so, we acted in the same manner as would most other assassins, we murdered every single slave merchant we came across in cold blood. Most of them were stronger than that Gyuran guy we killed in Alessa, not that we had even the slightest bit of difficulty given that they were all asleep.</p>
<p>Chances were, we probably wouldn’t have had any trouble with them head on either, especially given how much stronger we got through the exploration of the Lich’s dungeon. We only bothered with stealth because it would prevent any alarms from being raised.</p>
<p>『This should be the last room.』</p>
<p>It took us five minutes to clear out the entire second floor, a single room outstanding. All in all, we killed six different slave merchants.</p>
<p>The room before us, however, was unlike the rest; its lights were still on, and I could sense a single presence within it.</p>
<p>『Would you mind, Urushi?』</p>
<p>（Woof!）</p>
<p>『Make sure you stay quiet.』</p>
<p>（Woof.）</p>
<p>Urushi eliminated the target and came back after 10 or so seconds. He was as quiet as I’d expected.</p>
<p>『It seems to feel a bit different from all the other rooms.』</p>
<p>The room’s interior design reminded me of a study. A single blue cat was lying dead on the room’s desk. His clothing was relatively fancy, it seemed like he was an executive of sorts.</p>
<p>『I’m going to rummage through his desk real quick.』</p>
<p>I fished around a bit and went through most of the documents they had. The only thing of interest I could find was a note detailing the number of slaves sold to the Kingdom of Reidos.</p>
<p>I’d like to hand this over to the proper authorities if possible, so I decided to hold onto it for the time being.</p>
<p>After looking around a bit, I noticed that there was a safe in the room’s corner. It was made of iron, and it looked like the type of strongbox in which you’d put your valuables. Searching the man's corpse allowed me to quickly find the key. The safe itself wasn’t radiating any magical energy, so it probably wasn’t a trap.</p>
<p>Fran opened the safe as I awaited the results with bated breath.</p>
<p>『Woah』</p>
<p>「Treasure.」</p>
<p>The safe contained about 100k Golde alongside a bunch of jewelry and the like. I guess you could say the safe was, in a way, a sort of treasure box. I didn’t really mind stealing from criminals, so we grabbed every single last bit and shoved it all inside of my dimensional storage.</p>
<p>『There isn’t anyone else in the second floor.』</p>
<p>The next thing we had to do was tidy up the first floor. There were a tonne of people there though, and they all seemed to be awake. Given that it was a warehouse, there probably wouldn’t really be many places to hide either. We’d be put in a really bad spot if someone managed to escape after seeing Fran’s face. Ideally, I’d prefer them not to even see her figure. I didn’t want them realizing that it was a child that raided the place.</p>
<p>There were a few slaves mixed into the crowd, so we couldn’t just blast our AOEs and wipe everyone out. They also seemed to have an underground escape route for emergencies, so a few would probably manage to get away if we made a big fuss. We used infrared vision, echolocation and presence detection in tandem to learn as much as we could before initiating. It seemed that the most troublesome part of this whole thing would be the one room with five different people inside of it. We decided to save that for last and clean out the rooms with only one or two people in them first.</p>
<p>『Let’s go.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>We did the same for the first floor as we did for the second; we eliminated all noise by using silence before cutting open window and climbing in. I used silence again once we entered each room, and Urushi immediately moved to kill the man that tried to raise an alarm in response to our sudden intrusion.</p>
<p>We quickly did the same for two other rooms, one with one person in it, and the other with two.</p>
<p>「Room filled with stuff.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, it kinda reminds me of Jean’s lab.』</p>
<p>There were a bunch of raw materials laying around along side the equipment needed to process them. It seemed like they were making a bunch of different things, as the shelves contained life potions, vials of poison, and a fair number of medicinal products.</p>
<p>『This stuff looks pretty useful.』</p>
<p>「Take?」</p>
<p>『Hmmm, that seems like a pretty good idea. We could probably use it to make potions and stuff while traveling.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Take.」</p>
<p>We plundered so much stuff that it almost seemed like we’d forgotten our initial purpose in coming here.</p>
<p>『Alright, with that out of the way, why don’t we go wipe the rest of them out?』</p>
<p>I didn’t know how many people there were left in the basement, but the only room on the first floor that remained was the one with five people in it.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">

        </div>
        
<p>The plan was to infiltrate using silence before having Urushi use one of his dark magics, Black Veil. The spell would deprive our targets of their vision so we could kill them all in one fell swoop before they got so much as a chance to run away.</p>
<p>And it worked. Fran had the ability to search sense enemy presences, and Urushi could detect any and all life forms, so the two were able to easily wipe out all five slave traders without any issue.</p>
<p>『That’s both the first and second floors down.』</p>
<p>「Basement next.」</p>
<p>『Based on what they said yesterday, the organisation should be made up of 24 people in total, so at most, there should be four more of them.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We went down the stairs as stealthily as would a group of ninjas. The basement we descended upon turned out not to be a basement at all. It was a dungeon. There were two guards at its entrance, but we killed them instantly. They weren’t even really paying attention in the first place; they were lazily facing off against each other in a game of cards instead of doing their jobs.</p>
<p>『Alright, why don’t we save the slaves now?』</p>
<p>According to the documents we grabbed from upstairs, there were currently seven different children trapped here. They were all already wearing slave collars.</p>
<p>「Who… are you?」</p>
<p>Fran’s sudden entrance left the children in the basement in a state of surprise. It took them a bit to recover, but after a few moments, the one who appeared to be the group’s eldest, a boy, timidly looked towards and called out to us. He seemed to give off the kind of air you’d expect from nobility despite his current status as a slave. The contrasting combination made him seem a bit like a cheeky brat, but whatever. One of the girls standing behind him seemed to look a lot like him. The two were probably twins.</p>
<p>「Hero.」</p>
<p>「Huh?」</p>
<p>「Came to help.」</p>
<p>「But what about the kidnappers? They should be up there…」</p>
<p>「Defeated them.」</p>
<p>「You did?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>The imprisoned children look at each other in turn. Well, I guess it only makes sense for them not to believe what Fran was saying. They couldn’t believe that a girl that looked even younger than them could’ve defeated twenty odd criminals.</p>
<p>「Move back.」</p>
<p>「Huh?」</p>
<p>「Back off from cage. Dangerous.」</p>
<p>「S-Sure…」</p>
<p>A loud swish resounded throughout the room; Fran swung me and instantly cut the cage’s bars to pieces.</p>
<p>「Huh?」</p>
<p>「No way…」</p>
<p>The children stared blankly as the cage collapsed. They didn’t understand how they were supposed to react.</p>
<p>「Hurt?」</p>
<p>The female twin’s leg seemed to have an injury on it. There was a cloth wrapped around it, but it hadn’t really gone through any other sort of treatment. She was likely to get infected, at this rate.</p>
<p>「Middle Heal.」</p>
<p>「Huh? It’s better now?」</p>
<p>「Woah, are you a mage?」</p>
<p>「That’s awesome!」</p>
<p>The children started to ask Fran a bunch of different questions, but she didn’t respond.</p>
<p>『Fran!』</p>
<p>「Nn. Someone came.」</p>
<p>We felt someone enter the building. It was probably an enemy. Shit, we have to get rid of them before they catch on.</p>
<p>Fran had suddenly gone silent whilst looking up at the ceiling, so the children began feeling anxious.</p>
<p>「W-What’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「Stay inside. Hide.」</p>
<p>「Huh? What?」</p>
<p>「Don’t leave. Wait for me.」</p>
<p>Fran pushed the children back towards the prison before grabbing me and heading up the staircase.</p>
<p>『Looks like he’s wandering around on the first floor.』</p>
<p>「Searching for something?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, he’s probably trying to figure out what happened to the other slave traders. Make sure you put on your mask.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We climbed the stairs whilst erasing our presences. The enemy that’d arrived was a decently strong looking man. He was fully armed, and not too bad at concealing his presence either. We were only able to detect him because we had a whole bunch of different skills working in tandem with each other. If not for that, we probably wouldn’t have noticed him at all.<br>

_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Holy shit, he’s strong! And he looks like he’s an enemy, especially since he’s apparently a Dark Knight instead of a regular one. I mean, his skills all seem to be inclined towards darkness, and his title clearly says that he breaks his oaths.</p>
<p>And on top of that, he seems like he’s in some sort of weird frenzy.</p>
<p>『Be careful Fran, he’s pretty strong.』</p>
<p>（Nn.）</p>
<p>『Urushi, make sure you hide in Fran’s shadow until you find a good opportunity to sneak attack him.』</p>
<p>（Woof!）</p>
<p>He lived up to his stats. He noticed Fran the moment she jumped out at him, and immediately got ready for combat.</p>
<p>「Name yourself!」</p>
<p>Fran didn’t reply to his question.</p>
<p>「Kuh! Name yourself you coward!」</p>
<p>「Hah!」</p>
<p>Fran ignored his words and continued to attack, but he managed to skillfully repel her strikes using his sword and shield.</p>
<p>「Nuryaaaaa!」</p>
<p>「Ha!」</p>
<p>He even managed to retaliate. Fran’s Divine Sword Arts were a higher level than his, but his shield rendered defenses solid. It was fairly obvious that he had way more combat experience than her too. It wasn’t someone she'd be able to completely smash.</p>
<p>It seems like we ran into a formidable opponent in a place that we never would’ve thought it. We would probably be able to beat him without much issue if either Urushi or I launched any sort of surprise attack, but I’d prefer to keep him alive if possible. He was pretty skilled, so I was pretty sure we wouldn’t lose out completely by keeping him alive. At the very least, we could use him to gain more information.</p>
<p>『Fran, try not to kill him if you can.』</p>
<p>（Nn. Understood.）</p>

    < /br>

        
		<p><b>89. The Twins’ Identity</b></p>
<p>Fran and the Dark Knight traded blow for blow. They repeatedly smashed their blades against each other and sent sparks flying throughout the slave traders’ hideout. The clash of blade on blade rang throughout the building, but Silence prevented even the slightest bit of sound from leaking outside.</p>
<p><span id="more-179"></span></p>
<p>「Nuoooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!」</p>
<p>「Hah!」</p>
<p>The duel was being dragged out. Neither Fran nor the dark knight could really gain an edge on the other. The status quo was nothing but a standstill – which only made sense. Both parties were swordsmen that had awakened to the divine arts, after all.</p>
<p>Alright, I guess I’d better make him drop his sword.</p>
<p>「Ha!」</p>
<p>「Argh!?」</p>
<p>I used Vibrating Impact and Thunder Blade right as I came into contact with his blade. As expected, the sudden shock made the man's hands go numb; he couldn’t help but drop his sword.</p>
<p>But he didn’t give up.</p>
<p>He immediately raised his shield and began to chant a spell.</p>
<p>「Dark Arrow!」</p>
<p>Not that it mattered. We were completely immune to dark, so the arrow phased out before it hit us.</p>
<p>「Impossible!」</p>
<p>「Opening.」</p>
<p>「Guah!」</p>
<p>The man let out a shout as he flinched in surprise, and created an opening far too obvious for Fran to miss. She immediately turned her blade and smashed his legs with its flat. She then pointed my blade at the back of the man’s neck as he fell onto one knee.</p>
<p>And that was that. The man had lost, and so, he looked up at Fran with a face full of frustration.</p>
<p>「How regrettable.」</p>
<p>「Who?」</p>
<p>「A man who sees no reason to give his name to the likes of you.」</p>
<p>You know, he’s pretty energetic for a middle aged man. Oh well, either way, it’s time to rough him up a bit so we can get some info out of him.</p>
<p>『Urushi, out.』</p>
<p>「Growl growl!」</p>
<p>「W-what!?」</p>
<p>Heh. Looks like he’s pretty spooked. I was about to get the interrogation going, but the children came up from the basement just as I was about to suggest cutting off one of his arms. All seven peeked in from the stairwell, with the two noble-like twins at the forefront.</p>
<p>Well, I guess it only made sense. We’d left them in the basement, so they probably started feeling anxious. Thankfully, the battle had already come to an end.</p>
<p>「Stay back. Not safe.」</p>
<p>They fearfully stopped in their tracks as Fran warned them. The male twin's face, however, suddenly twisted as he caught sight of the dark knight.</p>
<p>「Salrut!」</p>
<p>「My Prince! I see that you are unscathed!」</p>
<p>Wait what? That kid was a prince? The fuck?</p>
<p>「You came to save us…?」</p>
<p>「Princess! I am glad that you too are well!」</p>
<p>Huh? Wait, so he wasn’t one of the slave traders? Errr, I guess we should heal him up then or something.</p>
<p>Ten minutes passed by in the blink of an eye as we got up to pace.</p>
<p>We healed the knight and had him explain what was going on.</p>
<p>「Really a prince and princess?」</p>
<p>「Veritably. The prince and princess that stand before you are members of the Fyrias Kingdom’s royal family. They are sixth and seventh in line for the throne respectively.」</p>
<p>「And you? Guard?」</p>
<p>「Precisely.」</p>
<p>「Came to help because royal family was kidnapped?」</p>
<p>「I-It is as you say.」</p>
<p>Apparently what happened was that the prince and princess sneaked out and got themselves abducted. Naturally, the guards hadn't any knowledge of it — until they realized they couldn't locate them, that is. I actually kinda pitied the knight It seemed like he was probably going to end up taking all the blame.</p>
<p>「How despicable those accused criminals were! They even went as far as to put something like <i>that </i>around the highness’ necks!」</p>
<p>Yeah… it does seem pretty bad for members of the royal family to be stuck with slave collars around their necks. In fact, the knight might not be able to keep his head on his shoulders for much longer given the current circumstances.</p>
<p>「I never would have suspected that they the traders would attempt to enslave children of such a tender age… Young lady, I must offer you my gratitude. I would not have been able to retrieve the prince or princess with such ease if not for your noble actions.」</p>
<p>「Only did it for myself.」</p>
<p>「Even so, my gratitude remains unchanged, for it was you that rescued my lieges. I would, however, like for you to answer but a single query. Whatever happened to the traders? I see not even their corpses.」</p>
<p>「Cleaned up.」</p>
<p>「By what means? There numbered far more than just a few.」</p>
<p>「Nn? Skill.」</p>
<p>「What exactly… No, please do not mind the question any longer. It is but rude to inquire the details of another’s skills.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I am more than willing to believe your words given that I have witnessed your abilities.」</p>
<p>I was pretty grateful he acted the way he did. He ignored Fran’s age in respect of her strength and treated her as an equal.</p>
<p>This was a stark contrast from how he treated all the slaves we just freed as well… children. To the knight, the other children were people he was obligated to protect.</p>
<p>『We should probably get out of here soon. There should still be a few more slave traders, and they might be coming back soon.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『It’d be a pain in the ass if we ran into them on our way out, so let’s get rid of all their collars while we’re at it.』</p>
<p>Fran easily removed all the children’s slave collars by overwriting the enslavement spell with a blank contract of her own, much like I did to her when we just met.</p>
<p>Every single last person in the room, Salrut included, looked at Fran with expressions of shock on their faces. Evidently, they weren’t expecting the collars to come off nearly as easily as they did. The shock took a while to sink in, but once it did, their expressions began to change into those of joy.</p>
<p>Made sense though. Their fates were about take a cruel a turn as possible. They were about to become slaves, targets of abuse. But now, they were free. Their collars were gone, and they were no longer at risk of being sold off as merchandise.</p>
<p>「How impressive. To think that you would even be well versed in the art of contract magic!」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Once again, I thank you.」</p>
<p>Salrut paused for a moment before continuing.</p>
<p>「I wish not to say this as one who has received nothing but your assistance, however, I believe it is my duty to inform you that it would be better for you not to reveal your ability to use contract magic in any other sort of public setting.」</p>
<p>「Why?」</p>
<p>「Contract magic is rare, and contract magic powerful enough to undo a slave contract can only be said to be all the more scarce. The only individuals that could possibly possess such high level contract magic would be none other than summoners and slave traders.」</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>Ah, I get it. If you’ve got high level contract magic, then people would probably assume you were associated with the slavery business. Slaver merchants were disliked by the general public, even if they weren’t the underground kind that went about kidnapping people.</p>
<p>「My understanding is that you are a summoner, but that interpretation may not be one shared by all.」</p>
<p>Salrut’s gaze shifted over to Urushi. He was currently sprawled on all fours in his more dog-like form. He was in his normal form just a few minutes ago, but we had him shrink because the kids were getting scared of him. Salrut’s interpretation of the situation was most likely that Fran was a summoner that just so happened to know how to use a sword.</p>
<p>「Should leave soon.」</p>
<p>「An excellent point to make.」</p>
<p>「In that case, why don’t we seek shelter at the hotel we’ve rented? We shall leave everything that comes after to you, Salrut.」</p>
<p>「Yes, my prince!」</p>
<p>It seemed that the prince was offering to have everyone stay at the hotel he had reserved. It was a pretty good idea. Any hotel with royalty in it was pretty much bound to have good security. Thinking about it, the reason we couldn’t find any decent inns was probably because of the sudden influx of people like the prince here. They all had guards and maids and stuff, so they’d needed to book more rooms than the average person.</p>
<p>Fran, Urushi and Salrut guarded the children as they made their way over to the inn.</p>
<p>I figured the twins would be all cocky and pretentious, but it turned out that they were decent people despite being royalty. They weren’t anything like the shit-brained nobles I was expecting them to be. They went out of their way to make sure that the other children were doing okay even though they were all commoners. They also made sure to take the lead as we walked towards the inn in order to abate the other children’s fears. Though they were both just kids, they were still performing their royal duties to the best of their abilities.</p>
<p>Though I guess they do still have a few childlike aspects, seeing how they snuck out without telling anyone and whatnot. That said, they spent the rest of the trip in relative silence, so I assumed they were most likely reflecting on their actions.</p>
<p>A bit of time passed, and we eventually arrived in front of a super luxurious looking inn. A single glance told me that it was the kind that typically only served the nobility. In fact, just seeing it made me feel like apologizing to the prince and his party. Yeap, it is definitely not their fault we weren’t able to find a place to stay. I mean, I know we were trying to look for something a bit higher end, but this? This was way out of scope.</p>
<p>The children were all staring wide eyed in surprise as well.</p>
<p>The hotel’s gatekeeper stared at us with a suspicious look on his face, but, he didn’t bother saying anything and ended up letting us through.</p>
<p>「What are you standing there for? Come in.」</p>
<p>「Feel free to enjoy your stay.」</p>
<p>The prince and princess encouraged the other children to accompany them inside. After a bit of persuasion, they obliged and timidly followed the twins to the entrance.</p>
<p>「Well if it isn’t the prince. Welcome back to our humble lodging.」</p>
<p>We were greeted by the inn’s staff despite the fact that it was already really late into the night. On second thought though, I guess we should've expected it. We’re travelling with royalty, after all.</p>
<p>「And who would these children happen to be?」</p>
<p>「Simply put, a few things happened. Could you please prepare them rooms alongside hot water? I believe they will need baths.」</p>
<p>「Well…」</p>
<p>「Naturally, I will pay for their accommodations. You should be able to fulfill this request of mine, correct?」</p>
<p>「We apologize for any inconvenience that may cause. We are fully aware of how unreasonable our request may appear.」</p>
<p>「I doubt this will lead to any sort of complication. We’ll get everything ready immediately.」</p>
<p>Huh, you know, I don’t know what I should've expected. He really was a prince. He was able to deal with the inn’s staff without much issue despite the fact that they were adults and he wasn't. The princess, on the other hand, had acted and apologized in a more modest, understanding manner. Having the two work together like that kind of made it seem like they were applying some form of the carrot and stick principle.</p>
<p>「Whatever is this fuss about?」</p>
<p>「Good evening Serid. I’ve just returned.」</p>
<p>「Ah, if it isn’t the prince. I was quite concerned over your safety.」</p>
<p>「Thank you. I apologize for the trouble. Unfortunately, I failed to navigate the city’s streets and lost my way.」</p>
<p>「You lost your way, you say?」</p>
<p>「Indeed. I was only just able to return because Salrut had managed to discover my location.」</p>
<p>Naturally, the prince didn’t make even the slightest mention of getting caught and collared by slave traders.</p>
<p>「I see. And who exactly are these children? Did you perhaps choose to purchase yourself a group of slaves?」</p>
<p>「That would be incorrect. There are mere helpers, so to speak. They assisted me in navigating the city’s streets.」</p>
<p>「I see. In that case, your business with them should be over, should it not? You lot, leave this place immediately once you receive your payment.」</p>
<p>The man speaking to us looked like your typical, stuck up, piece of shit noble. He glared at us and the children in nothing but scorn.</p>
<p>「Serid! They are guests here, shut your mouth immediately.」</p>
<p>「What!? Prince, I shan’t accept that. Whatever are you thinking? Associating with these filthy peas-」</p>
<p>「Serid. I told you to be quiet. These children are my benefactors.」</p>
<p>「Tsk…」</p>
<p>Hah! Serves you right you piece of shit chamberlain! The twins are on our side, bitch!</p>
<p>Serid made one more hateful glare before turning around and leaving.</p>
<p>「Sorry about that. He’s pretty capable, but he lacks the ability to be flexible at times like these.」</p>
<p>「Don’t care.」</p>
<p>The children didn’t really seem to mind all that much either. Most nobles were like that, so they were used to it.</p>
<p>「What are your plans? You are more than free to stay the night if you wish.」</p>
<p>Salrut turned towards us with a generous offer.</p>
<p>『Sounds pretty good to me. I mean, it’s more than just a step up from a shabby little place that doesn’t even have a bath.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Will be in your care.」</p>
<p>「Splendid! I shall have a room prepared for you immediately after I inform the prince of this joyous matter.」</p>
<p>And so, we ended up spending a night at a super high class inn, all thanks to the prince.</p>

    < /br>

        
		<p><b>90. Isn’t it pretty easy to accidentally ingest the poison you keep in your molars?</b></p>
<p>We were provided an extravagant meal despite the fact that we arrived in the middle of the night. We, as guests, were presented with a rich, seafood soup, loads of soft buttered breads, and a massive chicken steak. And to top it all off, they prepared it so quickly that it was ready by the time Fran finished with her bath. Naturally, the children we rescued were also provided the exact same treatment.</p>
<p><span id="more-190"></span></p>
<p>Being subjected to all this really ingrained in me the fact that the inn was truly high class than anything else we'd ever experienced.</p>
<p>As a former middle aged man myself, I couldn’t help but think the meal to be a bit on the heavy side, but it seemed like it ended up being just right given how hungry the children were. They actually started out rather hesitant, but soon began to eat with as much vigour.</p>
<p>The twins continued to show their concerns throughout the meal. They asked each kid in turn if they had a place to call home. If the answer was a yes, they would promise to make arrangements for their safe return. If the answer was a no, they would promise to make sure that nothing bad would happen to them going forward. I honestly had a hard time believing that they were only 13 years old. They were way too mature for their ages.</p>
<p>What’s more was that both ended up lowering their heads to Fran in appreciation without so much as the slightest bit of unwillingness. Seeing the two of them act in the exact same manner at the exact same time really reinforced the idea that they were twins.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, the two introduced themselves in further detail. The prince was named Flut, and the princess Satia.</p>
<p>Fran seemed to take a liking to both of them, and happily answered all their questions, albeit in her usual, curt manner. Seeing her act like that put a smile on my face. To my knowledge, this was pretty much the first time Fran had ever gotten along with anyone else in her age group. And as far as my opinion went, that alone was more than enough to make this whole ordeal well worth it.</p>
<p>Fran’s room was a large and luxurious one bedroom suite the likes of which I’d never seen in person, not even in my past life. The chamber was decorated with a glamorous chandelier, a huge canopy, and even a ridiculously soft carpet. Seeing all these luxuries in person really made me wonder how much a night here would cost.</p>
<p>Oh what the hell! Both Fran and Urushi immediately dived straight into the bed! If we damaged or dirtied it, we’d probably end up paying compensation out the ass. In fact, I couldn’t even fathom its price.</p>
<p>Though, I do get where they were coming from. Even I wanted to try sleeping in it.</p>
<p>「Night.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>『Good night.』</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>And this is Master here, reporting in from the super luxurious inn’s attic in order to bring you details directly from the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>A single individual had infiltrated the premises, and was creeping around atop the building whilst concealing his presence. The assassin was dressed in all black. It didn’t look like he’d noticed me as of yet.</p>
<p>I cast Silence before knocking him unconscious with a bit of wind magic. I then captured him alive and brought him back over to Fran’s room.</p>
<p>『So I caught this assassin dude sneaking around on the rooftop.』</p>
<p>「Big catch.」</p>
<p>『Well, first, we should probably find out who he’s working for. We’ll hand him over to the prince after I guess.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The assassin we captured was human, so he probably didn’t have anything to do with the underground slave traders we busted earlier in the night. Oh well, whatever. We decided to hear what he had to say in either case. He might actually have something to do with the slave traders despite not being a member of the blue cat tribe.</p>
<p>Fran smacked the man in the face a few times to wake him up.</p>
<p>「Huh…? What…?」</p>
<p>「Awake?」</p>
<p>「W-What!? What did you do to me!?」</p>
<p>「Knocked out. Tied up.」</p>
<p>「When…!?」</p>
<p>「Few things to ask. Honest answers, less pain.」</p>
<p>「Growl growl growl.」</p>
<p>The man was currently stuck in a situation where he was bound by magic thread with a sword pointed to his face. To make matters worse, there was even a giant wolf staring him down.</p>
<p>He probably immediately understood that there was nothing he could do given his current circumstances.</p>
<p>「――tsk」</p>
<p>『Woah! He just poisoned himself.』</p>
<p>He must’ve had some poison hidden away in one of his molars. You know, isn’t keeping poison in your teeth kind of dangerous? I imagine it’d be pretty easy to swallow on accident. Or do they like go out of their way to practice not swallowing it or something?</p>
<p>Oh well, in either case, the man’s status changed. He was now badly poisoned, so it looked like he drank something pretty potent.</p>
<p>『Middle Heal.』</p>
<p>「Antidote.」</p>
<p>But all his effort went to waste. We had the perfect way to counteract his attempted suicide, and so we executed it. We rid his body of poison while restoring his HP back up to full.</p>
<p>「Too bad. Won’t work.」</p>
<p>「Impossible…! You managed to completely nullify my deadly poison!?」</p>
<p>「Good at healing.」</p>
<p>「Ugh…」</p>
<p>He didn’t give up and immediately bit his tongue off.</p>
<p>「Middle Heal.」</p>
<p>「Shit!」</p>
<p>「Like pain?」</p>
<p>In the end, the assassin told us everything he knew. It looked like he was prepared to die, but getting tortured ad infinitum was far outside what he could handle.</p>
<p>It turned out that he wasn’t connected to the slave traders in any which way. He was a freelance assassin who’d accepted a request to end both the prince and princess. He didn’t know who the request came from, but he was provided a set of instructions on how he could best infiltrate the inn.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>He was paid fully in advance, and as a result, he didn't know much about the person who made the request.</p>
<p>『Well, none of that information really pertained to us at all.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『Let’s hand him over to Salrut.』</p>
<p>「Urushi, keep watch.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Fran quickly called Salrut over. Though it was almost dawn, the knight yet to go to sleep. It looked like he’d been keeping watch all night.</p>
<p>「So this man is the assassin of which you speak?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Salrut questioned the assassin some more. The man already completely given up, so he pretty much answered every question he could. He didn't bother lying either.</p>
<p>「Hm… I can see that you seem to be speaking the truth, which leaves me to question the culprit’s identity.」</p>
<p>Salrut sank into a momentary bout of silence as he contemplated the assassin’s words. Chances were, he was probably considering a bunch of possible culprits, most of which we’d probably never even heard of.</p>
<p>「There is still much for me to consider, and as such, I will be taking this man into custody.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I shall discuss this topic with you in more detail some time tomorrow. I will further ensure that you are appropriate compensated for your actions. Please do look forward to it.」</p>
<p>「More interested in breakfast.」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! In that case, please enjoy it to your heart’s content.」</p>
<p>Fran quickly went to bed and didn’t wake up until sometime in the afternoon, after which she promptly to began the ever so difficult endeavor of eating both breakfast and lunch at the same time. Everyone that caught sight of the act was left with an expression of nothing but pure shock. She stuffed her cheeks with so much food that it almost made her seem more like a squirrel or hamster than a cat.</p>
<p>In fact, she ate so fast that it almost seemed like she was stuffing food into her dimensional storage as opposed to her throat. Witnessing her in the act made Salrut so surprised that his eyes turned as round as could be.</p>
<p>「So, Fran, did you happen to have any sort of schedule in mind?」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「Were you headed to any sort of particular destination?」</p>
<p>「Mmmphrphmm」</p>
<p>「Um… I apologize. I’ll wait until you’ve finished your meal.」</p>
<p>「Nnyu.」</p>
<p>All in all, Fran managed to devour about ten people's worth of food, a truly impressive amount. The prince seemed rather surprised, but he promptly spoke up again the moment she finished eating.</p>
<p>「I remember you saying you were on a journey, but I don’t really think you told me any more than just that. Are you planning to go somewhere specific?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Ulmutt.」</p>
<p>「By ship, I presume?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Via Barbra.」</p>
<p>「I see… So have you already arranged for boat tickets? I’m fairly certain that they’re all sold out by now given the number of people heading over for the Lunar Banquet.」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. Barbra’s Lunar Festival is one of Kranzel’s biggest.」</p>
<p>「It gets even livelier there than it does in the capital.」</p>
<p>The princess interjected with a knowing smile.</p>
<p>Huh, I had no idea. I guess that means we probably won’t be able to head to Barbra for a few days. I really should’ve figured that out ahead of time though, especially after seeing how flooded all the inns were. Man, I really wanted to have Fran be a part of it too. It was one of the country's biggest festivals, so I really didn't want her to miss out.</p>
<p>「Didn’t know.」</p>
<p>「Well, there is a way for you to find yourself a ship though.」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「We’d like to offer you a position as a guard, at least until we reach Barbra.」</p>
<p>「Naturally, we’ll pay you for your work. We’re planning on attending the banquet ourselves, so it goes without saying that we will arrive on time.」</p>
<p>We probably wouldn’t be able to find ourselves any decent ships if we went looking this late, and it’d be quite pitiable for Fran to have to part with her newfound friends after spending so little time with them. Besides, the prince’s ship was bound to be fairly luxurious, so all in all, I’d say we were offered a pretty sweet deal.</p>
<p>「Our biggest concern are the magic beasts we may encounter on our way.」</p>
<p>「Even with the knights?」</p>
<p>Apparently, a large magic beast had recently been spotted near the coast. Normally, the prince wouldn’t be concerned over magic beasts and the like, the one described in the reports was so enormous that it rendered him anxious.</p>
<p>And thus, he decided that more guards were necessary, and what better candidate was there than Fran? She was stronger than Salrut, and felt no fear even in the face of an assassin.</p>
<p>「Your highness, with all due respect, I’d like to request that you rescind your prior request! I simply cannot acknowledge you hiring her, we know nothing of her background!」</p>
<p>The prince’s chamberlain, Serid, couldn’t seem to stand for the thought of being in Fran's presence for much longer, as he immediately raised his voice and began to furiously protest the prince's decision.</p>
<p>But in the end, he was silenced. The prince glared at him, so he was given no choice but to sit his ass down and bear with his frustrations. That said, it didn't take long for him to begin peering over in our direction with a threatening look in his eyes.</p>
<p>(Master, accept?)</p>
<p>Sweet! Looks like Fran’s pretty eager to do this.</p>
<p>『Why not? We get our boat tickets, so I see no problems.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Job accepted.」</p>
<p>「Many thanks. We'll be counting on you.」</p>
<p>And so, we ended up deciding to escort the prince and princess to their destination.</p>

    < /br>

        
		<p><b>91. A Whole New World… of Fishing<br>
</b><br>
The weather was great.The sea was a beautiful shade of blue. The skies were clear, and the few clouds that remained were as white as marshmallows. Despite being a sword, I could almost feel the sun’s powerful ultraviolet rays assaulting my skin as the salty sea breeze gently passed by. This, <i>this</i> was what it truly meant to be at sea.</p>
<p><span id="more-193"></span></p>
<p>Fran, Urushi and I were currently aboard an incredibly luxurious ship, and I didn’t mean luxurious in the sense that it was a massive cruise liner or anything. In fact, it wasn’t all that big at all. However, its insides were decorated in as gaudy a manner as could be. All in all, it was probably at about the same level of luxury as the inn from which we just departed. Honestly though, I should've seen this coming. I don’t know what else I should’ve expected of a ship reserved for royalty.</p>
<p>Fran was enjoying this opportunity to its fullest. She was sitting on a wooden chair atop the ship's deck and basking in the sun to he heart's content. Her mind and body were both clearly in vacation mode, as evidenced by the class of juice sitting next to her.</p>
<p>That said, she was still making sure the ship was getting all the protection it needed… by ordering Urushi to do it in her place. Speaking of which, Urushi was currently on his way back to the ship. He had just defeated a fish-like magic beast, and was in the midst of retrieving it.</p>
<p>Urushi could leap through the air as he pleased and fire off dark magic instead of relying on melee combat, so he didn’t really end up getting soaked or anything. The only part of him that actually got wet was his face because he had to stick it into the water to pick up the magic beasts he defeated.</p>
<p>Well, the way I just said it made it sound kind of like Fran was doing nothing at all, but she was in fact still exerting a slight bit of effort from time to time. She would start casting spells if more than one magic beast attacked the ship simultaneously.</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>「Welcome back Urushi.」</p>
<p>『I’ll cut it up and stuff so we can eat it later.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『Y'know, I'm pretty content. I’ve managed to get quite a few magic stone points out of this.』</p>
<p>We’d only been on the boat for about half a day, but we’d already managed to kill 11 different magic beasts. Four kills belonged to Fran, and the other seven to Urushi.</p>
<p>The ship's crew had all been glaring at her in annoyance just earlier this morning as a result of her seemingly laid back attitude. They did warm up to her eventually though, as evidenced by the fact that they even went out of their way to thank her. Apparently, this was the first time they’d ever come across this many magic beasts without their ship being subjected to damage.</p>
<p>Serid was a bit more vocal about his complaints, but seeing Fran in action had left him with nothing to say with regards to her performance.</p>
<p>He didn’t stop trying to call her out though. I mean seriously, he was annoying as could be and pissed me the hell off on more than one occasion. During meal times, he wouldn’t shut up about how Fran didn’t have manners. She quickly got annoyed as well, so she activated Court Etiquette and put on a display as perfect as could be. Though Serid was still frustrated, he ultimately ran out of valid complaints and so, he ended up just sitting there and glaring at us in vexation. Observing him led me to believe that he and Salrut weren’t on good terms. We were quite friendly with Salrut, so he had likely identified us as a sort of natural enemy.</p>
<p>（Master. Afternoon snack.）</p>
<p>『Alright. Are you craving anything in particular?』</p>
<p>（Nnnn… Cookies.）</p>
<p>I hadn’t really made many sweets myself yet, so I decided to hand Fran the cookies we bought in Alessa. They came from a shop that sold most of its merchandise to nobles, so they were pretty tasty. That said, I personally still preferred the sweets we had back on earth. I should really sit down some time in the near future so I can mass produce stuff like cakes and pudding.</p>
<p>「Tasty.」</p>
<p>「Whine whine.」</p>
<p>『Don’t you worry Urushi, I’ve got something for you too.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>All the magic beasts we ran into were pretty weak, so both Fran and Urushi ended up being fairly relaxed. We sure did land ourselves one hell of a job. It felt like there were far more benefits than there was actual work.</p>
<p>There weren’t any other magic beasts for a while, so we spent a bit of time just dilly dallying around. That, however, changed once the princess came looking for us. As she approached, I couldn’t help but notice her long, blonde hair as it blew in the wind reflected the sun’s golden rays. Her blue eyes and westerner-like facial features were quite appealing to the eye. As of right now, she had a sort of cute charm, but as she matured, she would likely end up more on the beautiful side of the scale. [1]</p>
<p>Her features were a stark contrast to Fran’s, not to say that Fran wasn’t cute. She definitely was, it was just that she had short black hair and deep black eyes. It was like she was the princess’ opposite, and seeing them next to each other was kind of like seeing the sun next to the moon.</p>
<p>「Good afternoon Fran. We about to go fishing, would you like to join us?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Will join.」</p>
<p>After receiving the princess’s invitation, Fran followed her to the ship’s rear deck. There, we found Prince Flut, accompanied by three of the children we rescued. The girl and two boys by his side were the kids that didn’t have anywhere to go. The prince had proclaimed their encounter a sort fate, and decided that he would hire them all as servants.</p>
<p>The children had seemed to want to get to work right away, but the prince told them to treat him as just another one of their peers for the time being, seeing as they had yet to officially begin their training. The four of them seemed to be having a pretty good time, they were happily chatting away whilst holding their fishing rods in hand.</p>
<p>Children were unlike adults in the sense that they had yet to learn to discriminate between social classes, so it didn’t take for them to befriend both the prince and princess. The Serid faggot was already starting to get all bitchy again, but everyone more or less ended up ignoring him.</p>
<p>「Are you going to fish too, Fran?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Good at it.」</p>
<p>「Oh? Really?」</p>
<p>「Alright, then let’s have a fishing contest!」</p>
<p>「And we can all eat the fish we catch together!」</p>
<p>Fran was given a really fancy fishing rod. It was such an incredibly high quality product that it even had an automatic, magical reel.</p>
<p>The kids we saved didn’t seem to realize the item’s value, and happily just lobbed their lines into the sea without so much as a second glance. It didn’t take long for them to start landing fish. The fish that were reeled in were pretty much limited to sardine and marakel lookalikes, but regardless, the children soon began joyously comparing the size and relative rarities of their catches. Even the princess was all smiles despite the fact that she herself had opted to sit off to the side and observe as opposed to joining in.</p>
<p>The only one that had yet to catch anything was Fran, and as a result, the other children, the prince included, soon began to tease her.</p>
<p>「Whatever happened to being good at fishing?」</p>
<p>「You’re the only one that hasn’t caught anything yet.」</p>
<p>「Even I managed to land three!」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry! We’ll make sure we share some of ours with you.」</p>
<p>「Just wait. Ignoring small fry. Will net big catch.」</p>
<p>「Hahahaha! Good luck!」</p>
<p>I didn’t really see any problems with just going about this whole fishing thing like a normal person would, but Fran had insisted on trying to land something big.</p>
<p>The bait she was using was a Rockworm, a weak magic beast that we happened to have lying around. They didn’t really have use normally. Their shells would get all fragile when dried, and their meat stank and tasted like crap. The only part of them that we even bothered taking note of was their magic stones. It was kind of sad, but they normally only really saw use as compost. As a result, I happened to have a bunch sitting around in my storage just taking up space for no real reason.</p>
<p>Fran had taken one of the aforementioned Rockworms and chopped about a meter off its body. She then placed that severed section on a massive fishing hook and threw it out to sea. Using bait like that really limited what she could catch. The only things she could lure in were sharks, whales, and magic beasts. Thinking about it really made me wonder what she’d been trying to catch in the first place — not that it was of any real consequence. The only thing that really mattered was that she was having fun, which she was.</p>
<p>The status quo didn’t really change even after an hour. Each of the children had managed to fish up ten or so different fish, but Fran had yet to catch anything.</p>
<p>At first, they’d teased her about being unable to catch anything, but their expressions had gradually changed over the course of the activity. They'd even started hoping that she would soon land a bite.They seemed to have the wrong idea. They thought that her silence and lack of an expression was due to something along the lines of idea, when really, that was just how she was.</p>
<p>Fran actually didn’t mind her lack of a catch at all. In fact, she was rather happy as a result of the peaceful atmosphere.</p>
<p>But then it finally happened. The atmosphere crumbled in an instant as the moment Fran had been awaiting finally arrived.</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Nice! You got a bite!」</p>
<p>「Woah, it’s pulling super hard!」</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>「It must be really big!」</p>
<p>The children started cheering. They seemed as happy as they were when they themselves got bites.</p>
<p>The fishing rod started to bend out of shape. Despite being what was likely one of the highest quality fishing rods in the world, it was forced to bend as far as it could go. Chances were that Fran had probably caught something on the scale of a marlin.</p>
<p>「Mgrrhhhh!」</p>
<p>「You can do it! Go go!」</p>
<p>「Reel it in! Reel it in!!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran was using every last bit of her strength to pull the fish in, but her prey was pulling back with just as much force. Despite her efforts, the reel continued to spin and the line continued to lengthen. Seeing her like that reminded me of a show I saw on TV once. If I recall correctly, it was called Fishing the Seven Seas… or something like that.</p>
<p>「Nnnnnn!!!!」</p>
<p>「Keep it up!」</p>
<p>「Don’t let it get away!」</p>
<p>To be honest, I probably could’ve given Fran a hand. I could’ve weakened it a bit without catching anyone’s attention. It would’ve been pretty easy to tire it out with magic and make it feel all drowsy or something.</p>
<p>But I refrained.</p>
<p>This was Fran’s battle, something she should take care of on her own.</p>
<p>Fran struggled with the fish for more than thirty minutes. Obvious signs of exhaustion had started to show on her face.</p>
<p>The process had ultimately ended up as something more akin to trawling than fishing. She merely pulled her catch along as the ship continued to sail.</p>
<p>Her arms had already started to go numb, so she gave up on winning with nothing but brute force and instead relied on her skills.</p>
<p>She began by activating Thunder Blade. The expensive fishing rod was instantly cloaked in a coat of electricity. She then quickly used water magic alongside current control, and started to pull her prey towards the ship whilst activating Herculean Strength and a whole bunch of different support spells. She was going for one last spurt.</p>
<p>It took her ten minutes to finally drag the fish from the ocean’s depths. It’s form wasn’t fully visible, but we could see a giant, ten meter long shadow lurking beneath the water’s surface. The fish she’d caught was literally twice Urushi’s size.</p>
<p>「Wow! What is that!?」</p>
<p>「W-Wow Fran! Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Holy moly!」</p>
<p>The children immediately kicked up a fuss, but Fran paid them no heed as she continued to singlemindedly reel her prey in. The air around her would periodically crackle with electricity because she had kept Thunder Blade active the whole time.</p>
<p>That said, the fish had really put up one hell of a struggle. There was no way it was just a normal fish. Knowing that, I decided to give it a quick appraisal.<br>

<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>Its head is covered with a substance as hard as mithril. Its name is derived from the fact that it can destroy battleships by ramming them with its skull. It is classified as a D level threat if within the ocean, and an E level threat under all other conditions. Its flesh is said to be an extremely luxurious delicacy. Its magic stone is in its head.<br>
_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>『Watch out Fran. It’s a magic beast, and a pretty strong one at that.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran immediately hit the Dreadnought Destroyer with a mix of wind magic and sheer brute force; its body was sent flying up into the air.</p>
<p>「Woah!!」</p>
<p>「Kyah!」</p>
<p>「Holy!」</p>
<p>The giant magic beast immediately fell towards the ship and caused both the children and sailors to scream in panic.</p>
<p>『The ship will probably take a lot of damage if you let the Tuna fall on top of it.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran immediately used magic detection to find the giant fish’s magic stone and threw me at it with all her might.</p>
<p>「Haa!」</p>
<p>She accelerated me even further through the use of wind magic, so I pierced through the fish’s hard skull with ease.</p>
<p>She then cast more wind magic and caught its corpse before it crashed into the ship. She then gently laid it on the deck. The fish was at least twelve meters long from head to tail. In fact, it was so long that its tailfin actually hung off the side of the ship; its length was greater than our luxury liner’s width.</p>
<p>「Fishing contest. My win.」</p>
<p>「Er… Um….」</p>
<p>「That uh….」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>Fran began dismantling the fish despite the fact that the children and crew were still in the midst of a confused uproar. Well, I say dismantle, but all she really did was cut off its head and fillet it.</p>
<p>『Fran, what are you doing?』</p>
<p>（Promised to share.）</p>
<p>『Oh, yeah. Right.』</p>
<p>And so, Fran continued to quickly and efficiently dismantle the giant fish. The sailors hadn’t been aware at how proficient she was at dismantling, so they couldn’t help but end up staring in awe.</p>
<p>I've emphasized this multiple times already, but the fish really was massive. In fact, it was so big that we could probably feed over a hundred people with just the delicious fatty stomach part itself. That thought was probably precisely why the ship’s crew had yet to calm down. They were probably all excited because of the fact that there was a massive amount of a super high class delicacy right before their eyes.</p>
<p>They continued to make a fuss throughout the dismantling process. Silence didn’t come until quite a bit after Fran put the head and bones away inside her dimensional storage.</p>
<p>「I knew that Fran was strong, but I never would have fathomed that she would be <i>this</i> strong…」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! You’ve beat me by a mile. The fishing content belongs to you.」</p>
<p>「How incredible! She really is much stronger than Salrut!」</p>
<p>「Delicious!」</p>
<p>「S-So this is how a Dreadnought Destroyer tastes…」</p>
<p>「I’m going to eat a whole lifetime’s worth!」</p>
<p>The ship soon started to get noisy again as we started handing out cuts of tuna. We gave the sailors a share as well, so the whole ship was soon filled with a sort of party like atmosphere. Everyone was happy, which made sense. It wasn't everyday that you'd get your hands on a delicacy this delicious, after all.</p>
<p>「Hey, thanks for the meal.」</p>
<p>Even the captain came up to offer us his thanks.</p>
<p>「My name is Rengil. Would you mind me asking yours?」</p>
<p>「Fran.」</p>
<p>「And I assume you’re an adventurer?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Rank D adventurer.」</p>
<p>Fran flashing her guild card caused the ship to stir with noise yet again. Very few had ever achieved D rank at an age as young as hers.</p>
<p>「I expected nothing less. In fact, I was expecting you to be of a higher rank given your abilities. I was quite surprised that you managed to defeat Dreadnought Destroyer with such ease. In any case, I would like to offer you a token of appreciation.」</p>
<p>Captain Rengil took something out of his chest pocket and handed it to Fran.</p>
<p>「What’s this?」</p>
<p>「That coin right there has the Lucielle Conglomerate’s coat of arms engraved on it. The company’s head office is in Barbra, and showing them that coin should earn you quite a few conveniences going forward.」</p>
<p>「The Lucielle Conglomerate is one of Kranzel’s leading corporations, and evidently, one of its executives has just taken a liking to you. How truly impressive!」</p>
<p>The prince explained that the coin we’d received was actually something really worthwhile, as it meant that a massive company had our backs. I really had to give it to the captain. He had a pretty good eye for adventurers.</p>
<p>「You sure?」</p>
<p>「Of course. In fact, I’d say it’s worth very little compared to what we would obtain out of networking with an adventurer with as much potential as you.」</p>
<p>The sailors began string up yet another storm the moment their captain finished speaking. This time around, all of them were praising Fran without the slightest bit of reserve.</p>
<p>「Man, she even managed to catch the captain’s eye.」</p>
<p>「Well yeah. Look at how young she is! She’s already rank D at <i>that </i>age!」</p>
<p>「She defeated the Dreadnought Destroyer with ease too.」</p>
<p>「And she’s cute.」</p>
<p>「Dude, what the hell!? You were a pedo!?」</p>
<p>「N-No way man! That’s not what I meant!」</p>
<p>「I would like to encourage you to visit our headquarters in Barbra at least once. It will be well worth your time.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The captain gave one last bow before turning around and heading back to his position. Likewise, the crew members passed by one by one and thanked Fran in turn. As a result, the three children ended up looking at her with gazes tainted with an ever so slight bit of envy.</p>
<p>「You’re amazing Fran!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Of course.」</p>
<p>「I’m going to become just as strong as you are!」</p>
<p>「Good luck.」</p>
<p>「Lemme see the coin!」</p>
<p>Fran’s finally made real friends! And she’s hanging out with them too!</p>
<p>Just seeing her like that made me wish that the moment would last in perpetuity.</p>
<p>But my hopes were crushed, as the sailor keeping watch immediately began to shout.</p>
<p>「P-Pirate ship spotted!!」</p>

		<p><b>92. Special Attack! Monolith Buster Crash!</b></p>
<p>「P-Pirate ship spotted!!」</p>
<p>The ship’s crew began the panic the moment they heard the watchman’s shout. Likewise, the children immediately stopped eating and instead began looking around with anxious looks on their faces.</p>
<p><span id="more-202"></span></p>
<p>Seriously? Fuck those shit eating retards! Fran was just starting to relax and have fun! I was <b>NOT </b>going to let them get away with this.</p>
<p>The twins immediately went to go get the captain, who proceeded to explain the situation.</p>
<p>「It looks like we're about to be attacked by a fleet of pirates」</p>
<p>「Fleet? How many?」</p>
<p>「Eight ships in total.」</p>
<p>Huh, that’s actually a pretty decent number.</p>
<p>「What do you think of our chances of breaking through and escaping?」</p>
<p>「I’m afraid it’s not possible. They’ve many a speedboat.」</p>
<p>「Then shall we fight?」</p>
<p>「With all due respect, your highness, I wish for you and your sister to board a lifeboat and escape.」</p>
<p>「Would it not be possible to fit us all on the aforementioned lifeboat?」</p>
<p>「We would fit, but most of us will need to stay behind in order to fight the pirates and thereby draw their attention. The plan is currently to have your highnesses escape alongside the children and a few select others.」</p>
<p>「I refuse to to allow that to happen. I cannot allow myself to escape whilst making sacrifices of my retainers.」</p>
<p>「I too support my brother’s sentiments. We refuse to escape by ourselves.」</p>
<p>If I was still human, I likely would’ve nodded my head in approval. I liked the way the prince and princess thought. Normally, this kind of situation would resolve itself by having a few subordinates act as decoys while they escaped. In fact, I’d go as far as to say that escaping with their lives was precisely their duty as royalty. The only possible way to describe the two royals currently protesting that exact action was that they were naive.</p>
<p>But that was fine. I rather liked them, and I didn’t really think there was any sort of issue with royalty acting the way they did.</p>
<p>「I am also against the idea.」</p>
<p>「You too Serid? I see you understand the value in having us all escape together.」</p>
<p>「I am against that idea as well. My belief is that we would do best to surrender.」</p>
<p>「What!? You fool! How can you possibly even consider the idea of surrender!?」</p>
<p>Salrut roared in anger in response to Serid’s sudden suggestion.</p>
<p>「We cannot best them in combat.」</p>
<p>「And that is precisely why we should allow the prince and princess to escape while we buy them the time they require!」</p>
<p>「So you mean to say that you believe the two of them will be able to navigate the ocean and safely return home in nothing but a miniscule rowboat? It would be much more favourable to declare the highness’ identities and surrender. Pirates are crude, but it would be but nonsensical for them to go out of their ways to make enemies our country. I can assure that the pirates will not harm the prince nor princess, but instead, demand ransom as compensation for their safeties. There is no reason for us to resist. Resisting will do nothing more than anger our enemies and eliminate any potential means for negotiation.」</p>
<p>His proposal did seem like it was supported by a decent amount of logic, but things probably wouldn’t go as smoothly as he thought they would.</p>
<p>「Your proposal is ridiculous! I refuse to acknowledge its viability.」</p>
<p>「Learn your place, Salrut. A mere knight like you has no right to participate in this conversation.」</p>
<p>「I am their highness’ guard. I have the right to act according to my discretion in times of need.」</p>
<p>「How impudent you are. Did you perhaps think that being promoted to their highness’ guard provides you the right to argue against <i>me</i>?」</p>
<p>「Impudence plays no part in this ordeal! My duty is but to protect, and that is precisely what I am attempting to do.」</p>
<p>「Silence foreigner! You are nothing, a mere dog picked up by the queen upon a whim! I have more than enough reason to doubt the truth of your words.」</p>
<p>「I see that you’ve stooped to the level of insults now, Serid.」</p>
<p>「And for what reason would I not? You are but encouraging a measure that would bring more risk to their highness’ than necessary. Truly, I have begun to doubt your motives. Did you <i>really </i>take flight from the Kingdom of Reidos? Is that but a pretense? A lie? Is it not possible, or rather, likely, for you to be merely aiming for our country’s Godblade? I think it so.」</p>
<p>「Godblade? In possession?」</p>
<p>Fran joined in on the conversation happening between the two old men because her ears caught something that grabbed her attention.</p>
<p>「I-Indeed. Our country is in possession of a single Godblade.」</p>
<p>「Don’t you dare call the Fyrias Kingdom your country, you damned Raidosian!」</p>
<p>「I dare you to repeat those words!」</p>
<p>And so, the two old men started arguing once again. Ew.</p>
<p>You know, thinking about it, aren’t they like, kind of wasting a lot of time doing this?</p>
<p>『They’re being a bit of a pain in the ass right, so what do you say to fixing their pirate problem, Fran? They’ll probably tell us more about the Godblade if you ask later anyways.』</p>
<p>（Nn. Good idea.）</p>
<p>『Man, why did this have to happen in the middle of a meal anyways…』</p>
<p>（Sushi. Tasty.）</p>
<p>『Urushi, stay here and guard the prince and princess, alright?』</p>
<p>（Woof!）</p>
<p>（Save sushi. I want.）</p>
<p>（Bark!）</p>
<p>『Oh, did you end up taking a liking to it?』</p>
<p>（Nn. Only second to curry. Tasty.）</p>
<p>Welp, still doesn’t match up to her beloved curry apparently.</p>
<p>「Wait, Fran, where are you going?」</p>
<p>「Nn? Sinking enemies.」</p>
<p>「What? Wait! You’re acting far too recklessly!」</p>
<p>The prince tried to stop Fran by grabbing ahold of her, but she easily dodged and stepped up onto the ship’s railing.</p>
<p>「Be right back.」</p>
<p>And with that line, she leapt.</p>
<p>「Kyaaa! Fran!」</p>
<p>「Fran!」</p>
<p>The children rushed up to the ship’s railing in haste. They’d assumed that she had dived into the ocean, but yeah, no. Not even Fran could board a pirate ship with ease if she had to swim up to it first. And that was why they didn’t see her swimming when they peaked over the deck. Instead, they were greeted by a rather peculiar sight. Fran was using magic to hop through the air.</p>
<p>「Woah!」</p>
<p>「That’s amazing!」</p>
<p>「Fran’s flying!」</p>
<p>I activated telekinesis and let her get on top of me. To the children, it looked as if she was surfing through the air.</p>
<p>It took us about thirty seconds to get up above the pirate ships. The flag they had raised was one with a skull inscribed upon it. In other words, the people we were about to fight were the pirate equivalent of basic bitches.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>The only notable thing about the ships was that they had already sustained a fair amount of damage. It almost looked as if the pirates had just finished fighting another battle. One of the ships even had a giant hole in its side.</p>
<p>『The hell’s up with that?』</p>
<p>「Don’t know.」</p>
<p>『Oh well, whatever. They have their cannons prepped and stuff, so I guess can’t just ignore that one or anything.』</p>
<p>「Sink biggest last?」</p>
<p>『Sure, why not?』</p>
<p>「Nn. Starting now.」</p>
<p>『Er wait a sec, hold on. Why don’t we actually try going for that one first?』</p>
<p>「Biggest?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, I want to check if that’s the one their captain’s on. I also want to ask them a few things before we sink them all.』</p>
<p>「Understood.」</p>
<p>And so, we ended up attacking the ship that looked like the flagship first. The pirates onboard could do nothing but stare at us with their mouths gaping as we readied our assault.</p>
<p>「Starting.」</p>
<p>『Go for it. Make sure you don’t kill the captain though.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran leapt off of me, grabbed me on her way down, and immediately killed every pirate in her vicinity as she landed.</p>
<p>What happened afterwards was more or less a slaughter. Every single movement Fran made resulted in the death of a pirate. There were a few half decent fighters, but not a single one of them was even anywhere remotely close to a match for Fran. Their ranged options were completely nullified as well. None of the arrows or spells they loosed could pierce Fran’s magic barrier.</p>
<p>「W-who the hell are you!?」</p>
<p>「Adventurer.」</p>
<p>「Shit! This is fucking insane!」</p>
<p>「Die bitch!」</p>
<p>「No.」</p>
<p>「Gyaaahhh!」</p>
<p>It took us but a few moments to defeat every single pirate aboard the ship save for the captain.</p>
<p>「Damned monster!」</p>
<p>Oh what the fuck. I hate this guy already.</p>
<p>（Master. Not content?）</p>
<p>『Well yeah. Just look at what he’s wearing.』</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>What the hell kind of pirate was he supposed to be!? He didn’t have any eyepatches, he didn’t have any wooden limbs, and he didn’t have any hooks, like what the hell! He didn’t even have a goddamn hat with a goddamn skull on it either! He’s literally not even a real pirate. Like come on! I was hoping he would look like Captain Hook, or maybe even Jack Sp*rrow, but no! This little shit doesn’t look like a pirate at all! Like what the fuck was this!? I feel fucking scammed!</p>
<p>『He’s literally dressed the exact same as any run of the mill warrior!』</p>
<p>The captain was wearing normal plate armour with a normal helmet. There was nothing interesting about his appearance at all. Well, I mean he did at least have a cape, and his armour was pretty high quality, but he looked literally nothing like the captain of a crew of pirates. I never would’ve even guessed it to be him. The only reason I knew was because I used appraisal.</p>
<p>「Damn you! Let go of me! Let go of me right this instant!」</p>
<p>Fran lifted the pirate as I voiced my complaints. Seeing a cute, little girl like her lift a huge, bulky man was kind of off putting actually.</p>
<p>『Oh whatever… Let’s just get the questioning and shit over with.』</p>
<p>（What to ask?）</p>
<p>『Ask him if he’s the one that commands the whole fleet.』</p>
<p>And so, we began to interrogate the pirate. Fran asked the questions while I figured out whether or not they were true by running them through the Principle of Falsehood.</p>
<p>The results of our interrogation were as follows: he was the fleet’s boss, they had a base with more guys there, and that they didn’t have any treasure because they’d only just left.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask the captain a few more questions, but we ran out of time. The other nearby ships had begun bombarding the one we were on despite the fact that their captain was still alive. How heartless.</p>
<p>「Those sons of bitches betrayed me!」</p>
<p>I’m not sure what he expected. They’d probably just end up getting a new boss if he died anyways.</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s go destroy all the other ships.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Gyuke！」</p>
<p>Fran gave the captain’s neck a chop and knocked him unconscious. For some odd reason, he let out a really wierd noise as it happened. Moreover, his mouth had began to foam, and his eyes had completely rolled back into his head.</p>
<p>『The hell was that?』</p>
<p>「Nn? Cool effect. Good hit.」</p>
<p>『Eh, oh well whatever. We can let him live if you want. Just like roll him up and bring him with us or something.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Going.」</p>
<p>A second bombardment assaulted us as Fran picked up the captain and got back on top of me. They seemed to be aiming at us, but they couldn’t seem to hit because of how small of a target we were relative to what they were used to.</p>
<p>「Activating now.」</p>
<p>Fran activated her dimensional storage as she got above the other ships. This time, however, she wasn’t actually putting anything inside of it. Quite the opposite, in fact. Remember those giant rocks we happened to pick up the other day?</p>
<p>『Fuahahaha! Take this! Monolith Buster Crash!』</p>
<p>（Nn?）</p>
<p>『Er, it’s nothing. Don’t worry about it.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The pirates were clearly thrown into a state of disorder. Well, can’t really blame them. A rock the size of their ship literally just appeared out of thin air.</p>
<p>Doing this allowed us to get rid of the giant rocks we had sitting around for no reason while also sinking the enemy’s ships in one go. It was truly an application of the classic two birds one stone concept.</p>
<p>Honestly, we probably could’ve just dumped the rocks in the ocean earlier, but doing that would’ve made it seem like I was illegally dumping garbage or something, so I felt kinda guilty about it despite the fact that I probably wouldn’t have been reprimanded for it anyway. This, however, made me feel pretty good if anything.</p>
<p>The dull sound of wood being torn to shreds rang throughout the seas the moment the rock hit the ship. This sound was immediately followed by a louder, metallic impact and then finally a series of screams. And that was that. The ship snapped in half and sank into the ocean.</p>
<p>「Next?」</p>
<p>『Hell yeah!』</p>
<p>We did the same thing to the other ships as well. The pirates tried shooting us down with magic and arrows, but their shots were too scattered and failed to accomplish much of anything at all given that all their attacks were completely negated by Fran’s magical barrier.</p>
<p>It took us less than five minutes to sink all eight pirate ships. Naturally, the flag ship was given the exact same treatment as the rest, and so, we managed to get rid of two thirds of the rocks we had in storage.</p>
<p>『Alright, that’s that. Let’s head back over to the ship.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>

    < /br>

        
		<p><b>93. Suspicion<br>
</b></p>
<p>「Just how selfish can you possibly get!?」</p>
<p>Serid began to yell in his usual, loud manner the moment we got back to the ship.</p>
<p><span id="more-207"></span></p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「What were you doing!? You attacked the enemy without awaiting even the slightest bit of consent!」</p>
<p>「No problem. Sank all enemies.」</p>
<p>「She does have a point. I fail to see any issue, Serid.」</p>
<p>「You fail to see any issue!? She engaged the enemy by her lonesome and thereby neglected her duty to protect the prince! That, <i><b>that</b></i> is the issue!」</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like he was going to be satisfied regardless of what Fran did. My guess was that he was likely acting like this in order to try to belittle her achievement or something.</p>
<p>「I will admit that you deserve some praise, as you accomplished the feat of sinking an entire fleet of pirates by your lonesome. However, the method you employed was nothing short of inconsiderate. Your assault caused wave after wave to batter our ship. We were sent into such a state of disarray that the vessel even capsized. We managed through the application of water based magics, but regardless, you very evidently put their highnesses in harm’s way!」</p>
<p>Okay, you know what? I take that back. I’ll admit I messed up. I never even considered that we might end up hitting our allies.</p>
<p>『We should probably apologize.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Sorry.」</p>
<p>「Hmph. I mind it not so long as you understand the consequences of your actions.」</p>
<p>Oh god damn it. Now he’s got this cocky look on his face. It really makes me want to hit him..</p>
<p>「Ugh….」</p>
<p>「Woke up?」</p>
<p>The pirate we brought back to the ship had awoken. All the excess noise Serid made had probably forced his unconscious mind back into the realm of sentience.</p>
<p>「W-What the!? Where the hell am I?」</p>
<p>「On ship.」</p>
<p>「What happened to my subordinates?」</p>
<p>「Sank.」</p>
<p>『So they’re dead in the water?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Explain yourself! What exactly are the two of you discussing?」</p>
<p>Serid immediately yelled in an irritated tone as a result of the fact that Fran had started casually talking to the pirate.</p>
<p>「Is that one of the pirates?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Interrogating.」</p>
<p>「Then hand him over. This task will be mine. Guards!」</p>
<p>「Sir!」</p>
<p>A nearby soldier immediately adhered to Serid’s orders. He grabbed the pirate’s arm and immediately lifted him to his feet. I didn’t get what he was doing. Was he trying to steal all Fran’s glory? And where was he going to move him?</p>
<p>「Taking him? Where?」</p>
<p>「I will bring him to my cabin for the purposes of interrogation. I forbid you all from joining me in the endeavor.」</p>
<p>「I’ll interrogate.」</p>
<p>「You think I could possibly leave a task as important as this in <i>your</i> hands?」</p>
<p>Okay no. That made literally no sense at all. Firstly, he wasn’t the one who captured the pirate, and secondly, he wasn’t letting us so much as observe his interrogations. Like what the hell! I can’t tell if this is just another form of harassment, or if he’s going to ask about something that he didn’t want the rest of us to hear. Either way, he was being overly suspicious.</p>
<p>Seeing his actions reminded me about the whole thing with the assassin. I was pretty sure that someone had helped the assassin sneak in, most notably someone with the power to sway the inn’s guards to such an extent that they would create a sort of opening in their defense net. Moreover, it was a bit weird that the ship we were on didn’t have any sort of escort. I know that we were currently aboard a vessel that prioritized speed and all that, but it really shouldn’t have gone effortless given that we had royalty on board.</p>
<p>Thinking about it quickly made me realize that Serid probably had enough power to arrange both the aforementioned oddities.</p>
<p>Throwing more facts into the pool only made him seem even more suspicious. The only problem was that I didn’t have any sort of evidence. We could just say that one of skills allowed us to see through lies, but, there wasn’t any way for us to prove that we really had that skill, so it had no function as far as evidence went. We could torture him until he decided to confess his wrongdoings, but that wasn’t exactly what I’d call the best evidence either.</p>
<p>Fran and Serid’s underlings had began glaring at each other as I thought things through.</p>
<p>The situation was starting to look bad, but, the tense atmosphere was suddenly broken by the pirate as he let loose a fearless laugh.</p>
<p>「Hahahaha! Well, if it isn’t the Fyrias Kingdom’s chamberlain. Don’t think I don’t know exactly who you are, Serid.」</p>
<p>「W-What are you…」</p>
<p>「I may be a pirate, but I’m no fool. Even seafarers like us have more than enough of an intelligence network to figure out exactly who our clients are — regardless of whether or not said clients are landlubbers like you.」</p>
<p>Okay, woah. Did he just say that Serid was one of his clients? That's not something I can just hear and leave be.</p>
<p>「E-Enough of your nonsense! Someone silence this madman immediately.」</p>
<p>One of Serid’s soldiers raised his blade, but Fran moved in between him and the pirate before he could swing it.</p>

<p>「Want to hear more.」</p>
<p>「He is but rambling! There is nothing to hear.」</p>
<p>「Will judge after hearing.」</p>
<p>「Are you perhaps attempting to frame me for colluding with the pirates? Unacceptable! Guards! Arrest her immediately!」</p>
<p>「Serid, what in the world are you thinking!?」</p>
<p>「I-I am but ordering the arrest of one who has committed the act of treason! She is attempting to frame me for collusion, of which I had no part! Do not interfere! I will ensure that the sin also falls upon your shoulders if you try to so much as assist her!」</p>
<p>That’s a nice excuse he’s got there.</p>
<p>It seemed that Serid was still underestimating Fran because of her appearance. He most likely thought she was a mage given the attacks he’d just witnessed, so he probably assumed the soldiers could take her close combat.</p>
<p>「Drop swords in less than 10 seconds. Will forgive.」</p>
<p>「Y-You think you can beat us, little girl?」</p>
<p>「We have you surrounded! It’s your loss.」</p>
<p>Fran raised me and readied herself for combat, but Serid’s soldiers continued to look down on her despite that. They had stayed within the ship’s interior throughout the trip’s duration, so they knew little of her abilities and even less of Urushi’s. They had assumed that she had used spells or magic tools to crush the pirate ships, so they thought they could best her so long as they stopped her from chanting.</p>
<p>The prince, however, more than understood the extent of Fran’s strength. He was worried for the soldier’s lives, and so he quickly positioned himself in the middle of the encirclement. The expression he had on his face clearly indicated that he went in knowing the consequences, and that he was prepared for death should it come.</p>
<p>「Lower your swords, all of you! Serid, what sort of fool are you?」</p>
<p>「I am but subjugating a rebel, Your Highness.」</p>
<p>「You cannot best Fran. Soldiers, lower your swords lest you bear a deathwish.」</p>
<p>「Hah hah hah! What an intriguing joke, your highness. Do you truly believe that our country’s soldiers would lose to such a small, pathetic child?」</p>
<p>「I do!」</p>
<p>「Prince, I see that I must prove you wrong and reestablish your faith in our countrymen. The Fyrias Kingdom’s soldiers are men of valour, and now, they shall demonstrate that precise fact. It is but a shame that their foe is a mere girl.」</p>
<p>「C-Cease this right this instant!」</p>
<p>「Do not heed the prince’s orders! Do it!」</p>
<p>「Sir! Yes sir!」</p>
<p>The soldiers chose to obey Serid over the prince. They immediately rushed Fran down in order to attack. Their faces gave away that they weren’t actually intent on killing her; at most, they wanted a limb or two. Moreover, their movements indicated that they were fairly proficient at combat.</p>
<p>「Can’t be helped.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>But they were no match for Fran, and so, the battle ended in an instant. Fran cut down two of them, I sent two more flying with magic, and Urushi pinned down another. All of the men that had opposed us had collapsed, save for Serid.</p>
<p>「I-Impossible… How could it be!」</p>
<p>Fran completely ignored the now stiffened up chamberlain and instead turned to face the pirate.</p>
<p>「Explain everything.」</p>
<p>「I’ll tell you whatever you want if you agree to let me live.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Agreed. Will spare.」</p>
<p>「Heh, alright. The deal is sealed.」</p>
<p>「First. Involvement with Serid.」</p>
<p>「He offered us a job. So basically, he’s one of our clients.」</p>
<p>「Shut your mouth immediately, you lia-」</p>
<p>「Shut up.」</p>
<p>「Geh!」</p>
<p>Serid tried to cut the pirate off and stop him from talking, but Fran gave him a quick smack and knocked him out. Well, that’s one less source of noise.</p>
<p>「And?」</p>
<p>「E-Er, right. It happened sometime in the evening two days ago.」</p>
<p>Apparently the pirates had a secret base set up somewhere in Dharz. They often used it to buy supplies and gather information. Someone had purposefully sought out said base in order to hire them for something.</p>
<p>Specifically, they were asked to attack the ship we were on. They were told that the Fryias Kingdom would have a few members of its royal family on the boat. Their job was to kidnap and murder those precise individuals. Moreover, arrangements would be made so that the ship would remain without any sort of armed escort, and it was even said that the people on board would surrender immediately.</p>
<p>「Client was Serid?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. It was one hell of a dirty job, but so we did a bit of investigating. Tracking the requestor informed us that he was one of that old fox’s subordinates.」</p>
<p>「Accepted?」</p>
<p>「Well, we were going to get paid a ridiculous amount, and we figured we could threaten Serid and get him to pay up even more. So yes, we did.」</p>
<p>Alright, so my guesses are on this whole thing being a part of a power struggle, but why go so far just to kill the twins? I mean, they were sixth and seventh in the line of succession. They weren't even anywhere near the throne.</p>
<p>It looked like we were going to need to dig a little bit deeper if we wanted to figure out exactly what was going on.</p>

		<p><b>94. Not All People with Bad Personalities are Necessarily Evil</b></p>
<p>「Up.」</p>
<p>「Guah!」</p>
<p>Fran gave Serid’s back a good stomp. The sudden influx of pain caused the chamberlain to awaken. The combination of his aching back and Fran’s cold gaze left him feeling a sense of intimidation.</p>
<p><span id="more-211"></span></p>
<p>「W-What is it?」</p>
<p>「Why kill Flut and Satia?」</p>
<p>「I-I fail to grasp the essence of your question.」</p>
<p>「Pirate blabbed. Said Serid was mastermind.」</p>
<p>「What you mean to say is that you believe the ramblings of a mere pirate?」</p>
<p>He’s still saying that? My guess was that he wanted to abuse his authority and push everything under the rug or something, but that didn’t seem all that feasible given the current circumstances.</p>
<p>「Hired Pirates. Murder Flut and Satia.」</p>
<p>「I would never!」</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>（Master, problem?）</p>
<p>『No, it’s nothing. Keep interrogating him.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Why do you want them dead?」</p>
<p>「I have not the slightest clue!」</p>
<p>Huh, wow. He isn’t lying.</p>
<p>「How did you make the blue cat tribe move? Slave Merchants.」</p>
<p>「Blue cat tribe? I understand not what you are saying…」</p>
<p>「Assassin at the inn. Where did you hire? When?」</p>
<p>「You speak but of nonsense… Wait! You said that an assassin had appeared at the inn!?」</p>
<p>It looked he he really didn’t know anything. Well, I mean I get the whole incident with the blue cat tribe’s slave merchants because he was literally never informed of it. But I never would’ve expected him not to know of the assassin either.</p>
<p>Wait, so what exactly is going on? Why do the pirates think that he was the one who hired them despite him thinking otherwise?</p>
<p>「Which subordinate contacted pirates?」</p>
<p>「I have already stated that I have not the slightest idea. Cease with this farce immediately! I know precisely your plans, you wished to accuse me of treason from the very beginning.」</p>
<p>He was actually being a hundred percent serious. He isn’t lying at all, which could mean that he actually didn’t have any part in this… not that I can actually believe that.</p>
<p>「Do not take me for a fool. I can clearly see that this is not but a scenario written by that detestable Raidosian spy.」</p>
<p>「I cannot believe that to be true, Serid. Salrut is one of our mother’s, the queen’s knights. He is a man that has earned her trust.」</p>
<p>「Her Majesty’s trust in him is based but in deception.」</p>
<p>Serid’s reply to the prince evidenced that he truly believed Salrut to be a spy.</p>
<p>Okay, this is looking bad. I seriously have no idea what’s even going on anymore.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s think this all over.</p>
<p>The slipped out, and as a result, they managed to get themselves kidnapped by the blue cat tribe’s illegal slave traders. They were about to get shipped off to Reidos so they could be sold as merchandise, but then we stepped in and saved them. That task would likely have fallen onto Salrut’s shoulders had we not shown up that night. It looked like this wasn’t the first time this’d happened. The twins seemed to have made sneaking out a sort of habit, and it’d probably be even easier for them to actually manage to escape if the guards had a hole in their security net. Serid definitely had more than enough power to arrange for such a hole.</p>
<p>The next thing to consider would be the assassin we handed off to Salrut. The person who hired him had tipped him off so that he’d be able to infiltrate the building with ease. The assassin probably needed a map to actually sneak in. He also would’ve needed to know where all the guards were. Again, Serid could’ve easily provided all that information.</p>
<p>The last thing we needed to consider was the whole pirate thing. The pirates attacked us because one of Serid’s subordinates contacted and hired them. It was really weird that the prince and princess didn’t have any sort of combat-based escort ship that went along with them on the trip either. That, like everything else thus far, was something that was within Serid's realm of manipulation given the extent of his power.</p>
<p>Yeah uh… it seemed that all the evidence pointed to Serid.</p>
<p>「Captain.」</p>
<p>「Y-Yes?」</p>
<p>「No escort ships. Why?」</p>
<p>「That was apparently just the type of job it was. We were told that bringing escorts along would make us stand out.」</p>
<p>Okay yeah, this whole thing seems super suspicious. People might start doubting us soon too, and yeah, I’d really prefer for that not to happen, so we should probably get this solved and over with soon.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Who hired you?」</p>
<p>「I can’t say for sure until check out the logs we have back at HQ, but… It should’ve been Serid.」</p>
<p>「T-That is nothing short of impossible. I see no reason for that responsibility to have fallen on my head.」</p>
<p>「What are you saying Serid? We agreed that you would be responsible for arranging our boat trip.」</p>
<p>「Yes, I am aware of that. However, I instructed one of my men to handle the task for me.」</p>
<p>「Did you not find it odd that he was only able to procure a single vessel?」</p>
<p>「Of course I did. However, I also felt it reasonable given the season and circumstances. I was informed that we would instead be prepared a state of the art vessel equipped with the newest technology, so I had reluctantly agreed to the terms proposed.」</p>
<p>He wasn’t lying, which meant he actually didn’t have anything to do with prepping the ship either?</p>
<p>「Who got ship ready?」</p>
<p>「I-It should have been Naymario!」</p>
<p>Serid looked towards one of the men standing by the prince’s side. Serid seemed to have thought that he had asked him to hire the Luciel Conglomerate, but the man, Naymario, only shook his head in response.</p>
<p>「I merely followed your orders.」</p>
<p>「What!? Naymario, you traitor!」</p>
<p>Serid’s pitch rose in surprise, which made sense. Naymario was lying, after all.</p>
<p>In other words, Naymario was trying to frame Serid.</p>
<p>Salrut acted before Serid could give any further replies. He promptly gave his head an understanding nod and got his men to force Serid on his feet.</p>
<p>「Restrain that man immediately. He has committed treason through the act of plotting the assassination of a member of the royal family.」</p>
<p>Wait, hold up. I still want to keep the interrogation going for a bit longer. Serid isn’t actually guilty, so yeah.</p>
<p>「Wait.」</p>
<p>「What is it, Fran?」</p>
<p>「Want to ask a bit more.」</p>
<p>「That should not be necessary. You have already done enough, you’ve exposed the criminal’s conspiracy. Please, leave the rest to me.」</p>
<p>「No proof yet. Might not be mastermind.」</p>
<p>「I am absolutely certain that he is, especially given all the evidence presented.」</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p>（Master?）</p>
<p>『Salrut just lied.』</p>
<p>（Nn?）</p>
<p>『Let’s try throwing a few questions at Naymario and Salrut in turn.』</p>
<p>（Nn. Got it.）</p>
<p>This whole scenario had taken quite the interesting turn.</p>
<p>「Naymario. Question.」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「Really followed Serid’s instructions?」</p>
<p>「To the letter.」</p>
<p>Yup, he definitely just lied. I’m absolutely positive that he’s in on this whole thing, but I can’t yet tell if he’s the one pulling the strings or if he's just a pawn.</p>
<p>「Salrut too.」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「Not a Raidosian spy?」</p>
<p>「Hah hah hah! Of course not! I’ve long cast that country aside and devoted every last fibre of my being to the Fyrias Kingdom.」</p>
<p>Salrut declared his allegiances in a confident, convincing voice. It’d sounded like he didn’t even need to think before answering.</p>
<p>His act was awfully convincing, but in the end, it was just an act. It didn’t matter how persuasive he sounded. There was simply no way for him to bypass the Principle of Falsehood.</p>
<p>『I hate to say it, but it looked like Serid was right. Salrut’s a Raidosian spy.』</p>
<p>（Really?）</p>
<p>『Really.』</p>
<p>Thinking about it from that perspective made everything click into place.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Reidos had a pretty good relationship with the illegal slave merchants from which it bought its goods. He probably didn’t need to do anything beyond just saying the word to get them on board with his plans.</p>
<p>He was also more than just capable of producing the opportunity the assassin needed to sneak into the building. Plus, he didn’t even tell Serid that there was an assassin in the first place. He just covered it up instead. The dark knight had said he was going to hand the assassin over to the proper authorities, but thinking about it, he probably just silenced him instead.</p>
<p>It would’ve been pretty easy for him to hire the pirates too so long as he and Naymario were working together. Or rather, it was pretty obvious that they were working together.</p>
<p>I mean, Serid’s attitude hadn’t helped in the slightest, but man, Salrut had totally pulled one over our heads.</p>
<p>（What now?）</p>
<p>『Good question. I wish I knew the answer…』</p>
					
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>95. The Sword of Truth (Not Really)</b></p>
<p>Man, Salrut really got us. I never thought that he of all people would actually be the person pulling the strings behind all this.</p>
<p>I really wish I found out his true nature right when we met, but, keeping the Principle of Falsehood active 24/7 wasn’t exactly something I was willing to do.</p>
<p><span id="more-217"></span></p>
<p>The thing is, I was actually planning to sit down and interrogate him, but I ended up inadvertently trusting him because he was one of the twins’ acquaintances.</p>
<p>In fact, we ended up trusting him so much that we hadn’t even considered using the skill on him until after we’d used it on Naymario.</p>
<p>『Hmm… What to do…?』</p>
<p>Either way, we first decided to heal the soldiers that we just beat up so that they wouldn’t die while we considered our options. Only after that did I continue to ponder.</p>
<p>I was absolutely certain that Salrut was a Reidosian spy and that he was working together with Naymario. The only problem was that I couldn’t prove it. We couldn’t prove that we had the ability to see through lies either, so that was a no go.</p>
<p>Man, all this spy and conspiracy stuff was a huge pain to deal with. I almost just wanted to ditch them and pretend I didn’t see anything, but… nah, that’d be going a bit too far. At this rate, Salrut was probably going to end up having the twins assassinated whilst also silencing Serid in the process.</p>
<p>I mean, I couldn't have cared less about what ends up happening to Serid, but, I did want to help the twins. They were Fran’s friends. She’d probably end up pretty sad if something happened to them.</p>
<p>『We need to figure out how we can get him to confess.』</p>
<p>（Beat him up?）</p>
<p>（Woof?）</p>
<p>『Wait, wait. Beating information out of someone isn’t supposed to be the first thing you turn to. It’s more of a last resort.』</p>
<p>（Really?）</p>
<p>The way I saw it, spies tended to be the type of people that wouldn’t talk regardless of how much you tortured them, so roughing him up might not even help us at all to begin with.</p>
<p>And if things went south, then we might end up being wanted by the state.</p>
<p>「Is that enough? I would really like to get to questioning him.」</p>
<p>Crap! They’re going to go drag Serid off somewhere if I don’t think of something quick. Come on me! Think! Think!</p>
<p>（Brute force?）</p>
<p>（Woof woof!）</p>
<p>『Hold on! I already told you to make that our last resort!』</p>
<p>If this kept up, Fran was probably going to pull her supposed last resort out right away.</p>
<p>Wait, I got it! This’ll probably sound a bit forced, but it was pretty much the only thing I could think of given a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>『Fran, make sure you repeat exactly what I say.』</p>
<p>（Nn. Got it.）</p>
<p>『Urushi, go casually stand around where Salrut and Naymario are so they can’t run away or anything like that.』</p>
<p>（Woof!）</p>
<p>Alright, here's to hoping this works…</p>
<p>「Wait. Just a bit.」</p>
<p>First things first, we made sure they didn’t actually carry Serid off anywhere.</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>Salrut seemed a bit irritated at the fact that Fran stopped him again, which was good. The less calm he was, the easier this would be.</p>
<p>「Have item. Will help prove Serid’s guilt.」</p>
<p>「Oh?」</p>
<p>Salrut made a bit of a dubious face in response. He likely didn’t want us to interfere further, but decided to go along with it for the time being. Serid, on the other hand, had his face cloud over. He probably thought we were on Salrut’s side, and that we were trying to make him seem even more guilty than he already was.</p>
<p>「Seal release.」</p>
<p>I immediately began to transform, seemingly in response to Fran’s words. I activated Thunder Blade while also using purification based magic in order to make myself appear divine.</p>
<p>「Woah!」</p>
<p>「W-What in the world is that?」</p>
<p>The people around us let out cries of shock as they watched a glowing sword suddenly change shape right before their very eyes. My blade grew several wing shaped protrusions; I turned what appeared to be a ceremonial weapon, an armament used for nothing more than rituals.</p>
<p>「W-What is that?」</p>
<p>「Sword of Truth. Functionality easier to show than explain. Flut.」</p>
<p>「Y-Yes?」</p>
<p>「Say sister’s name.」</p>
<p>「Wha?」</p>
<p>「Tell me your sister's name. Give answer.」</p>
<p>「A-Alright. My sister’s name is Satia Diel Fyrias.」</p>
<p>『The truth has been spoken.』</p>
<p>「W-Woah, where did that voice come from!?」</p>
<p>「Sword of Truth. Magic tool. Discerns the truth from lies.」</p>
<p>Yup, one big fat lie, coming right up. Well, actually it is <i>kind of</i> true, seeing as how I do have the Principle of Falsehood. Whatever, either way, this was what I managed to come up with at the last possible moment. We were going to convince everyone that I was some sort of magical lie detector so we could demonstrate that Salrut wasn't what he appeared to be. In other words, we were trying to get him to confess.</p>
<p>First things first though, we had to make sure that everyone here actually thought I was able to discern between what was true and what wasn’t.</p>
<p>Times like this almost made me wish I had a skill improved our ability to act or something, but whatever. The issue was that I was kind of a sword, and I wasn’t really moving around or anything, so I wasn’t sure if I could actually manage to convince everyone that I was in fact the real deal. Moreover, the Principle of Falsehood didn’t actually make Fran herself sound any more convincing. It did, however, make me sound more convincing, which was good enough, I guess.</p>
<p>I made sure to make my voice as monotone and machine-like as I could. In fact, I actually based my speech patterns off the system announcer. I even went as far as to use Appraisal Jamming in order to make myself a fake status page, but unfortunately, no one here could actually use appraisal, so that ended up as nothing but wasted effort.</p>

</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>「Next, Satia’s turn. Ask a question.」</p>
<p>「Okay. In that case, I’ll ask my brother something. Flut, what present did we get from our elder sister, Angellica, on our fifth birthday?」</p>
<p>「I believe she gave us a pair of matching amulets.」</p>
<p>『The truth has been spoken.』</p>
<p>「It answered!」</p>
<p>「And it was correct too.」</p>
<p>「I-I’ll ask the next question. What is our father’s favourite food?」</p>
<p>「I believe it is meat.」</p>
<p>『A lie has been told.』</p>
<p>「I-It was right again!」</p>
<p>It looked like the twins’ father, the king, was probably more fond of sweet foods. That means he’s probably really fat. I wonder if he’s got diabetes.</p>
<p>The twins took turns asking each other questions. The started out asking fairly innocent stuff like their mother’s name and questions regarding the menu they were presented for dinner the day before yesterday. Soon, however, it devolved to the point where they began asking each other when they last wet the bed and who their first crushes were. I almost wanted to tell them to stop. I really didn't need to know their deepest, darkest secrets.</p>
<p>In the end, we managed convince both twins that I was a genuine lie detector.</p>
<p>「I-It really can discern the truth from lies.」</p>
<p>「What an amazing magical item it is.」</p>
<p>「Next, Captain.」</p>
<p>「Me?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The next group we tried to convince was the ship’s crew. Unlike the prince and princess, they asked nothing indecent. They focused on questions to which I shouldn’t know the answer. That is, they asked each other for information regarding their wives, pets, and recent meals.</p>
<p>And so, we managed to convince all the people around us that I really was the Sword of Truth. In other words, the stage was set.</p>
<p>Salrut’s face had gradually began to warp ever so slightly out of shape. He was probably panicking on the inside. He knew that I would be be able to tell that Serid was innocent.</p>
<p>「Hah hah hah! That is quite the amazing item you’ve got there. However, we have no need for it. We all know for a fact that Serid was the one that’d hired the pirates. The pirates said it themselves, after all.」</p>
<p>He immediately tried to brush it off, but there was no way that I was about to let him get off the hook. And so, Fran completely ignored the dark knight and instead turned to Serid in order to ask him a question.</p>
<p>「Did you plan to kill the twins?」</p>
<p>「I have never plotted anything along those lines! I swear that I am innocent!」</p>
<p>『The truth has been spoken.』</p>
<p>「T-That’s impossible! Hearhghalskjdhg」</p>
<p>Salrut tried to speak, but I shut him up with telekinesis. Alright, let’s keep this going!</p>
<p>「Planned to have them kidnapped?」</p>
<p>「I did not.」</p>
<p>『The truth has been spoken.』</p>
<p>「Asked the pirates to attack?」</p>
<p>「I have never once involved myself with those ruffians!」</p>
<p>『The truth has been spoken.』</p>
<p>「Asked Naymario to book the ship?」</p>
<p>「I did.」</p>
<p>『The truth has been spoken.』</p>
<p>The people around us had looks of shock plastered all over their faces. They’d thought Serid to be some sort of despicable traitor, but it turned out that he had been innocent all along.</p>
<p>「Next, Naymario.」</p>
<p>「I-I don’t see the need to answer your questions.」</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, alright, whatever. He wasn’t getting away anyways, seeing as how Urushi was standing right behind him.</p>
<p>「Tried to frame Serid?」</p>
<p>「O-Of course not!」</p>
<p>『A lie has been told.』</p>
<p>Both twins’ eyes sharpened in response to his answer.</p>
<p>「Conspiring with Salrut?」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>He didn’t respond to the question. Oh well, whatever.</p>
<p>「Conspiring with Salrut? Silence is yes.」</p>
<p>「That’s…」</p>
<p>『The truth has been spoken.』</p>
<p>「Salrut wants to kill twins? Silence still yes.」</p>
<p>「I-I have no idea what you’re talking about! None whatsoever!」</p>
<p>『A lie has been told.』</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Everyone on the ship had started to point their glares in Naymario’s direction. They all believed him to be a traitor. The Sword of Truth could discern the truth, after all.</p>
<p>That aside, the Principle of Falsehood really was a terrifyingly potent skill. You could probably topple a country with ease if you abused it. But even with all that considered, I still felt that we should probably avoid using it as much as possible. I mean, we had that stupid Auguste noble lead by example and showed us exactly what would happen if we relied on it too much. So yeah, I think we’d be much better off avoiding it as much as possible.</p>
<p>「Next. Questions for Salrut.」</p>
<p>Alright, what now bro? I’m the Sword of Truth, come at me. I’m about to expose all your lies!</p>
<p>「Fuck! Damned brat!」</p>
<p>It seemed like Salrut had also believed that I really was the Sword of Truth. Well, I mean, he was pretty much guaranteed to given what he’s seen me do.</p>
<p>He clearly understood that he couldn’t afford to try to make any sort of excuse, and so, he immediately drew the sword on his hip and leapt towards the twins.</p>
<p>「It looks like I have no other choice but to do this myseagh!」</p>
<p>Or at least he tried to.</p>
<p>「Growl!」</p>
<p>Urushi had instantly turned back to his normal size and pinned the dark knight down with one of his front paws.</p>
<p>「No more need for questions.」</p>
<p>A single glance at the twins’ faces revealed that they now knew the truth, that Salrut had been deceiving them all along.</p>
<p>「This can’t be… Salrut, why!?」</p>
<p>Prince Flut’s immediate reaction was to let out a bitter shout, a shout that resounded throughout the ship in its entirety.</p>
					
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>96. One Difficulty After Another.<br>
</b></p>
<p>TLN: So I just realized that I had a bit of a translation inconsistency. I was going back and forth between Raidos and Reidos because they sounded the same in my head and my fingers would just do whatever. It’s all been standardized as Reidos now. I also retranslated Hardened Skin to Vulcanization because it sounds better and its more applicable to things without skin that way.</p>
<p><span id="more-228"></span></p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Salrut glared at Fran with eyes filled with hatred as Urushi held him down in front of her.</p>
<p>「The Godblade should belong to my country!」</p>
<p>So he really was after the Godblade. Well, it was a super weapon that was strong enough to throw off the balance of power held between nations. Reidos seemed kind of scummy, so it would only make sense for them to want it.</p>
<p>We weren’t able to extract any other information out of him. He let loose the fact that Reidos wanted the Godblade, but refused to say anything else thereafter. I guess it can’t be helped. Spies were tight lipped after all.</p>
<p>We probably could’ve gotten him to spill the beans if we tortured him, but there were children around, so yeah….</p>
<p>Besides, interrogating him was Serid’s job, not ours. If we went ahead and pried the information out of him, we might’ve ended up getting stuck in an international conflict. We were pretty much leg deep in it already, so I didn’t want us to get even more involved.</p>
<p>「Salrut… Why…?」</p>
<p>「I can’t believe he was deceiving us this whole time.」</p>
<p>The twins were still in shock. Apparently, he acted as their guard for over five whole years.</p>
<p>Salrut had claimed to have abandoned the Kingdom of Reidos about eight years ago. He then spent his days wandering around until he ended up somewhere in the Fyrias Kingdom. He happened to stumble upon the Queen as she was being attacked by insurgents, so he protected her, and thus, she decided to grant him a position of knighthood. He had worked as hard as he could for several years on end, and sp, he was eventually given the honor of guarding members of the royal family.</p>
<p>Okay, that’s pretty shady. So basically, he showed up at the same time as a bunch of insurgents and drove them off without taking even the slightest scratch despite being just one dude with a horse? Yeah, seems just a bit more than a bit fishy to me.</p>
<p>Wasn’t the queen like, a little too unwary of this sort of thing? I mean, I know he saved her life and all, but she literally placed a Reidosian knight in a position that allowed him direct contact with the royal family.</p>
<p>That thought led to a sneaking suspicion, so I decided to check Salrut’s equipment over just to figure out the effects of all the magic items he had on hand.</p>
<p>Name: Ring of Bonds</p>
<p>Effect: Makes it easier for the wearer to bond with other people. This item becomes more effective the longer one stays in contact with the wearer.</p>
<p>Honestly, I hadn’t paid it too much mind at first, but that was only because I didn’t think its effect to be too significant. It turned out that I was wrong. The ring’s effect was much more than I’d been expecting. I used the Eye of Empyria alongside Magical Perception and Sorcery in order to further investigate the item only to find that it’d been imbued with a very significant amount of magical power.</p>
<p>It wasn’t strong enough to brainwash people or anything like that, but was more than enough to make one throw almost all their wariness out the window.</p>
<p>「This ring?」</p>
<p>「What are you doing!? Stop tha-geh!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>It looked like something really important, as Salrut started to struggle the moment we tried to take it from him, but Urushi immediately applied more force to his front paw and crushed all the dark knight's resistance.</p>
<p>Apparently, he was having a lot of fun grinding Salrut into the ground with his paws. He’d even occasionally switch between his two front paws just so he could squish him a bit with each in turn. Every time he did, Salrut would let out a funny sounding groan, which only entertained the large, black wolf all the more.</p>
<p>「What is it, Fran?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Ring. Suspicious.」</p>
<p>Fran handed Salrut’s ring over to Serid after forcibly ripping it off his finger. Taking the ring away from him had seemed to be the right choice given the impatient tone the act had elicited in response.</p>
<p>Immediately following that, we decided to go around questioning all the knights. Normally, spotting one cockroach meant that there were actually around ten others roaming about, and spies were pretty much cockroaches in their own right. Through that act, we managed to weed out two more traitors.</p>
<p>And that was pretty much it. We did all we could for them so I returned to my usual form and returned to the sheath hanging off Fran’s back.</p>
<p>The next thing we decided to do was to head to Barbra, or least it was until we realized that the pirates still had treasure hidden away at their base. More importantly was the fact that that said base was on route. Apparently, it was hidden away amongst a bunch of islands.</p>
<p>It sounded like they had a bunch, so I was really looking forward to raiding the place. We ended up doing a tonne, so we totally needed a plentiful reward, right?</p>
<p>Captain Rengil asked the pirate captain an interesting question as we had the latter guide us over to his hideout.</p>
<p>「Attacking a ship and murdering the royalty on it really isn’t a pirate-like thing to do, is it?」</p>
<p>Wait, really? It sounded perfectly pirate-like to me.</p>
<p>「It’s not?」</p>
<p>Apparently Fran was wondering the same thing, so she immediately asked the captain for his reasoning.</p>
<p>「Well, pirates may be ruffians through and through, but, they don’t normally kill people who don’t fight back. They almost never harm anyone that chooses to surrender.」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>「Really. Attacking ships the way they do is something that naturally incurs a lot of risk. Most ships tend to be guarded by mercenaries or adventurers, and they don’t even know what’s on the ship until after they after they take it over.」</p>
<p>Oh, I get it. So there’s a pretty good chance they’ll lose more than they gain.</p>
<p>「That’s why they normally choose to take hostages and demand ransom payments in exchange for their safety. It’s far more profitable for them that way. It’s kind of weird to put it like this, but the piracy business is built on trust. People wouldn’t pay ransom if they didn’t trust the pirates not to harm their hostages, after all.」</p>
<p>「Makes sense.」</p>
<p>「Murdering members of the royal family is pretty much completely out of the pirates’ realm of operation. If their deeds were discovered, then whatever country the royals belonged to would likely send a subjugation force. Moreover, the public would lose trust in them and effectively force them to terminate their business.」</p>
<p>「Then, Serid’s suggestion, surrendering. Correct decision?」</p>
<p>「Under normal circumstances, yes. Surrendering would have been the best possible decision by far.」</p>
<p>Ohhhh, that’s how it is. Whoops. Sorry Serid, I really shouldn’t have started suspecting you because of that. I blame Salrut, it’s all his fault.</p>
<p>「We decided to accept the request because we really needed the money. Thought it’d work out because there wouldn’t be any proof.」</p>
<p>Apparently, Salrut had actually started probing them out about a week ago. That was probably right around when he started getting ready to have the prince and princess murdered.</p>
<p>The pirates had figured out that everything would go well so long as they followed Salrut’s instructions. They likely would have succeeded had we not been here. To Salrut, hiring Fran was akin to digging his own grave.</p>
<p>Well, technically, I guess he wasn't the one that dug it out. The twins were responsible for the suggestion. The three of them got along pretty well, so they must’ve wanted to spend more time with her.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>Either way, as far as Salrut was concerned, hiring Fran was akin to throwing another factor into the mix. He probably allowed it because the lack of an escort ship meant that they didn’t really have that many people to fend off any incoming magic beasts, and he himself wasn’t exactly planning to die at sea. The issue lay with the fact that he had no idea that she was strong enough to sink the entire pirate fleet with ease.</p>
<p>「Needed money? Why?」</p>
<p>「You remember the condition our ships were in?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>It looked like they’d just been through some sort of battle. Some of them even had holes in their decks.</p>
<p>「We needed money so we could have them repaired.」</p>
<p>「Why so damaged?」</p>
<p>「It all happened seven days ago…」</p>
<p>The pirate seemed to go straight down memory lane.</p>
<p>「We did the usual. We left our hideout in search of prey.」</p>
<p>His eyes seemed kind of hazy, as if he was looking at something far off in the distance. Come on, I really don’t care about all the this sentimental stuff. Just sum it up for us or something.</p>
<p>Apparently, they left their base as usual, one thing led to another, and they eventually ended up running into a gigantic magic beast. The magic beast instantly sank four of their ships, left two heavily damaged, and the rest in the state in which we first saw them.</p>
<p>「Magic Beast?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, it was a gigantic monster the likes of which I’d never seen before. If I had to guess, I’d say it was most likely some type of sea serpent.」</p>
<p>「How big?」</p>
<p>「I couldn’t see the whole thing, but, its girth was about the same as my ship’s.」</p>
<p>Woah, that’s big. If it was as wide as a ship, then it was most likely about a hundred odd meters long.</p>
<p>It was probably the magic beast that we’d heard about back in Dharz, the one that was seen hanging around the coastal area.</p>
<p>I don’t know if we’ll end up running into it, but I guess we should be extra careful just in case seeing as how we didn’t know the extent of its strength.</p>
<p>Wait, I feel like I might’ve just jinxed it. Nah… no way, right…?</p>
<p>「We’ve spotted a massive shadow in the ocean. It’s right in front of us.」</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, I definitely just jinxed it.</p>
<p>「Master.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, I know. Let’s go, Urushi!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>The magic beast we were about to challenge was one strong enough to completely demolish the pirate’s fleet with ease. This little ship of ours would probably be screwed if we just sat around and didn’t do anything.</p>
<p>「Captain.」</p>
<p>「It’s right over there, Fran!」</p>
<p>We looked in the direction the captain was pointing, and surely enough, we saw something massive wriggling around beneath the water’s surface despite the fact that we were still over a hundred meters away from it.</p>
<p>「It looks like it’s heading right for us.」</p>
<p>「Can’t get away?」</p>
<p>「I doubt it. It’s a bit too quick for us.」</p>
<p>Well, I guess that means we’re going to have to fight. Wait, Fran, why are your eyes sparkling like that? We’re in a pretty bad spot here, you know?</p>
<p>「Victory goes to first to attack.」</p>
<p>『Hah…. Alright, I guess it can’t be helped. Let’s hit it with everything we’ve got.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The only thing I was worried about was the fact that our attacks might not land given that the giant sea serpent was still underwater.</p>
<p>『Hey Urushi, could you try provoking it a bit so it surfaces?』</p>
<p>「Bark bark bark!」</p>
<p>Wow, they both seem like they really want to go at it. I mean, that’s good and all, but they’re almost kind of like warmongers at this point.</p>
<p>Alright, I guess Fran and I will get ready to attack while Urushi does his thing. The enemy’s body was so big that we had no choice but to go all out.</p>
<p>『I’m going to use my Telekinetic Catapult. Could you throw me while using wind magic and some sort of Elemental Blade to power it up?』</p>
<p>「Roger.」</p>
<p>The first thing I did was transform and optimize my body in order to draw out as much power as possible. The image I had in mind was something like a bullet. I purged all my spare parts and carved a spiral like groove into my body.</p>
<p>My resulting form was one that I felt like I’d seen before. Ah, right, I very closely resembled a certain Archer’s rendition of Caladbolg, which was fine seeing as how I’d gained a lot more penetrating power.</p>
<p>I then proceeded to activate Flame Blade, wind magic, Vibration Fang, and Vulcanization simultaneously. Parallel Processing allowed it all to happen without a hitch.</p>
<p>『You ready, Fran?』</p>
<p>（Nn. Ready whenever.）</p>
<p>『Alright, good.』</p>
<p>I began getting ready to use Telekinesis.</p>
<p>And then, our chance came.</p>
<p>「Gyagyagagagagaoooo!」[1]</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Urushi. Good job.」</p>
<p>Urushi had been firing potshots at the creature from above. It didn’t take him long to annoy it enough for it to finally surface. It’s giant head emerged from the sea as it attempted to chase him down. It was so big that it looked like it could probably swallow an entire blue whale with ease.</p>
<p>It didn’t look like a snake though. Instead, it moreso resembled an earthworm. Its mouth looked like that of a sea anemone in that it was lined with gigantic fangs.</p>
<p>「Go!」</p>
<p>『Yeah, let’s do this!』</p>
<p>Fran threw me with everything she had. Her throw alone was so powerful that it had enough kinetic energy to send me flying through anything on or below the level of a lesser wyvern.</p>
<p>I released all of the telekinetic force I’d been saving up and accelerated myself even further.</p>
<p>『Uoooooohhhhh！』</p>
<p>A massive impact force assaulted the magic beast the moment I made contact; a crater ten meters in diameter suddenly appeared where I assumed the creature’s neck was.</p>
<p>The impact was so powerful that it sent me flying off in some direction immediately afterwards. A good chunk of my blade had been destroyed, and the rest had cracks running through it. It looked like using Overboost really did put way too much strain on my body.</p>
<p>But I didn’t have any time to lament over the amount of damage my suicide attack had done to me.</p>
<p>『Holy crap! What the hell is this thing!?』</p>
<p>Appraising the magic beast had left me in a state of shock and awe.<br>

<p><b>Description</b>: An ocean parasite said to have the ability to grow infinitely. It’s not very smart and does nothing but follow its instincts. It’ll even attempt to eat anything that moves. It lacks any sort of unique abilities, the only thing special about it is its size. However, it is precisely its size that causes its enemies the most trouble. Legends have said that these creatures have even swallowed entire islands in the past. It is extremely difficult to kill, and is considered an A level threat. Its magic stone is located in its heart.</p>
<p>Seriously? It’s got over 30k HP!? The attack we just used didn’t even chunk 10% of its total health. To make matters worse, it was an A level threat.</p>
<p>It didn’t have that many skills, and if you only looked at its skills, you’d probably think that it was really weak. Its only selling point was that it was big. Seriously though, it was way too big for anyone’s good…</p>
<p>『Tsk. What a pain.』<br>

		<p><b>97. Is that a Worm or a Snake?<br>
</b></p>
<p>「Gyooo!」</p>
<p>The Midgard Wyrm turned its eyes on me with a threatening gaze. Or, at least that's how it felt. I couldn't actually see its eyes anywhere. That said, it seemed to have realized that the attack I’d just hit it with had damaged me as well.</p>
<p><span id="more-235"></span></p>
<p>I intended on piercing it all the way through, but its skin was too thick, and flesh too brawny. Its tough body stopped my Telekinetic Catapult in its tracks.</p>
<p>『This thing’s huge.』</p>
<p>Even just the part that’d risen above the water was 30 whole meters long.</p>
<p>I continued observing the magic beast as my blade regenerated. It was starting to heal up as well. Its regeneration was really low level, but its HP pool was massive to begin with, so it was actually healing fairly rapidly.</p>
<p>「Gyagaruooohhh!」</p>
<p>『Woah!』</p>
<p>The Midgard Wyrm spat something at me. Its aim was rather precise, the glob of stomach acid would’ve hit me head on if I hadn’t dodged. It looked like that attack was what it’d used to mess up all the pirate ships we saw.</p>
<p>『This thing's still just full of energy.』</p>
<p>I mean, it managed to stop my Telekinetic Catapult's momentum, but it still did have a giant gaping hole in its neck or head area. Normally, you’d think its movements would dull as a result, but it didn’t seem to have actually felt the attack at all.</p>
<p>It looked like we wouldn’t be able to kill it if we just tried to whittle down its HP. But that was fine, there were other ways for us to kill it.</p>
<p>We could try going for its vitals. Ideally, I’d like kill it by destroying its magic stone, but its body was so big that I was having trouble finding it. Oh well, whatever. We didn't actually need to bother finding its magic stone in order to kill it, seeing as how it had one of its vitals exposed.</p>
<p>I let loose a second overboosted Telekinetic Catapult.</p>
<p>My durability plummeted yet again in response to the resulting shockwave. The attack was a bit weaker than it was before because I didn’t have Fran’s assistance, but, it was still powerful enough to create a second, 8 meter wide crater right where the wyrm's head was.</p>
<p>『Hell yeah, how’s that?』</p>
<p>「Gyuuuuuuuuu!!!」</p>
<p>『Tsk. This thing’s still moving around as if nothing’s happened.』</p>
<p>Alright, whatever, I’ll just do it again then. I still had eighty percent of my mana left, so all in all, I could attack roughly five more times before having to devote the rest of my remaining mana into regeneration.</p>
<p>『Take this!』</p>
<p>「Gyaaaaa!!」</p>
<p>Okay, what the hell? The stupid wyrm was ridiculously sturdy. It was still moving around despite the fact that it was missing half its head.</p>
<p>I appraised again in order to check its stats, and it turned out that it still had more than 30k HP remaining, which meant that its head probably wasn’t one of its vitals.</p>
<p>Hmmm… I think I’ll give it another two or three shots just to see what happens.</p>
<p>『Die!』</p>
<p>「Gyogyaaaaa!!」</p>
<p>And so, the process repeated itself a few times, and I ended completely obliterating its head in its entirety. The Midguard Wyrm no longer possessed either a mouth or a brain, but…</p>
<p>『Why is it still alive!?』</p>
<p>It’s movements had dulled by only the slightest bit, and it didn’t seem like it was just going to roll over and die anytime soon. In fact, it looked perfectly fine. The flesh around where its head had been had already started to regenerate.</p>
<p>God damn thing doesn’t even die when its head gets blown the hell off. It’s way too big, and it’s got an unrelenting life force to boot. God damn fantasy creatures!</p>
<p>『I-Is it just flat out immortal?』</p>
<p>I guess it really is a worm. Rockworms were kind of like this too, they wouldn’t die even if you cut them in half.</p>
<p>『I think I might’ve used a bit too much mana…』</p>
<p>Damn it. I guess I’ll head back on over to Fran. Everything’ll only go downhill if I try to keep this up.</p>
<p>I flew back over to the ship while making it look like I was being drawn to Fran’s hand.</p>
<p>（Master, status update?）</p>
<p>『I won’t be able to kill it with my Telekinetic Catapult.』</p>
<p>（Got it.）</p>
<p>『But I do have an idea.』</p>
<p>（What?）</p>
<p>『…』</p>
<p>（Master?）</p>
<p>『Let's use Deathgaze.』</p>
<p>（Got it.）</p>
<p>The worm was just far too big, and it’s life force too unrelenting. Deathgaze’s ability to instantly kill its target had a pretty low success rate, but it should still activate once every 30 odd slashes.</p>
<p>Bringing up the suggestion made me feel vexed though. I was relying on other swords despite being a sword myself.</p>
<p>I guess this must be how it feels for a heart surgeon to entrust a parent to his colleague, or for a chef to ask another to cook for his daughter’s wedding. The bitterness of defeat welled up deep within every last fibre of my being.</p>
<p>But it couldn’t be helped. This wasn’t the time for me to be moping around…</p>
<p>（Understood, Master.）</p>
<p>Fran drew Deathgaze out from the dimensional storage. The very act of her brandishing the weapon caused the ship’s crew to gulp.</p>
<p>「W-What’s that?」</p>
<p>「It’s giving me a case of the chills…」</p>
<p>Deathgaze's blade was a deep, pitch black, with red, vein-like lines running up its length. Its appearance was about as ominous as it could get.</p>
<p>「Magic Sword. Deathgaze. Can instantly kill.」</p>
<p>「Ah, so you’re planning to use it to kill that thing?」</p>
<p>Yeap, the sailor had pretty much hit the nail on the head, but for some odd reason, the captain’s face was still twisted in unease.</p>
<p>「I’m not all too sure that the instant kill ability that sword has will actually work on the Midgard Worm.」</p>
<p>「Why?」</p>
<p>「I’ve heard rumors saying that Midgard Worms have more than one heart. Instant death effects may not function to their fullest.」</p>
<p>Seriously? It’s got multiple hearts? Well, I guess we can’t really be sure as to how effective Deathgaze’s abilities would be in that case. But whatever, it doesn’t matter. I don’t care how many hearts that damn thing has, I’ll just slash at it till it dies.</p>
<p>（Ready?）</p>
<p>『Yeah, let’s go.』</p>
<p>And so, I headed towards the Wyrm yet again. The sailors had their eyes on us though, so I had to make it look like Fran was controlling me.</p>
<p>「Sword Puppet Theatre.」</p>
<p>「Wow!」</p>
<p>Fran raised both her arms and acted like she was concentrating. To make the act look more natural, she would occasionally even mumble from time to time. It looked like she was having a lot of fun.</p>
<p>In reality, I was obviously just doing the usual and flying around using telekinesis. Likewise, I was also manipulating Deathgaze through the exact same set of actions.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>To the onlookers though, it seemed as if Fran was using some sort of mysterious skill to manipulate both swords as she pleased. She was left in a rather defenseless state, but Urushi was with her, so whatever.</p>
<p>（Good luck, Master.）</p>
<p>（Woof!）</p>
<p>『Just leave it to me!』</p>
<p>That said, all I was doing was flying around the Midgard Wyrm and dodging its attacks while slashing at it with Deathgaze in hopes of procing the latter's effect.</p>
<p>『Take this!』</p>
<p>「Gyaoaaaaahhh!」</p>
<p>Tsk. Deathgaze’s blade wasn’t actually capable of cutting through the wyrm’s overly thick skin. I had to give it a decent amount of momentum before it’d actually pierce the surface. Obviously, I didn't go as far as using Telekinetic Catapult, and a result, the damage inflicted per hit was rather miniscule.</p>
<p>Deathgaze finally activated its effect after 20 or so magic imbued slashes. Its blade shimmered with a deep scarlet light as it attempted to instantly kill the wyrm.</p>
<p>「Gyaaaaaaaa!!」</p>
<p>Hell yeah! It stopped moving!</p>
<p>A wave of euphoria washed over me, but it only lasted for an instant.</p>
<p>「Gugagaoooooh!」</p>
<p>『What!? Just die already!』</p>
<p>「Gyaaoooo!」</p>
<p>It looked like the captain’s suspicions had been on point. Deathgaze’s ability wasn’t able to instantly kill magic beasts with multiple hearts.</p>
<p>『Alright, fine! I’ll just destroy all your hearts then!』</p>
<p>「Gyooooo」</p>
<p>『Hey! Where are you going? I’m over here goddammit!』</p>
<p>「Gyaooooohhhhh!」</p>
<p>The Midgard Wyrm started to ignore me. Instead, it began making a beeline for the ship.</p>
<p>『Get back here fatass! This is supposed to be between you and me!』</p>
<p>I threw Deathgaze at the Wyrm, but I couldn’t get it to turn back around. It was much more interested in nice, edible, living things than a dangerous, inorganic organism like me.</p>
<p>I continued to attack it with Deathgaze and managed to get its effect to activate a second time. The wyrm once again stopped for a few seconds, after which it booted its body back. It soon continued its prior actions as if nothing had happened at all.</p>
<p>Moreover, it had accelerated. The ship Fran was on had already changed its course in an attempt to get away from the creature, but, it was going to catch up, and soon, at that. Damn it, it looks like I really might not be able to kill it with Deathgaze.</p>
<p>『Shit! What do I do? The poison isn’t working either…』</p>
<p>Attacking with Deathgaze wasn’t the only thing I’d done. I had also tried throwing in a few poison based attacks of my own, but they didn’t have any sort of effect on the wyrm at all. It didn’t have poison resistance or anything like that. Its body was simply just way too big, I would need to give it a much larger dose for it to actually have any effect. Damn it. It looked like size really did matter.</p>
<p>It didn’t look I had any way of actually killing the wyrm. It would just regenerate regardless of how much damage I did to it, so I decided to think up a method to slow it down instead. I guess I could try making it heavier, but… how?</p>
<p>『I got it!』</p>
<p>A light bulb had suddenly seemed to flash inside of my head. The idea I came up with would lead to a bit of a gamble, but I didn’t really have much time to think it through.</p>
<p>『Deploying max strength magical barriers! Activating Telekinesis!』</p>
<p>I circled around to the Midgard Wyrm’s front, and shot myself forward with another Telekinetic Catapult. This time, however, I didn’t aim for its body. Instead, I dove straight inside its half regenerated mouth.</p>
<p>『Commencing Operation Inch High Samurai!』 [1]</p>
<p>If I couldn’t hurt its exterior, I’d just hurt its interior instead.</p>
<p>『Holy crap, that’s disgusting.』</p>
<p>The Midgard Worm’s insides were nothing short of grotesque. Its organs were all clearly visible, and seeing them almost made me want to retch. To make matters worse, my durability was plummeting at an incredibly rapid pace. the wyrm didn’t actually have a stomach. Instead, it just had its whole body secrete stomach acid nonstop. I probably would’ve completely melted away in an instant if not for my magical barriers.</p>
<p>The original plan was for me to just kind of go crazy inside of him and destroy everything, but it didn’t look like that would work. I had to hurry up, finish my objectives, and then leave, else I’d probably melt.</p>
<p>The only issue lay with the fact that I needed to go a bit deeper inside the wyrm's body. I activated Telekinesis, threw myself in full throttle, and dove deep into the wyrm’s interior. I reached my destination around when my durability had hit the halfway point.</p>
<p>『Activating Dimensional Storage!』</p>
<p>I immediately brought out every last monolith at once and dropped them all inside the wyrm’s body.</p>
<p>If I dropped them near its mouth, then it’d be able to just spit them back out, but dropping them this deep would probably prevent that from happening.</p>
<p>I had actually wanted to dump the poisoned swamp we picked up as well, but I ended up deciding against it. I mean, it wouldn’t cause any issue if the wyrm’s body ended up absorbing it all, but, it’d probably lead to some major pollution if it managed to vomit it all back out. Honestly, I didn’t think it’d be <i>that</i> bad given how big the ocean was, but, we were kind of close to the shore, so I figured the risk wasn’t really worth the reward.</p>
<p>『Oh crap! My durability is getting really low, I’ve got to get out of here. Short Jump!』</p>
<p>My durability had started to decrease even more quickly because of the friction resulting from me rubbing against all the monoliths now in my immediate vicinity. I immediately used space/time magic and teleported a rather short distance. Luckily, I was able to get myself outside the wyrm and into the ocean.</p>
<p>Whew. I only had a hundred durability left.</p>
<p>『I really wish that the stupid thing would've exploded or at least ruptured though.』</p>
<p>The wyrm’s stomach had grown in width by a factor of 10, but it didn’t seem to show any sign of splitting open. Well, I guess it was a snake, and snakes were capable of swallowing things much bigger than themselves without much issue.</p>
<p>That said, having that many massive rocks in its body would probably slow it down.</p>
<p>And sure enough, a bit of observation led me to the conclusion that I was right.</p>
<p>Sweet, the ship should be able to get away before it manages to digest everything and speed itself back up.</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s get the hell outta here.』</p>

		<p><b>98. Side Story: Serid</b></p>
<p>I am Serid Dinias, chamberlain to the Kingdom of Fyrias.</p>
<p>The current task to which I have been assigned is to oversee Prince Flut and Princess Satia as they develop towards maturity. I have been with them since the earliest years of their childhood, but as of recent, I have started to feel the distance between us gradually begin to grow.</p>
<p><span id="more-239"></span></p>
<p>The emotional rift of which I had just discussed was caused but by a single man, Salrut O’Randy, former knight to the Kingdom of Reidos. Despite his former status, Salrut had earned himself a position within the Royal palace. He had obtained his otherwise unjustified position through the act of rescue Her Majesty from a group of insurgents.</p>
<p>He claimed to be a knight without a kingdom, one that had abandoned the Reidosian ways. His origin appeared dubious, and I therefore immediately assumed him to be a spy.</p>
<p>However, despite my suspicions, both His and Her Majesty both came to trust him. I could not fathom as to why, but neither of the two had placed even the slightest bit of doubt within the man. I understood that he saved Her Majesty from an otherwise dangerous situation, but she had conferred far too much faith in him for little reason.</p>
<p>I will admit that the Fryias Kingdom’s royal family did possess the tendency to be overly naive. The family's members were rather open and held an extreme lack of caution when compared to royals from other nations. But even then, I felt their choices to be strange and out of scope. They were far too trusting and unwary when it came to matters relating to the former Reidosian knight.</p>
<p>I had suspected that the man had manipulated Their Majesties minds with magic, and thus, I had my men conduct a series of investigations. Most notably, I requested men check as to whether Their Majesties had been charmed or brainwashed. I was almost certain that my suspicions had been correct, however, none of my examinations had ever returned positive results. Moreover, Their Majesties possessed barriers that would repel any weaker attempts, and I doubted that he was capable of casting the most complicated of spells.</p>
<p>I attempted to warn Their Majesties of my suspicions, but they claimed that they trusted him. My continued persistence led them to drive me from their sides in annoyance. Their choices and actions had left me feeling as mortified as a single individual possibly could.</p>
<p>However, I remained undissuaded from attempting to uncover Salrut’s actions regardless. In fact, I did precisely the opposite and furthered my efforts. I began publicly voicing my suspicions despite knowing that Their Majesties would only meet me with greater alienation. Thus was the extent of my resolve.</p>
<p>Salrut truly did well to deserve his title as a Reidosian spy. I was unable to find evidence that would allow me to incriminate him despite my many efforts. However, I did learn of his motifs.</p>
<p>His target was the Fyrias Kingdom’s Godblade. He wished to obtain Diabolos, The Demon Lord’s Blade.</p>
<p>Godblades were swords told spoken of in legend, but despite their existences being akin to common knowledge, their whereabouts were largely unknown. Many had even been completely forgotten as a result of the passage of time.</p>
<p>At the moment, there were only five Godblades with theirs names and wielders known to the world: Alpha, The Blade of Origin, Berserk, The Blade of Madness, Ignius, The Brilliant Flameblade, Gaia, The Earth’s Edge, and last but not least was our country's prided treasure, Diabolos, The Demon Lord’s Blade.</p>
<p>Diabolos was said to have an ancient Demon Lord sealed within it, and he who wielded the blade was to be granted said Demon Lord’s power. That is, the Godblade's ability was to summon subservient demons, and it was precisely that ability that has allowed our small, fragile nation to survive throughout the ages.</p>
<p>The blade’s weakness is said to be its relative inefficacy in single combat. The records show that a thousand years ago, the blade’s successor, one of our Kingdom's crown princes, had challenged the wielder of Crystalos, the Sacred Blade of Water to a duel. He and Diabolos had lost despite Crystalos not being a Godblade. That said, Diabolos more than made up for its deficiencies with its unique trait. Its ability to summon demons has allowed the Fyrias Kingdom to turn the tides of war time and time again.</p>
<p>Another one of Diabolos’ unique traits was that it could not be wielded but by a select few. Specifically, only those that had the Fyrias Kingdom’s royal blood flowing through their veins could even so much as touch the sword without losing their souls to it. If an unqualified individual attempted to wield the blade, they would lose their life on the spot.</p>
<p>Many other countries knew of the blade's abilities to force demons into one’s service, but the rest of its traits were carefully kept hidden except from those qualified to know the Kingdom’s national secrets. Members of the royal family would be told of the sword's properties upon their tenth birthdays. They, however, were not the only individuals informed. The king would also inform the Grand Chamberlain and six of his handpicked subordinates of the Godblade's details. The blade would also be described to the Prime Minister and the four men that headed the nation's army.</p>
<p>All individuals exposed to the country’s secrets were also granted demons. Naturally, I have one within myself as well. If my life is put in danger, then it will appear and protect me from harm. It is registered as a D level threat, so it is in fact quite powerful. However, I myself am a mere chamberlain. I lack royal blood, and therefore, I cannot control the demon's actions.</p>
<p>While having a demon by one’s side may sound convenient, I can assure that it is not necessarily so. The demon contains another feature in that it simultaneously acts as a sort of shackle. Those that attempt to inform the unknowing of the Godblade’s properties will immediately be robbed of their voices and transformed into mutes, all for the purpose of preserving secrecy. The demon's final unique trait functioned to much the same purpose. That is, the summoned demons possess the ability to hide themselves from those that are capable of appraisal. While appraisal is indeed a rare skill, it is not one that completely fails to manifest, and thus, this final ability can be said to be mission critical in the preservation of our country’s secrets.</p>
<p>Those that bear royal blood are naturally granted demons of a higher quality, C level threats. They serve to function as excellent guardians. They are even capable of healing injuries and eliminating any abnormal status. They so powerful that they can even reverse the deadliest of wounds in a matter of moments.</p>
<p>This, however, leads to its own fair share of complications. The demon’s power allows members of the royal family to escape most dangerous situations. Thus, they typically tend not to be very cautious; they fail to develop a true sense of danger.</p>
<p>And that is precisely what led to the incident that we had just experienced. Prince Flut and Princess Satia prepared for their trip to Kranzel with only the most minimal number of escorts. It appeared that Salrut had stated that he would protect the two of them on their journey, and thus, the King himself approved their plans.</p>
<p>Their Highnesses both had demons by their sides, and said demons would undoubtedly protect them from harm. However, it remained a fact that they were but children. It was always possible for them to fall into a sort of trap, and thus, I decided that it would be best for me to accompany them. I had hoped that I would be able to use the dangers that occurred throughout the trip to enlighten them so that they would better understand the risks that awaited them in the future.</p>
<p>And then, Salrut acted. One night, he brought back with him not only Their Highnesses, but also a group of children that I could only find to be suspicious. I admit that they were but mere children, and that they were unlikely to inflict harm on Their Highnesses’ persons. However, I was well aware that many assassins began work from a tender age, and thus, I practiced caution. I intentionally sharpened my tongue when addressing them; I tested each child's reactions in turn in order to gauge their purposes.</p>
<p>My probing had led me to believe that one of the children was far more suspicious than the rest. The individual that I had chosen to keep my eye on was a young, cat eared lass by the name of Fran. I was unable to see a respectable person in her regardless of how hard I looked. Moreover, I noticed her sneak around the building in order to converse with Salrut.</p>
<p>Both the Prince and Princess had seemed to take a liking to her. I, however, refused to be fooled. I decided then that I would expose the core of her character and thus, I attempted to get in her way. I secretly hoped for her judge me an obstacle, for she would be subject to a demon’s power should she have attempted to attack me.</p>
<p>All in all, I had presumed that I was still in control of the situation, but it soon spiraled far beyond even my wildest fantasies.</p>
<p>We were attacked by pirates as we traversed the seas. Fran defeated the enemy fleet and even went as far as to bring back their captain, and that was when the twist occurred. The aforementioned captain immediately began accusing me of plotting to assassinate the Prince and Princess.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>I had been caught in a trap. I was subject to a form of attack of which I had completely failed to anticipate.</p>
<p>I was knocked unconscious when I attempted to protest the situation. Much to my misfortune, my demon had not been summoned as there had been no danger to my life.</p>
<p>When I awoke, I found myself on the floor. One of my most trusted subordinates, Naymario, had betrayed me for the enemy. Their Highnesses proceeded to stare at me, their eyes filled with doubt and suspicion. I had been driven into a corner, and my heart had been filled but with despair.</p>
<p>But then, she assisted me. Fran had activated a peculiar item that went by the name "The Sword of Truth." Much to my surprise, she used the blade to prove my innocence. Witnessing the the item she possessed immediately led me to understand that it was one of extraordinary value. Its functionality was so incredible that I felt the urge to ask her whether she felt open to negotiation over its ownership.</p>
<p>In the end, I concluded that she too had merely been manipulated by Salrut. She was not on of his collaborators, nor was she another Reidosian spy. She was simply a child that happened to possess exceptional skill in the art of combat, and that was all.</p>
<p>Salrut truly was a fool. He attempted to assassinate Their Highnesses without even the slightest bit of knowledge of the demons that protected them. It appeared that he attempted to turn them into slaves as well, but even that would have been meaningless. The collars that induced slavery meant nothing before the demons that protected Their Highnesses.</p>
<p>Contemplating Salrut’s circumstances had led me to further develop my speculations. I arrived at the conclusion that he had likely discovered that only members of the royal family could touch the Godblade. Thus, he attempted to use one of our country's royals to fulfill his ambitions. However, that planned had ultimately ended in failure, and hence, he instead redirected his efforts into reducing the number of potential wielders. If we arrived in Barbra, then the prince and princess would’ve had eyes all over them. Moreover, Kranzel had its own information network, one that would make it difficult for him to many any sort of move. Hence, he had chosen to eliminate Their Highnesses before he lost the opportunity.</p>
<p>Such a plan would indeed have caused our country damage had it suceeded. The Godblade’s potential wielders were surprisingly low in number. The second prince was sickly, his body was unable to handle the burden that came with wielding Diabolos’ power. The third and fourth princes had both perished in the process of subjugating magic beasts. Most of our princesses had already been been wed, and thus, they no longer resided within the country. Moreover, it appeared that the Godblade itself had a sort of finicky nature. I cannot explain the reason for which this phenomenon occurs, but the Godblade refused to acknowledge those that had been married off as potential wielders. The same applied to their children despite the fact that Fyrias' royal blood ran through their veins.</p>
<p>In other words, the Godblade had very few potential wielders. There were only six different people could potentially put its power on display: His Majesty the King, the Crown Prince, the Fifth Princess, Prince Flut, Princess Satia, and the Seventh Princess. If Prince Flut and Princess Satia were to fall, then the Godblade would lose two of its six potential bearers. In other words, the Kingdom of Fyrias would suffer a heavy blow.</p>
<p>The mention of Prince Flut and Princess Satia reminded me of their current circumstances. Both were currently within the ship’s cabin. Their highnesses are still in shock as a result of Salrut’s sudden betrayal. I've no idea as to how I could improve their moods, so I’ve no choice but to await their recoveries.</p>
<p>I do hope that they will be able to calm themselves in time for our arrival, as they must attend the ceremonies held in Barbra in a manner befitting representatives of the Fyrias Kingdom. Our country is small one. The sea lies to our west, but each our other three borders leads to contact with another country. To our south is the hostile Kingdom of Reidos. To our north and east lies Kranzel, one of our greatest allies. Our relationship with the Kingdom of Kranzel is excellent, and therefore it is imperative for the Prince and Princess to appear to be in good spirits.</p>
<p>It was very fortunate that we were able to eliminate the Reidosian spy before arriving in Kranzel, for it would have been possible for him to attempt to damage the relationship between our countries. I cannot thank Miss Fran enough for her actions; she even managed to identify and seize one of his magic items, a ring that would make those around him less wary of his actions.</p>
<p>Our voyage across the ocean had truly been one filled with twists and turns. Salrut’s meddling had added danger and drama, but not even that was meant to be the end of it all. Fate reared its head once more as the pirate onslaught was immediately followed by the appearance of an enormous magic beast. The creature that threatened to end our lives was incredibly powerful. Its classification was that of an A level threat. It was far beyond anything our demons could protect us from, and so once again, I was assaulted by despair. My only hope at the time was that Their Highnesses would keep their lives.</p>
<p>However, it appeared that not all was lost. Miss Fran had somehow once again managed to save us. She immediately used a skill the likes of which I had never seen before and assaulted the approaching Midgard Wyrm with a series of fierce blows. Each had such strength that I could even tell from afar that she had managed to leave massive holes within the beast’s flesh.</p>
<p>Her power lay beyond the very realm of my comprehension. Witnessing it led me to think back on the attitude with which I had approached her. Needless to say, I immediately regretted my actions. My back had become drenched with ice cold sweat before I had even realized it.</p>
<p>I could not help but sigh in relief. I was grateful that she had tolerated my overly antagonizing actions.</p>
<p>She recalled her sword after her first stream of attacks and drew another. I witnessed her as she manipulated both weapons and barraged the magic beast with yet another glorious onslaught. It seemed that her second blade had the ability to instantly kill its foes, however, the wrym she was pitted against had multiple hearts, and therefore, multiple lives. Her second blade’s effect had failed her. The battle’s ultimate outcome appeared unpredictable; I had no idea as to how it would end, and so, I had no choice but to watch her every action as the scene unfolded before me.</p>
<p>The final attack she used involved plunging one of her swords through the beast’s mouth. It dove inside the wyrm’s stomach and performed a series of actions unknown to me. Whatever the sword did appeared effective, for the beast's movements seemed to dull as it let out a pained shriek.</p>
<p>The ship’s captain rejoiced, for the young lady’s actions had allowed us to escape the beast.</p>
<p>She then retrieved her blade with what appeared to be magic, sheathed it, and moved towards the pirate. The young miss instructed him to guide the ship to his base with a nonchalant expression. She looked as if she hadn’t even broken a sweat despite her many efforts. And so, once again, I was made to acknowledge her strength, and again, I was made to break out in cold sweat.</p>
<p>She then asked (threatened) for the individuals present not to reveal her abilities going forward. The same request applied to The Sword of Truth. No one present dared to defy her, we all nodded in obedience respect. Specifically, the line she uttered was as follows.</p>
<p>「Don’t tell. Likely will lead to regret.」</p>
<p>It was only natural for us to agree given what we had witnessed. Our inclination towards the provision of a positive response was only furthered by the wolf that stood behind us whilst growling in a low, threatening tone.</p>
<p>There was, however, one matter that I found important to note. Only her longsword had returned to her. I had no idea as to the other blade’s fate, but I presumed that she had lost it as a result of the battle. Her second blade had appeared to be of a considerable quality as it even had the ability to instantly slay its foes. I felt it to be a shame that she had lost it.</p>
<p>Further consideration led me to understand that the sword had only departed her because she had used it to protect us. It would not do for us not to compensate her for it. Salrut, the man technically responsible for her employment, was now being held in captivity, so it went without saying that the matter of her payment would also now fall upon our shoulders.</p>
<p>That, however, is but secondary. Her payment was a matter of great importance, but not one that took precedence over the acknowledgement and expression of my own wrongdoings. The manner in which I had treated was not but unfair and rude. I know not if she will forgive my actions, but I feel that I must offer her my most sincere and heartfelt apologies regardless.</p>
<p>「Excuse me, Miss Fran. Would you happen to have a spare moment?」</p>
					
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>99. Barbra<br>
</b></p>
<p>「We’ve got eyes on Barbra!」</p>
<p>We finally arrived at Barbra three days after our initial departure. Man, have we been through a lot. The trip was full of nothing but ups and downs, we hit unexpected twists and turns at almost every single corner.</p>
<p><span id="more-250"></span></p>
<p>Surprisingly, today was still only the 30th of March, which meant that we actually managed to make it in time for the Lunar Banquet.</p>
<p>The first thing we did after escaping the Midgard Wyrm’s wrath was raiding the pirates’ base. That is, we casually cruised over, kicked them around, and “happened upon” all their treasure. I’ve got to say, it was it well worth it. Their vault was filled with cash, equipment, exotic spices, jewels, and plenty of expensive looking items made from gold and silver.</p>
<p>I mean, technically speaking, the treasure we “found” didn’t have anyone’s name written on it, and you know, finders keepers and stuff. Yup, we totally didn’t steal it. Not at all. Besides, it’s not like we were the only ones that went through with the act of “stumbling across” treasure. Countries would embezzle stuff from pirates all the time. Moreover, their methodologies were far more shameless than our own. They’d even go as far as to create this whole pretense in which they’d talk about taking things back for the people even though they always ended up just chucking all the pirates' loot straight into their national reserves.</p>
<p>The ship’s Captain, Rengil, happened to be a merchant, so we had him look over all the stuff we “found.” Apparently, it totalled up to approximately a hundred million Golde. I had personally had thought it to be an absolutely monumental sum. In fact, I even had trouble wrapping my head around it all. That said, it was still not that much in proportion to what was needed to repair all the pirates’ ships. The magic tools and items used in a ship’s construction were extremely expensive. Each cannon and propulsion system would each flat out cost a fortune on its own.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, we wouldn’t actually be entitled to even the slightest piece of the loot, as adventurers were typically put in the same category as the ship’s crew when it came to this kind of thing. If they were lucky, they’d get a small bonus, but that was all. All the treasure we found was supposed to be rightfully belong to its discoverers and our employers. In this case, those two parties would be the Luciel Conglomerate and the Prince's group respectively.</p>
<p>However, the feats we had accomplished had been outstanding. We saved the ship twice, weeded out a spy, and even protected the two royals from all the possible harm that would’ve otherwise befallen them. Thus, they decided to give us a fair chunk of the treasure.</p>
<p>We were allowed the option to pick whatever we wanted, so we immediately claimed a large portion of the spices the pirates had saved up. Many of the aforementioned spices were extremely rare and expensive, there were even some that I’d never seen before. Eyeballing, I’d say we took enough to make about ten thousand servings of curry, which meant we profited at least a hundred thousand gold Golde off the spices alone.</p>
<p>They said we could have a cut of the actual jewelry type stuff as well, so we happily accepted their offer. I didn’t really know what was valuable and what weren’t, so we just decided just take a random pair of treasure chests. The first chest we chose was on the smaller side, but whatever. The second was kind of interesting in the sense that it the Alchemist’s Guild’s crest engraved upon it. We didn’t actually check what was inside either chest, but if anything, that was the part that fired me up the most. [1]</p>
<p>After splitting some of the loot with us, they went ahead and paid us another additional sum on top of all that. The prince's party was really generous, and all in all, we ended up with about two million Golde on hand. Holy crap, the amount of cash we had flat out doubled because of this one little job.</p>
<p>Having an abundance of cash meant that Fran could splurge on whatever the hell she wanted during our stay here in Barbra.</p>
<p>「Thank you very much for everything you’ve done, Fran.」</p>
<p>「We truly have been in your care.」</p>
<p>It took them two whole days, but the twins had managed to calm themselves down. Their expressions were still a bit clouded over, so they hadn’t fully recovered, but, they’d at least regained their smiles.</p>
<p>「I offer you but the most sincere gratitude. We likely would have perished during our travels if not for your advent.」</p>
<p>Serid did the same thing the twins had and lowered his head in a deep bow. He’d surprisingly warmed up to us after the whole Sword of Truth incident. Apparently, only only treated us the way he did because he’d thought that we were Salrut’s accomplices.</p>
<p>「We will be staying in Barbra for approximately a week. Our place of residence will be the Lord’s Manor. Do pay us a visit if you happen to pass by, I am absolutely certain that both Their Highnesses would be extremely pleased to see you.」</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>「We will make sure to inform the Lord ahead of time so that he knows of the circumstances of your visit.」</p>
<p>They’re staying over at the local lord’s place? Well, gotta give it to them. That’s royalty for you.</p>
<p>「I’d like to thank you as well. The trip was really rough, I’m pretty sure you’re the only thing that kept us from sinking.」</p>
<p>The captain offered us a word of thanks as well.<br>
「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Your abilities made this trip much more profitable than it otherwise would have been, so I owe you quite the debt. Make sure to head on over to the Luciel Conglomerate if you ever run into any sort of trouble. We’ll do whatever we can for you.」</p>
<p>「Don’t tel—」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I know. My lips are sealed, and I’ll make sure that my men feel the same way.」</p>
<p>「Our party feels the same. I will order the soldiers to keep quiet in order to prevent the spread of any undesired rumors.」</p>
<p>The whole Sword of Truth business would probably kick up a huge fuss if people ended up finding out about it. It seemed that it was considered really valuable, as both Seird and the captain had asked to purchase it. The former had even offered a whole thirty million Golde.</p>
<p>We’d end up with a huge pain in the ass if rumors of the Sword of Truth spread, so we’d even thrown in a bit of intimidation alongside our request of secrecy. Hopefully, both Serid and Captain Rengil will be able to keep their subordinates in line. Oh well, no choice but to just trust them for now.</p>
<p>Fran exchanged one last handshake with the twins before bidding them farewell.</p>
<p>Alright! I’ve made up my mind. We’ll make sure we drop by at least once, for Fran’s sake. Well, assuming that they don’t turn as away at the gate, that is.</p>
<p>「Worry not about the document. I shall personally hand it over to Barbra’s Lord.」</p>
<p>「Thanks.」</p>
<p>The document Serid was talking about was the one we found in the illegal slave trader’s hideout. We handed it over to him because well, it just kinda made sense for him to have it. He disliked Reidosians, and had enough power to influence most of Kranzel’s higher ups. There literally couldn’t have been a better person to entrust it to.</p>
<p>「Will be off now.」</p>
<p>「Thanks you, and take care of yourself.」</p>
<p>「I hope we will meet again in the future.」</p>
<p>「Bye bye.」</p>
<p>30 Minutes had passed since Fran said her farewells and made her way off the ship.</p>
<p>『That’s the place Rengil recommended.』</p>
<p>「Looks expensive.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, it’s supposed to be pretty high class.』</p>
<p>Barbra was really busy given the upcoming festival and whatnot, so we’d been concerned over how much trouble we’d have to go through in order to find a place to stay. Luckily, Captain Rengil had had more than just a few connections, and so, he directed us over to an inn owned by one of his friends. It was a bit pricey, but apparently mentioning the captains name would get us a discount. Besides, we had plenty of cash on hand anyways, so we could afford to splurge a bit. The best part about the inn we were recommended was that it allowed familiars, so poor Urushi didn’t have to spend all his time lurking around in Fran’s shadow.</p>
<p>「Hi.」</p>
<p>「Welcome.」</p>
<p>The inn really did give off a high class kind of feel. Instead of being greeted by the usual “well proportioned” old lady type clerk, we were instead received by a dandy-yet-capable looking man.</p>
<p>「Room for one.」</p>
<p>「I’m very sorry, but we don’t have any rooms available at the moment.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Here.」</p>
<p>Fran showed the man coin with the Luciel Conglomerate’s emblem inscribed upon it.</p>
<p>「Well then… Might I ask for the name of the person that introduced you to our establishment?」</p>
<p>「Captain Rengil.」</p>
<p>「I see. Please give me just a moment.」</p>
<p>Showing the man the coin had caused his attitude to take a sudden turn. Apparently, they did actually still have a room, but it was one that they refused to rent out to the general public. They typically had it reserved just in case any of their regulars showed up. Fortunately, the captain’s recommendation gave us the right to use that room as well.</p>
<p>The post-discount price was 4000 Golde per night, and included both breakfast and dinner but not lunch. One night here was literally the same price as ten nights in Alessa, but whatever. We decided to stay for five nights for the time being.</p>
<p>『Alright, looks like we’ve got ourselves a place to stay. We’re pretty much free now, so are you feeling like anything in particular?』</p>
<p>「Food.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『Sure. Oh yeah, you want to open up the treasure chests we got as bonuses first? I’m kind of curious as to what’s inside.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Was looking forward to it.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>

		<p><b>100 Revealing the Goods</b></p>
<p>『Hmm, it looks like it’s locked.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We were currently inside the room we’d rented.</p>
<p><span id="more-259"></span></p>
<p>There was a treasure chest in front of us. Needless to say, it was one of the ones we got from the pirate’s base. Its body was made of a blackened iron, and it had the Alchemist’s Guild’s crest inscribed upon it. We had planned to figure out its contents, but it didn’t seem like would immediately be able to get our hands on the chest's insides because of the mithril padlock attached to the its opening.</p>
<p>『I don’t feel any magic coming from the lock itself, but the box has got a spell woven into it. It seems like it’s preserving whatever’s inside.』</p>
<p>「Then… cut open?」</p>
<p>『I don't think that's a good idea. We don’t know what the box contains, so we might end up messing the the contents up if we just hack it open.』</p>
<p>I literally had no idea what was inside. It could be medicine, some sort of raw material, treasure, or maybe even just plain garbage. There was a chance that the items contained within could be really fragile too, meaning that the shock resulting from us breaking the lock open could end up destroying the box’s contents.</p>
<p>The other treasure chest we picked up was the type that contained exactly what you’d think it to contain. It was full of all sorts of jewels and accessories. The most expensive looking, and therefore, most interesting of the bunch was a bracelet with a massive gemstone embedded inside of it.</p>
<p>The second box probably contained something just as expensive as well.</p>
<p>「Then what?」</p>
<p>『It might take a while, but my suggestion would be to use Fang of Decay and Fang of Corrosion. That way, we should be able to slowly melt the lock down without damaging the chest’s contents..』</p>
<p>「Nn. Sounds bothersome.」</p>
<p>「Whimper…」</p>
<p>『Yeah, don’t worry about it. I’ll do it, so you guys can go eat or something.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>Wait, wait, isn’t this where they’re supposed to cut in and say something like, “Let us help, we can’t just take it easy while you do all the work?”</p>
<p>Apparently Fran didn’t even consider the thought, as she’d already began stuffing her cheeks with the hamburg steak she grabbed out of the dimensional storage.</p>
<p>Well, I guess it’s fine. It means she doesn’t really need to hold back around me, and I really do kind of like doing this thing anyway. Plus, doing it by myself lets me focus and relax more.</p>
<p>And so, I began the boring task of melting away at the mithril lock whilst watching over my two companions as they hungrily devoured their lunches. I transformed myself into a saw blade and slowly began to carve away at the padlock while also simultaneously activating both Fang of Decay and Fang of Corrosion.</p>
<p>Soon, the room was filled with not but the sounds of chewing and sawing.</p>
<p>The atmosphere lasted for about ten minutes. It came to an end right when Fran and Urushi were about to go for their fourth helpings; the rhythmic sounding saw noise was disrupted by a loud clink.</p>
<p>『I did it!』</p>
<p>I finally managed to break through the mithril padlock. Man, that was exhausting, I had to be really careful. But who cares! I managed to get the box open!</p>
<p>「Treasure?」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>『Huh, a bunch of bottles with potions inside them.』</p>
<p>「That’s it?」</p>
<p>『Oh come on, why are you already disappointed? This stuff is actually really amazing, you know?』<br>
「Nn?」</p>
<p>I picked up one of the potions and handed it to Fran. At first glance, it looked like any other Life Portion, but it was a bit more than just that.</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>『Apparently it’s the highest grade Life Potion out there.』</p>
<p>「Oh?」</p>
<p>『It’s some really effective stuff. It can even restore missing body parts so long as you don't get mangled too badly. Apparently people even go as far as to call its effects miraculous.』</p>
<p>「Ohhhh. Sounds amazing.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>They were so potent that you could basically call them elixirs. I remember High Grade Life Potions costing thirty thousand gold apiece, I can’t actually put my finger on exactly how much each of these Highest Grade ones would cost, but I figured it was safe to assume that they were at least a hundred thousand Golde each. We’ve got three bottles in total, so I’d say we raked in a pretty damn good profit.</p>
<p>「Rest are?」</p>
<p>We’ve still got another 17 bottles left in the chest. I hoped that the other potions would be just as high quality as the first ones we picked up.</p>
<p>「What’s this?」</p>
<p>『That's a Full Heal, it removes any and all abnormal status conditions.』 [1]</p>
<p>Yeah, that one seemed incredibly useful too. Like the Life Pots, they came in a batch of three.</p>
<p>『Let’s see, we’ve also got some high grade mana potions.』</p>
<p>「Total three bottles.」</p>
<p>『Let’s put one of these in each of our dimensional storage boxes. Put the last one in your potion holder.』</p>
<p>「Got it」</p>
<p>Man, we seriously did strike gold here. These potions could be really useful if we ran into any sort of emergency.</p>
<p>The next three identical looking bottles were apparently Highest Grade Alchemy Potions. I didn’t really know what they did, so I guess we should probably ask an alchemist or something later.</p>
<p>I grabbed a black, suspicious looking bottle after putting the Alchemy Potions away.</p>
<p>「Dangerous item?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, make sure you don’t touch it.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>Fran replied with a rare, serious expression on her face.</p>
<p>My Sense of Danger had been going off nonstop for quite some time now, and hence, I didn’t even need to appraise the black liquid to know that it was something that shouldn’t be touched.</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>『Stop that, Urushi.』</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>「Urushi. Down.」</p>
<p>We didn’t manage to stop Urushi in time, so he ended up giving the bottle a sniff with an intrigued look on his face.</p>
<p>「Whimper!」</p>
<p>A single whiff of the substance caused him to quickly recoil his nose before scratching it nonstop with his front paws. It looked as if the stuff in the bottle stank like hell, hence Urushi’s strong sense of smell had only worked against him.</p>
<p>「Whimper whimper!」</p>
<p>『Well, that’s a Poison Mixture of the Highest Grade for you. Urushi's more or less down and out just because of its smell.』</p>
<p>We won’t get in trouble just by carrying this around with us… will we? I’m pretty sure it’s more potent than any sort of poison produced through magic. E-Either way, best thing to do is to just seal it away by putting it inside the dimensional storage. I’m actually kinda glad that we’ve only got one of these.</p>
<p>『Alright, next… Woah! This some pretty nice stuff!』</p>
<p>The next potion I grabbed was a Potion of Repair, it was capable of fixing whatever equipment it was poured on. We could use it on either me or Fran’s Black Cat Armour depending on our needs. Too bad we only got one bottle of it. I really wish there was more.</p>
<p>Man, all these decent potions are making this whole thing pretty exciting, it really makes me wonder what’ll come next.</p>
<p>「Pretty.」</p>
<p>『That one looks more gaudy than it does pretty to me.』</p>
<p>Fran had picked up a potion with a bottle slightly more narrow than the rest. Its interior was filled with a sort of sparkling, rainbow liquid. It looked nothing but flashy, however, its effects were pretty damn good. Its name was the Potion of Rising Skill, and as implied, it had the ability to raise the level of one or more skills upon its consumption. The user had no way of choosing which skills would gain levels, and the precise number of skills that did gain levels would also be subject to random chance. We decided to save it for when Fran trained up her skills a bit more, as higher level skills took more effort to level up.</p>
<p>The Potion of Rising Skill was undoubtedly of extremely high value, but even it was considered fairly insignificant when compared to the next thing we identified.</p>
<p>『Holy shit.』</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>The next item was called the Anti-Side Effect Potion, and it had the ability to mitigate any negative side effects caused by spells and magic. In other words, it could counteract the backlash that came from skills like Latent Potential Release and Doppelganger Synthesis. If I used it on a clone, then I might even be able to actually eat.</p>
<p>Given its effects, we could probably actually just flat out use it as a trump card. Moreover, it was classified as a “magical medicine” and I didn’t even know those existed. Either way, I want more of these, so I should probably level up Alchemy and Medicine Creation some more. I should be able to make these myself one day if I get both those skills high enough.</p>
<p>There were only two bottles left in the chest, but both were so rare that I couldn’t actually figure out what they did. Appraisal refused to tell me more than just their names.</p>
<p>The two bottles were identified as the Drug of Reversed Attributes, and the Root of Arcane Souls respectively. The former looked like any other potion, so we might’ve actually just accidentally downed if not for appraisal. [2]</p>
<p>The latter looked just like an empty bottle, but the fact that a name showed up when I appraised it meant that there was definitely something inside. Was it gas or something? I didn’t really think opening it was a good idea, so we refrained.</p>
<p>Oh well, whatever. Either way, that was it. To sum things up, the results were as follows.</p>
<p>Highest Grade Life Potion * 3<br>
Full Heal * 3 [2]<br>
High Grade Mana Potion * 3<br>
Highest Grade Alchemy Potion * 3<br>
Poison Mixture of the Highest Grade * 1<br>
High Grade Potion of Repair * 1<br>
Potion of Rising Skill * 1<br>
Anti-Side Effect Potion * 3<br>
Drug of Reversed Attributes * 1<br>
Root of Arcane Souls * 1</p>
<p>Wow, we really struck it rich. The potions looked to be worth more than a million Golde in total, and we could actually put most of them to use if we wanted.</p>
<p>We should probably get the ones we didn’t know muich about checked out. Barbra was a pretty big city. Naturally, it contained a fair number of alchemists therewithin, so we should be able to find someone that knows all our portions' effects.</p>
<p>That said, I couldn’t help but feel as if asking around about this stuff would stir up a huge fuss, so it’d be best for us to be prudent. It’s not like we’re in any sort of rush here anyways.</p>
<p>「Then, ask adventurer’s guild?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good idea. We need to sell all the magic beast parts we dismantled on our way here too, so yeah, let’s head right on over.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Wanted to see city anyway.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof woof!」</p>
<p>「Urushi. Want to walk around town too?」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>The first thing he wanted to do after going somewhere new was to go out on a walk. That’s a dog for you I guess. Well, it’s fine though. I kind of wanted to see the city’s sights myself, so we might as well just explore the place while looking for the Adventurer's Guild.</p>
<p>『Alright, a walk it is then.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>

		<p><b>101. The Chef’s Guild.</b></p>
<p>Discounting the Royal Capital, Barbra was Kranzel’s largest city. Like Dharz, it bordered the sea, and thus, function as a large, commercial centre.</p>
<p>The city was so extravagantly decorated that even the guard’s office was a shocking 4 stories in height. Salrut was still accompanying the prince on his travels, albeit as a prisoner, but the pirates? Yeah, they were probably pretty much all locked up inside. Chances were, they were going to be hanged in a few days time. We technically didn't break the promise we made to the pirate's captain, as we weren't going to kill him ourselves. They were just being punished for being a bunch of unruly pirates, nothing less, nothing more.</p>
<p><span id="more-266"></span></p>
<p>Barbra’s port was massive. It housed over a hundred ships hailing from at least twenty different countries. It was such a well travelled place that it'd probably be safe to say that you could get your hands on anything you ever wanted here so long as you were willing to pay the price.</p>
<p>「Amazing.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>『Woah. There’s so many shops that I can’t decide where to start.』</p>
<p>The street leading to and from to the port was lined with stalls and shops of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>There were three different weapon shops within 200 meters of us, but a certain pair of gluttons had already dismissed them without so much as a second thought. Instead, they were looking towards the myriad of restaurants that decorated the crowded street, their eyes shining like stars in the night sky.</p>
<p>At the time, I figured that there wasn’t any issue in letting the two of them eat whatever they wanted. We had the money, so whatever.</p>
<p>Little did I know at the time, that decision had been nothing short of a mistake.</p>
<p>「Tasty.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Also tasty.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>「Nom nom nom.」</p>
<p>「Bark.」</p>
<p>It looked to me like the two of them were spending more time with their mouths stuffed than they were the opposite. Both Fran and Urushi were both holding and eating as much food as they possibly could, and needless to say, the sight of a young girl and a large black wolf shoving meal after meal down their throats was something that stood out far more than necessary. In fact, they drew so much attention that the people around us had actively started to observe our every move. They even gave Fran a round of applause after seeing her eat an entire giant skewer in a single bite.</p>
<p>Our food filled advance eventually led us to a massive square about five hundred meters in diameter.</p>
<p>The buildings constructed around said square were on a similarly grand scale; they were both massive and gaudy as could be. Their very existences served to function as a testament to their owners’ wealth. If I had to give an impression of the area, I'd say that it hit me in much in the same way as would a place like Marunouchi or Time Square. Examining the plaza further led my eyes to catch ahold of something that immediately grabbed my interest.</p>
<p>『Is that what I think it is…?』</p>
<p>（Master?）</p>
<p>『Apparently that building over there is labeled as the Chef’s Guild.』</p>
<p>I didn’t even know that such a thing actually existed. I couldn’t help but find myself staring at it in wonder, I really wanted to find out more about its activities and stuff.</p>
<p>「Want to go?」</p>
<p>『Yeah. Please and thanks.』</p>
<p>There were a lot of other big names hanging around, like the Blacksmith’s Guild and the Merchant’s Guild, just to name a few. I even caught sight of a few embassies as well. It was almost as if there was an invisible rule stating every institution located within the square was an organisation or entity that carried with it a certain degree of prestige, and I saw no reason for the Chef's Guild to be an exception thereto.</p>
<p>「Here?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, but it looks like Urushi won’t be allowed inside.』</p>
<p>A sign saying “Pets and familiars are not allowed within the premises,” was hanging from the guild’s door. Well, I guess it can’t be helped, given how food was involved.</p>
<p>（Then sink into shadow?）</p>
<p>『Yeah, should work. Make sure you don’t come out of Fran’s shadow while we’re still inside, okay, Urushi?』</p>
<p>（Whimper…）</p>
<p>Urushi let out a slightly saddened cry before obediently sinking into Fran’s shadow. He was probably hoping to enter the Chef’s Guild so he could get his paws on something tasty. We’ll have to make it up to him later.</p>
<p>「Hello.」</p>
<p>The Chef's Guild's interior design greatly resembled that of the Adventurer’s Guild. The only major difference that one could spot at first glance was that the people within the building were chefs instead of adventures.</p>
<p>「And what can we for you today, young lady?」</p>
<p>「Nothing in particular.」</p>
<p>「Huh?」</p>
<p>Fran’s exhibition of complete and brutal honesty left the guild’s clerk in a momentary state of bewilderment. That said, she did manage to recover from it quite quickly.</p>
<p>「First time here.」</p>
<p>「We don’t have too many branches, so I can understand where you’re coming from. We, the Chef’s Guild, facilitate the gathering of ingredients from across the entire continent. Many chefs even go as far as to equate the guild to the heavens. We have many connections with those within the industry, and there is a rather large demand for our services.」</p>
<p>The Guild’s receptionist was politely answering Fran’s questions despite the fact that she was just a child. She informed us that the Chef’s Guild effectively functioned as a large merchant that worked with both ingredients and chefs themselves. The guild would accept registration from two different types of individuals. The first was obviously chefs and the second, the owners of businesses that required them. The guild started out as a small organisation focused around the discovery of new recipes, and it has followed through with that fundamental philosophy throughout its history. Even now, the guild apparently continued to extend its arms to any and all chefs in need of support.</p>
<p>「Are you perhaps a chef yourself?」</p>
<p>「Kind of?」</p>
<p>Fran was stuck in a weird situation in which she never actually cooked despite her cooking skill completely maxed out.</p>
<p>「Master, good at cooking.」</p>
<p>「I see. And I take it that your Master is not one of our guild’s members?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I believe that registering may be in your Master’s best interest. We provide a wide variety of benefits, especially in the realm of buying and selling recipes and ingredients.」</p>
<p>Oh, that’s pretty interesting, but I’m kind of a sword, so I can’t actually register myself. Fran could probably do it, but she’s a part of the Adventurer’s Guild as well, so I wasn’t really sure if she was disallowed or something as a result.</p>
<p>「Oh, don’t worry about that. A fair number of our members are in that precise situation; they belong to several guilds simultaneously. That said, I do have to say that the Chef’s Guild isn’t nearly as big as the Adventurer’s Guild, and unlike the Adventurer’s Guild, we don’t intentionally restrict our members in any which way. The Chef’s Guild is much more lax in general, as fundamentally, we stemmed from an organisation established for the sole sake of helping one another.」</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Want to register.」</p>
<p>「Are you legally authorized to do business in Barbra?」</p>
<p>「Nn? No.」</p>
<p>「In that case, you’ll have to register as a chef.」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>「You will have to participate in an examination. Is that okay?」</p>
<p>「Exam? What kind?」</p>
<p>「Well, we are the Chef’s Guild, so you’ll have to cook. We’ll consider you have to passed the examination if you can get our staff judges to approve of any one of your dishes. We have a kitchen available if you’d like to whip something up right away, but using it isn't mandatory. If you want, you can cook something up ahead of time and then just bring it on over.」</p>
<p>Does that mean that I can make something and then get Fran register for me by proxy?</p>
<p>「Yes, that would be fine. Our guild cards don’t require anything beyond just a name.」</p>
<p>Wow, they really were lax. The word guild always made me think of something really systematic and strict, but apparently the Chef’s Guild wasn’t like that at all. Signing up here seemed almost as casual as signing up for any sort of membership or point card back in Japan.</p>
<p>「Something already made okay for exam?」</p>
<p>「Well, yes, but…」</p>
<p>「Then this. And this.」</p>
<p>「Huh? Oh, I see, you had an item box.」</p>
<p>Fran had pulled out from her dimensional storage a serving of curry and a skewer made of wild boar meat. Their spices’ fragrances drifted across the room and grabbed the attention of all the chefs there within.</p>
<p>Fran actually did make the skewer herself, so we technically weren’t cheating.</p>
<p>『I know that they’re going to be judging us, but are you sure you want to offer them curry? That’s one less plate for you, you know?』</p>
<p>The hell is going on here? She normally hates sharing her curry.</p>
<p>（Masters cooking will be judged. Can’t show inferior products. Need to blow judges out of the water.）</p>
<p>『O-Oh I see. Thanks.』</p>
<p>「I-I’ll go get an examiner right away.」</p>
<p>「Nn? You’re not a judge?」</p>
<p>「The higher ups are supposed to participate in the judging just to make sure all our members meet the same standard of quality.」</p>
<p>Five minutes later, the receptionist came back with a man in tow. If I had to sum said man up, I’d say he more or less looked like a gourmet that was nothing short of difficult to please. He was totally rocking the Kaibara Y*zan and Aji**u feel. Just seeing him kind of made me start to feel nervous.</p>
<p>「Oh? So you’re the applicant?」</p>
<p>「Nn. This, my cooking.」</p>
<p>「Grilled meat on a skewer? Hmm… I see. Well then, I’ll give it a sample.」</p>
<p>The man took a bite out of the skewer. He slowly chewed through it and savoured its flavour before finally swallowing it with a gulp. The fact that he stayed expressionless throughout the whole process left me feeling a bit intimidated.</p>
<p>「Hmm… It’s quite plain.」</p>
<p>「Can’t be helped.」</p>
<p>Fran had a pretty solid grasp of where her own cooking skills laid, so she didn’t really get angry despite the fact that they were criticized. She only made the dish on a whim anyways.</p>
<p>「However, I can’t say I disapprove of its flavour. I can feel your fervor and passionate temperament through its taste. It’s as if the dish itself is telling me that you tried to make it as delicious as possible with what limited materials you had access to.</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>Wow, he actually knows what he’s talking about. The skewer he was eating was indeed something that Fran made on a whim, but that didn’t mean she didn’t give it her all.</p>
<p>It was a dish that she carefully roasted with fire magic over the course of about thirty minutes. She didn’t use any special ingredients or spices to make it either, she just grabbed whatever she happened to have available and gave it her best effort. Despite her relative lack of ingredients, she took her time and managed to make the final product taste pretty good. However, it was also actually this precise careful process that caused her to lose interest in cooking, as she ended up equating it to a meticulous and almost painful process.</p>
<p>The examiner had been so skillful and observant that he was able to deduce her efforts but from a single bite. Seriously, wow.</p>
<p>「I approve of your dish, you pass.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Whew, she passed. Given how Fran managed to pass with nothing but a skewer of meat, I figured that I shouldn’t have any issues passing either. That said, I didn't really think that there was any point in having me register anymore, as we’d already secured the benefits we needed.</p>
<p>（No. Can’t not register.）</p>
<p>『Why not?』</p>
<p>（Make them eat Master’s cooking. Blow their minds.）</p>
<p>It seemed like she didn’t actually care about the benefits, she just wanted to completely bewilder the stuck-up looking judge by feeding him a plateful of curry.</p>
<p>「Next, this.」</p>
<p>「What an interesting dish. Its appearance reminds me Azerian cuisine, but its fragrance is of a much more mellow quality, and its ingredients stray from the Azerian norm.」</p>
<p>「Called curry. Made by Master.」</p>
<p>「So I take it that this is one of your Master’s original creations?」</p>
<p>「Yes. The ultimate dish, crafted from years of blood and effort.」</p>
<p>What, no! Nonononono! All I did was reproduce one of Earth’s most common dishes! It’s nothing complicated, and I only decided to make it because it’s easy given that we had all the necessary spices on hand!</p>
<p>「Oh? I look forward to trying it then.」</p>
<p>「Tastiest thing in the world is curry.」</p>
<p>「I would be quite glad if that were to be the truth.」</p>
<p>The old gourmet judge raised the dish to his mouth and consumed a bite after listening to Fran hype it up.</p>
<p>「Oh?」</p>
<p>「Tasty.」</p>
<p>「Hmm…」</p>
<p>「Ultimate dish.」</p>
<p>Fran couldn’t stand just watching, so she pulled out another plate and began eating it alongside the judge whilst watching him with a look of confidence. Her expression gave way to the fact that she was absolutely sure he would be blown away by the flavour.</p>
<p>「It’s not bad.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Of course.」</p>
<p>「But did you really think that a dish with this meager a flavour would stand above else all that the world has to offer?」</p>
<p>The moment the man uttered his response, Fran completely froze over.</p>
<p>「Hah?」</p>
<p>Her expression vanished altogether, and she immediately began to radiate an aura of violent bloodlust.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>TN: Sorry, this should've come out earlier, but my water heater broke. You know how much asian people like their hot baths, and conversely how much we hate the lack thereof? Well, you're reading a web novel right now, so I assume you do. I finally got all that done and fixed last night, but then Pokken Tournament DX arrived in the mail…(๑≧౪≦)</p>
					
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>102. Wait, We Skipped the First Round Altogether?</b></p>
<p>Hearing the gourmet criticize her favourite dish caused Fran to emit far more bloodthirst than she had ever displayed on the battlefield.</p>
<p>She further went on to activate her Intimidation skill and funneled both it and entirety of her bloodlust towards the judge. I was pretty worried for the guy. There was so much pressure that an ordinary civilian would likely have passed out, pissed themselves, or maybe even something worse than prior options combined.</p>
<p><span id="more-274"></span></p>
<p>「Curry. Tastiest thing ever.」</p>
<p>「Well, I do admit that it is quite delicious, but it’s most definitely not the most delicious thing in the world.」</p>
<p>Holy crap. Dude looks like he’s a middle aged man, but damn, he’s got balls. Fran’s thirst for blood didn’t make him even anywhere close to fainting. In fact, he just casually raised an eyebrow whilst responding to her as if it wasn't a big deal at all. And I don't mean that he's just naturally the calm type of guy or anything like that either. He wasn’t half assing it and just throwing up a front, and he wasn't just naturally unconcerned with this type of thing, he genuinely just didn’t care.</p>
<p>I guess that’s just how people who’ve mastered their trades end up turning out, regardless of what those trades happen to be.</p>
<p>『Fran, calm down.』</p>
<p>（Already calm!）</p>
<p>『I’m only telling you to calm down because you're clearly agitated. Why don’t you just ask him why he feels the way he does? You might be able to accept his thoughts once you come to understand them, so let go of me already!』</p>
<p>「Nn. Why?」</p>
<p>She asked the question in a bit of an egotistical tone. It looked like Fran had already started to think of him as a sort of enemy. I just hope that she doesn’t actually attack him.</p>
<p>「The taste of the dish itself serves to prove that it is near completion. There is little room left for the improvement of its flavour, and it carries with it a unique fragrance the likes of which I myself had never before sampled. I will admit that it was very well crafted. However, that is all. This dish completely fails to provide with it its creator’s dignity!」</p>
<p>「Dignity?」</p>
<p>「Dignity refers to the chef’s spirit, their passion and pride. Dignity is something that all chefs carry with them at all times, it's what must be poured into their craft. This dish lacks even the slightest sense of dictinity. It was made with care, but it fails to extend beyond the realm of one's home cooking.」</p>
<p>You know, he is actually right. All I wanted was to make Fran food that she’d find delicious, and I never really shot for anything more than just that. I ended up making it all en masse, and I was honestly only careful enough to make sure that it didn’t burn. I never really thought of making the best dish ever or anything like that at all.</p>
<p>In other words, the final product was basically a dish made by an amateur that just so happened to have the skill required to cook. Yeah, this dude, he really knows his stuff. I almost can’t believe that he was able to see through me with such ease. Fran seems to think of him as a sort of enemy, but I don’t really feel any hostility towards him at all. In fact, I’d say that I think he’s a pretty cool guy.</p>
<p>「Grrr.」</p>
<p>Fran grumbled in response to the man's words.</p>
<p>「Well, either way, a pass is a pass. I will admit the person you call your Master to the guild, though I have very few expectations of him.」</p>
<p>「Will not acknowledge.」</p>
<p>「Oh?」</p>
<p>「Curry is the best. Absolute best. Next time, will make you admit it.」</p>
<p>「That’s an interesting remark. However, I’m quite a bit busier than I look. You won’t be able to get me to show up whenever you so please, especially seeing as how I’m going to be even busier than usual starting tomorrow.」</p>
<p>「Mrrrgghhh」</p>
<p>Eh, we got a pass, so whatever. It doesn’t really matter anymore, does it?</p>
<p>（It does!）</p>
<p>『It can’t really be helped. He’s got things to do too.』</p>
<p>（Curry is best food. Refuse to acknowledge any other. Need to prove.）</p>
<p>『Well, alright. If that’s what you want.』</p>
<p>「How to meet with you?」</p>
<p>「Hmm… Well, if you’d like me to evaluate another dish, then why not register for this?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The middle aged man of a gourmet handed Fran a single pamphlet, the headline of which was “King of Cooking – A Contest Sponsored by Barbra’s Chef’s Guild.”</p>
<p>According to the pamphlet, the first round allowed you to bring your food in ahead of time for it to be judged. The second round was a competition based on food carts. The last round and climax was supposed to be a match between the finalist's best dishes.</p>
<p>「We’re currently in the midst of the first round. The dish’s taste and uniqueness justifies it passing through to the second. If you can make it all the way to the end, then you’ll be able to force me to try your cooking. I will be the sole judge of the final round.」</p>
<p>「Will participate!」</p>
<p>『Wait a sec! At least say something to me before you just go off and declare that!』</p>
<p>The second round consists of setting up a food cart, and Fran isn’t exactly what you’d call a model salesgirl. Besides, the old dude isn’t actually going to be sampling anything until the finals, and it wouldn’t make sense for me to not actually show up to the finals in person. Fran herself can't make curry, so I'd probably have to unless she was planning to learn how to make it? I doubt we’d be able to pull any sort of trick given his sense of taste, and this really isn’t something that can be even remotely close to brute forced.</p>
<p>（Will definiately participate.）</p>
<p>『All the people who enter are going to be people who are good at cooking. Do you really think we’ll be able to make it to the finals?』</p>
<p>（No worries. Master can definitely make it.）</p>
<p>『I’m happy to hear you say that, but…』</p>
<p>Honestly, I don’t think that the idea of making it all the way to the finals is all that realistic. A good chunk of the participants were probably people who’d been chefs for over a decade, and I figured that it’d be fair to conclude that most of them were pretty damned good at what they did.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>（Refuse to back off or lose. Curry equals pride.）</p>
<p>『I get what you’re trying to say, but…』</p>
<p>I honestly had no self confidence whatsoever.</p>
<p>（No worries. I believe in you, Master.）</p>
<p>『I really don’t feel like I can do it. I mean, I have the skill maxed, but deep down, I’m honestly just an amateur.』</p>
<p>（Don’t believe in my sense of taste?）</p>
<p>『Well, I mean, I do.』</p>
<p>Fran really likes eating. The max level cooking skill we share only helps to amplify her sense of taste even further, so, she definitely knows what tastes good and what doesn’t, and she isn't the type to flatter. Her thoughts and impressions are genuine and her opinion has weight to it.</p>
<p>The issue wasn't actually related to any of that. All my problems came from that whole best in the world thing. I myself was having some trouble picturing curry as the world's best ever creation.</p>
<p>（Then, believe in the me that believes in you, Master.）</p>
<p>『That was a pretty good line you said just now.』</p>
<p>God damn. That was number three on the list of things I really wanted to say at least once. Man, I’m jealous! Why did she get to say it! Argggg, Fran is terrifying at times like these.</p>
<p>『Alright, alright. If you’re going as far as to say something like that, then I can’t really say no to you.』</p>
<p>（Then participating is okay?）</p>
<p>『Yeah, let’s go get ourselves that championship.』</p>
<p>（Yes Master.）</p>
<p>「What’s wrong? Lost your nerves?」</p>
<p>「Nope. Just getting fired up. Will definitely win.」</p>
<p>「So you will be participating then?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Then read over the rules and sign them.」</p>
<p>The old man then called over one of the people in charge of the competition and had them explain any relevant details to us.</p>
<p>The first round had over 2000 participants, but only twenty would move on to the second. We were pretty lucky to be instantly selected as one of said twenty.</p>
<p>The second round was to last three days, and its whole premise was to see who could profit the most by wheeling a cart around and selling food. All the entrants were given a hundred thousand Golde as their starting capital. The sheer amount of money given to each individual really served to evidence that the contest's scale.</p>
<p>You were allowed to bring your own ingredients if you wanted as well. Apparently that rule was made because some of the chefs would only work with super high end stuff, and a hundred thousand Golde wasn’t anywhere close enough to what they needed to get going.</p>
<p>The only condition was that you needed to tell the contest’s staff ahead of time. The ingredient cost was still going to be detracted from one’s profits regardless, so it didn’t actually really work to create any advantages for those that had their own stuff. After all, the point wasn’t just to sell as much as possible, it was to profit as much as possible.</p>
<p>The four chefs with the best profits would be able to move on to the competition’s final round, in which they’d each present their very best dishes.</p>
<p>The winner would be rewarded a hundred thousand Golde. Honestly, the prize money alone wasn’t all that appealing. It was literally exactly the same amount as what was given for the second round’s preparations. But to the chefs, that was fine. What mattered was the honor and fame that came with one’s victory, not the immediate monetary gain. Those that won would ultimately prosper down the road anyways due to the prestige that came with the event. Many of the competition’s previous winners had even been granted positions in which they answered directly to royalty.</p>
<p>「The second round will begin in three days, and the finals on the 7th of April.」</p>
<p>The Lunar Banquet was set to span a week starting on the 31st, meaning that the finals would take place on its last day.</p>
<p>「Will you be able to complete all necessary preparations in time for the event?」</p>
<p>（Master?）</p>
<p>『It should be fine. We’ll manage one way or another.』</p>
<p>「Nn. No problems at all.」</p>
<p>「Very well. Then here is one hundred thousand gold. Use it to ready yourself for the second round, and don’t be making off with it.」</p>
<p>「Won’t. You, get noose ready, await your loss.」</p>
<p>「I’ll be looking forward to seeing the results of your efforts.」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>And so, we somehow ended up participating in a cooking contest.</p>
<p>We needed a kitchen in which we could operate. They said that we could always just use the one they had here, but that would mean people seeing me in action, which wasn’t exactly a good thing. We needed a place in which we could maintain secrecy whilst preparing our dishes. I also need to think about the type of curry I was going to make, so we could get all our supplies ready. Luckily, we still had a tonne of spices on hand.</p>
<p>There was, however, a problem. We still had a mountain load of stuff to do in the meantime. We needed to drop in on the Adventurer’s guild, find a knowledgeable alchemist, and even visit the twins sometime or another.</p>
<p>I know I said that we’d manage somehow, but man, it really seems like we’re not going to have enough time for all this…</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>TN: If you’re wondering why I use middle aged and old interchangably, it’s because I call middle aged people old. The definition is vague, and some people classify 60 as like middle aged while others say that’s old as hell. I’ve tried to avoid shifting between the two it but it might’ve still leaked through to the chapter like it did the last. In other words, the description of the gourmand guy is vague and he could be anywhere from 30-65. Yay loose definitions!</p>
					
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>103. Colbert.</b></p>
<p>We arrived at the Adventurer’s Guild about an hour after signing up for the cooking contest.</p>
<p>I’d wanted to explore the town a bit more, but we didn’t have the time for that. We had to quickly get everything over with so I could find a place to cook.</p>
<p><span id="more-282"></span></p>
<p>『Alright, let’s hurry up and sell everything. Once we get that done, we should be able to ask them if they happen to know where we could find information on alchemy. If we’re lucky, they might also be able to help us find a location in which we can cook in private.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『You don’t mind if we hold onto the silver, gold, and gems for now, right?』</p>
<p>I was planning keeping them for the time being just in case we happened to run into a situation in which we couldn’t use Golde.</p>
<p>「Guild over there?」</p>
<p>『Seems like it… Wait, holy crap, it’s massive!』</p>
<p>「Really big.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Alessa’s Guild was pretty big already, but Barbra’s was on a whole ‘nother scale. The building was so large and fancy that I almost mistook it for a noble’s manor.</p>
<p>「Castle?」</p>
<p>『It really does look like one.』</p>
<p>But surely enough, a sign indicating that this was indeed the Adventurer’s Guild was hanging up atop the building’s entrance.</p>
<p>The guild's exterior was gorgeous, but its inside? Not so much. If anything, they almost seemed shoddy in comparison. Well, I guess it did make sense. Not all adventurers were lawful people. In fact, a fairly significant portion were precisely the opposite, and hence, it was always possible for fancy furniture to get damaged or even stolen.</p>
<p>There were seven different desks and at least fifty adventurers within the building as we entered it. At first, I’d thought that there was some sort of emergency gathering or something, but apparently this was normal. Understanding that fact really made me come to see the Barbra branch’s scale.</p>
<p>「Welcome, is this your first time here?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Would you like me to quickly go over everything then?」</p>
<p>「Please.」</p>
<p>「Alright, in that case, I’ll first tell you about the different counters and their purposes. You’re currently standing at the information desk. Here, we provide with information about the guild and its facilities. We can also help if you wish to contact any specific individuals within the building.」</p>
<p>Apparently the three counters beside us were all for handling requests, and the other three were for the purchasing and exchange of materials.</p>
<p>The upper floors contained a sort of library filled with reference materials alongside an office for the guild’s staff. There were even a bunch of facilities for people new to the industry, they had training rooms and extra bedrooms too. The rooms were apparently really small, so I doubted that we’d get any use out of them, but newbies would probably be happy just to have them.</p>
<p>「Large building. Reasons now clear.」</p>
<p>「So what did you need?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Want to sell materials.」</p>
<p>「Do you have an adventurer’s card?」</p>
<p>「Here.」</p>
<p>「Just give me a moment to run it through the necessary checks.」</p>
<p>I was expecting the receptionist to do the usual thing and react to the discrepancy between Fran’s rank and age, but she didn’t.</p>
<p>「Fran, D ranked adventurer, is it? Okay, please proceed to the desk labeled with the number 6.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>In fact, her expression didn’t change at all. She simply did her job pointed Fran in the right direction without any sort of hassle. I think this is actually the first time this has happened to us. I really got to give it to the Barbra branch, they trained their employees pretty damn well.</p>
<p>The receptionist at the purchasing counter was the same. She also just casually did her job without showing the slightest bit of shock or surprise.</p>
<p>At first, I thought I liked their attitudes, but further exposure led me to feel like they were acting <i>too</i> calm. Their complete lack of a reaction left me feeling a bit unsatisfied.</p>
<p>The adventurers around us provided a much more normal reaction. Unlike the receptionists, they immediately kicked up a commotion the moment Fran pulled the Dreadnought Destroyer’s horn out of storage.</p>
<p>In the end, we managed to get fifty thousand Golde out of all the stuff we gathered while we were out at sea. Most of what we picked up was rather cheap, the only item with a notable price was the Dreadnought Destroyer’s horn, as it could be used in the crafting of weapons. The receptionist asked if we would like to sell the rest of the Dreadnought Destroyer as well, but we ended up turning her down. Fran liked how the Dreadnought Destroyer tasted, and both its flesh and bones could be used to make food.</p>
<p>A male adventurer approached the desk right as we were getting paid.<br>

<p>He looked pretty strong. He wasn’t as strong as Jean, but his stats were higher than Donadorondo’s, so he was probably at least a C rank.</p>
<p>That Qigong skill of his looked pretty interesting. Apparently, it used magical power in order to strengthen a part of one’s body. In other words, it was a skill applicable both in offense and defense. It allowed him to fight against bladed weapons with just his bare hands.</p>
<p>His Iron Fist skill caught my eye as well. The combination of that skill and his ability to use martial arts looked like they worked pretty well together. I really wanted to see him in action; I could already imagine a manga-like scene playing out in my head.</p>
<p>「Hey there little miss. Did you catch that all by yourself?」</p>
<p>His choice of words made it seem like he was trying to mock Fran, but neither his tone nor expression gave off that sort of impression at all. It looked like he was honestly curious as to whether or not she’d defeated the Dreadnought Destroyer all by her lonesome.</p>
<p>「Nn. Fished it.」</p>
<p>「What? You fished it?」</p>
<p>「Fished during boat trip.」</p>
<p>「That’s amazing! People normally beat them by bombarding them with magic.」</p>
<p>Huh, I thought he was going to get suspicious, but he actually straight up just believed us.</p>

</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>「Believe me?」</p>
<p>「Huh? Oh, yeah, of course. I mean, anyone that isn’t blind can tell at a glance that you’re pretty skilled just based on how you move your feet and how you carry yourself.」</p>
<p>Several adventurers averted their gazes in embarrassment in response to Colbert’s words. Looks like we’ve got a few people in need of guide dogs around these parts.</p>
<p>「Dreadnought Destroyers are one of my favourite foods, but they’re fairly rare, so it’s quite hard for me to get my hands on them. Would you mind selling me a bit of its meat? If you fished it, then you probably have quite the amount.」</p>
<p>「Won’t sell.」</p>
<p>「Have you already arranged to have it sold elsewhere?」</p>
<p>「Nn? Will eat myself.」</p>
<p>「All of it?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I see… What a shame…」</p>
<p>The man responded with a disappointed frown, it seemed like he really wanted to eat Dreadnought Destroyer. I couldn’t help but feel a bit sorry for him. He did recognize Fran’s abilities, so I didn’t really see much harm in sharing a slight bit with him.</p>
<p>Fran pulled something out from her storage space and held it in front the man right as I finished thinking the thought through.</p>
<p>「Here. Will give this. Dreadnought Destroyer nigirizushi.」</p>
<p>She gave him a small box of sushi with soy sauce already dribbled all over its contents. It was one of the ones I prepared while we were still on the ship, and it was made so that it could be eaten at any given time. The box's exterior almost perfectly resembled the containers that I always saw drunk salarymen carrying around.</p>
<p>『You sure you’re okay with that? Didn’t you really like sushi?』</p>
<p>（Can’t be helped. For publicity.）</p>
<p>『Publicity? What?』</p>
<p>「Did you make that?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Master made it.」</p>
<p>Well, technically, I borrowed her body in order to make them, so she could’ve just said that she made them herself.</p>
<p>「I’ve never seen anything prepared like this before. You said it was called nigirizushi?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Colbert timidly took a piece of sushi out of the box Fran presented to him and threw it in his mouth after a moment of hesitation.</p>
<p>「Chew chew chew.」</p>
<p>「Nom nom nom.」</p>
<p>Fran followed up on his action by stuffing three pieces into her own mouth immediately.</p>
<p>「H-How delicious! What delectable taste! J-Just what is this!? It’s far more than just a slice of meat placed atop a portion of rice! In fact, the fish itself can’t even be said to have simply been sliced! The sharpness of the blade used managed to completely sever each piece without crushing even the slightest bit of the flesh. The complete lack of deterioration resulting from the Dreadnought’s Destroyer’s careful dissection drew out every single last bit of its flavour! And the rice, the rice is more than just a bundle of carbohydrates squished together to form a shape! The slightly acidic substance added to the grains in the careful compression process melts in your mouth and causes its deliciousness to spread throughout the entirety of my being. This dish functions to define the very meaning of fine cuisine. You called it… nigirizushi? Yes, yes, I see! The very act of molding the the rice is none other than an iterative refinement of the cooking process as a whole.」 [1]</p>
<p>Er, holy crap. He just ended up making a speech. I mean, I saw that he had the skill required to cook, so I figured he’d probably be interested in the dish, but man, I did not expect <i>that</i>. Both him and the judge guy we ran into earlier really liked to give their impressions of the stuff we made. Is everyone in Barbra like this? I really hope I don’t get used to being around this type of person.</p>
<p>「Y-Young lady, you said that your master was the one who made the dish?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「He must be this world's greatest chef… Does he perhaps own a restaurant?」</p>
<p>Colbert suddenly started speaking in a super polite fashion.</p>
<p>「No.」</p>
<p>「Then, is he currently employed by another?」</p>
<p>「No.」</p>
<p>「Then wherever will I have to venture to consume another one of the Master’s dishes?」</p>
<p>「Will have a cart for the cooking contest.」</p>
<p>「I see! So that means that he’s already completed the first round. But of course he would, his skills are simply sublime. But thank you, I will make sure I visit on at least one occasion. Rather, I will visit him on every possible occasion. What sort of dish exactly is he preparing for the competition?」</p>
<p>「Curry.」</p>
<p>「I’ve never even heard of it. W-Would it happen to be another one of the Master’s original recipes?」</p>
<p>「Yup.」</p>
<p>「Amazing! I simply cannot wait to discover its flavour!」</p>
<p>Ohhhh, so this is what Fran was aiming for. She managed to get a high ranked adventurer to stir up a commotion in order to provide us with what was basically an advertisement. I have to admit, that was pretty good scheme right there.</p>
<p>「Right, I should introduce myself. I’m a B ranked adventurer, they call me Ironclaw Colbert.」</p>
<p>「Ironclaw?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, that’s my alias. As of the moment, I still fail to match up to people like Amando of Hariti, Hundredblade Forrund, or Jean Dovy the Annihilator. However, one day, I’ll be famous enough for my name to be known throughout the land.」</p>
<p>Aliases were a thing? Oh, right, I remember now. People used to call Fran the Magical Sword Girl, and I did know about Amanda’s whole Hariti thing as well. I mean, hers fit her perfectly. She liked kids so much that she was on the verge of having some sort of disorder. I never would’ve imagined Jean having the alias The Annihilator though. It seemed a bit too violent for him.</p>
<p>「D rank adventurer. Fran.」</p>
<p>「Oh? You’re a D rank? It looks like you’ll turn out quite promising later on down the road. Anyways, I really need to thank you for sharing your nigirizushi with me. It was so delicious that I can’t help but feel like it changed my life in its entirety.」</p>
<p>「Understanding value of nigirizushi means insightful. Very promising.」</p>
<p>「Hahaha. Thanks, thanks. You must be quite the chef yourself given your Master’s skill, so hearing your praise makes me feel a slight bit embarrassed.」</p>
<p>The two exchanged a firm handshake. It looked like they got along pretty well with one another.</p>
<p>「Don’t hesitate to let me know if you ever need any help. I’ve actually got quite a bit of influence, so I can say for sure that I won’t let you down. I’d be very much honoured if said help ended up benefitting your Master as well.」</p>
<p>And so, I randomly managed to get myself a fan. He seems like he’s a pretty good guy too.</p>
<p>Meeting him made me realize that all the high ranked adventurers were actually a bit weird and quirky. I really have to make sure Fran learns all about common sense before she ends like them. Though, to do that, I’d probably have to learn more about this world’s common sense myself first.</p>

		<p><b>104. Eugene</b></p>
<p>We headed over to the guild’s third floor after getting paid.</p>
<p>After selling materials, we had asked the guild if they knew any alchemists that could give us a hand, and apparently, they knew just the guy. The guild’s Barbra branch had contracted a fairly skilled alchemist to work within it, and he happened to be present, so we decided to pay him a visit right away.</p>
<p><span id="more-290"></span></p>
<p>We were guided to our destination by an elf. Though she was apparently 50 years old, she looked like she was in her late teens or early twenties. The door she knocked on had a sign on it describing it as “Eugene’s Laboratory,” and it was located in an area that seemed to contain facilities that one would use to produce all sorts of different items and consumables.</p>
<p>「Come in.」</p>
<p>「Please excuse our intrusion.」</p>
<p>Inside the room was a single man with his arms outstretched. He was at the age where his hair had started to grey, but despite that, he wore it with a swept back style and allowed it to grow to such a length that it extended all the way down to his back. His thin but tall body was decorated with a loose robe, and his face a gentle smile. The round glasses atop his nose really worked well the rest of his image and assisted in giving him him an intellectual sort of feel.</p>
<p>His eyes were a bit weird though, the whites were black, and the irises green. It also looked like there was some feeler-like thingy growing out of his receding hairline.</p>
<p>「Good afternoon Dr. Eugene, I’ve brought someone that wanted to see you.」</p>
<p>「Oh? What a cute little lady we have here. Are you an adventurer?」</p>
<p>「Nn. D rank adventurer. Fran.」</p>
<p>「D rank? That’s quite impressive.」<br>

<p>He was a bugman, the insect equivalent of a beastman. His appearance led me to assume that bugmen were likely characterized by their eyes and antennas. That said, he was technically only a half blood, meaning he didn’t exhibit all the traits that’d normally be associated with bugmen. Still, his outward appearance was unique enough for me to make me really curious as to how full fledged bugmen looked.</p>
<p>But oh well, whatever. His appearance wasn’t important. What mattered was that he actually seemed just as skilled as the guild had said he was. His titles were self evident, and further proof of his abilities was provided by the fact that he’d not only completely maxed out alchemy, but even moved on to leveling up transmutation. Based on what I read in the skill description, transmutation was to alchemy what divine sword arts were to regular sword arts, a flat out improvement. There was also the whole characterization that he had going for him. It practically screamed master alchemist at the top of its lungs.</p>
<p>「Okay, why don’t I introduce myself? My name is Eugene, an alchemist that has contracted the entirety of his services to the Adventurer’s Guild.」</p>
<p>「Not in Alchemist’s Guild?」</p>
<p>「Hahaha, I did used to be a part of it, however, one of my disciples had ended up causing a scandal, so I had to take responsibility for his actions and resign from my position. I was picked up by the Adventurer’s Guild shortly after.」</p>
<p>「It’s not the Doctor’s fault at all though. The apprentice that caused the scandal was one that’d already left his care.」</p>
<p>「That doesn’t change the fact that he committed a crime through the application knowledge he obtained from my teachings.」</p>
<p>「I still think that the Alchemist’s Guild went too far. It really didn’t merit confiscating your membership.」</p>
<p>The elf replied to Eugene’s acceptance of his punishment with an unhappy look on her face.</p>
<p>「Doctor. Leaving Alchemist’s Guild for Adventurer’s Guild. Didn’t cause bad blood?」</p>
<p>Fran’s doubt was a sensible one. Most people probably wouldn’t exactly be what you’d call happy if someone they kicked out immediately managed to find their way into another organisation.</p>
<p>「It definitely did. The Alchemist’s Guild’s last Guild Master harassed me every single day until he retired.」</p>
<p>「I think the current Guild Master took up his position about five years ago. He’s not nearly as extreme as the last one.」</p>
<p>「That isn’t to say that there isn’t any sort of residual resentment anymore though. Many alchemists still feel hostility towards adventurers.」</p>
<p>Apparently, Eugene’s recruitment had even damaged the relationship between the two guilds.</p>
<p>「Adventurers dislike you?」</p>
<p>If the two guilds started antagonizing each other, then it’d mean that adventurers would have a hard time getting a lot of the items they needed to go out and do their jobs, which, in turn, would likely led to adventurers disliking Eugene as well.</p>
<p>「I don’t think so. If anything, I think most of the adventurers are glad that the Doctor joined our ranks.」</p>
<p>「Why?」</p>
<p>「The doctor’s been teaching alchemy to some of the guild’s other members, and as a result, we’ve gained the ability to produce our own proprietary goods. In other words, we managed to eliminate the Alchemist’s Guild’s monopoly, and thus, their ability to control the market. Many items are actually even cheaper than they used to be, so it’s actually much easier for adventurers to get their hands on them.」</p>
<p>「Though that’s likely why so many alchemists are feeling bitter about the matter.」</p>
<p>So that’s how it is. I admit that I do pity Eugene a bit, but I can’t say his situation isn’t one that’s to our benefit. I was a bit worried that information about us would end up getting leaked if we took our questions to the Alchemist’s Guild. Moreover, the items we’d obtained had come from pirates, so there was also always the possibility that they’d ask us to return them. Having someone that’s a part of the Adventurer’s Guild do everything for us instead reduced both those risks by a lot. It looked like the guild really trusted the doctor, so things were looking up. All knowledge of the items in our possession would probably stay a secret.</p>
<p>We were asked to sit shortly after our guide had left the room and returned to her regular duties.</p>
<p>「How would you feel about a cup of tea before we get down to business?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Thanks.」</p>
<p>The cup Fran was given was filled with a darkened liquid that bore a slight resemblance to Oolong Tea.</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran immediately picked up the cup and give it a small sip. It looked like she wanted to keep drinking, but she was black cat beastman and thus, her tongue was rather sensitive to heat. [1]</p>
<p>「Oh? You’re not going to react at all?」</p>
<p>Eugene looked at Fran with a bit of an inquisitive expression. Wait, why? Was the tea supposed to be poisoned or something? Nah, no way. Appraisal said it was just a regular cup of Oobow tea. Fran’s status was perfectly normal too, so…</p>
<p>「Ah, right, I should probably explain. I really like the flavour of that tea, but it seems that most that’ve tried it found it too bitter, and some would even spit it back out immediately. Lately, I’ve started to find people’s reactions to its taste to be something of interest. It seems however, like you don't dislike the taste.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Tasty.」</p>
<p>「I’m glad to hear it! Not many people can find themselves able to appreciate its flavour.」</p>
<p>Oh, I get it. It’s kind of like Senburi tea. People who like it love it, but the people who don’t can’t stand it at all.</p>
<p>「Bitter but tasty.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, exactly! I'm glad you feel the same way. Would you like to take some tea leaves with you?」</p>
<p>「Please.」</p>
<p>Eugene happily handed Fran a bag of tea leaves. He really did seem happy that he managed to find someone else who liked the tea’s flavour.</p>
<p>「Now then, why don’t we get down to business?」</p>
<p>「Want you to look at some items.」</p>
<p>「Oh?」</p>
<p>「But don’t want you to tell anyone else. If possible.」</p>
<p>「That’s fine. Lots of people have requested the same before, and I’m proud to say that I’ve managed to keep everything confidential.」</p>
<p>『The doctor isn’t lying. It looks like you can trust him.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Examine these.」</p>
<p>We already knew enough about the the Highest Grade Life Potions, the Panaceas, and the High Grade Mana Potions, so we didn’t bother having him tell us about them. We intended to have him look through the rest, so we started with the less harmful looking ones at the forefront.</p>
<p>「Is that a High Grade Potion of Repair? That’s quite the item you’ve got there.」</p>
<p>「Want to know its value.」</p>
<p>「Hmmm… If you were to purchase that at a store, it’d normally run you about twenty thousand Golde.」</p>
<p>Well, that’s more than I was expecting.</p>
<p>「It’s a bit on the pricey side, but it’s effect is well worth it. It can allow you to repair your equipment even if you’re out in the middle of adventuring It even has the ability to repair magic weapons, which are typically known to be quite difficult to fix.」</p>
<p>Yeah, it definitely was convenient. Just using a potion to repair a magic sword was definitely way easier than the arduous process of bringing it to a blacksmith, only to find out that they lacked the required materials, and that’d have to gather them yourself.</p>
<p>「Then. This?」</p>
<p>「Oh? That’s another rare one. It’s called a Potion of Rising Skill, and it’s worth approximately three hundred thousand Golde, however, its price can be inflated up to another ten times as a result of the fact that nobles have an extremely high demand for them. 」</p>
<p>Ten times? Wait, so this thing can be worth up to three million Golde? What the hell, that’s ridiculously expensive! Though, I guess I can kind of see why. Nobles probably buy these for their kids so they can boost up their skill levels without having to risk any sort of danger. I’d actually find it weird for this not to be in high demand.</p>
<p>「Next. Have three of these.」</p>
<p>「Wow… one amazing thing after another is it? This one trumps both your previous items by far.」</p>
<p>It’s even more amazing than a portion that can easily net us over three hundred thousand Golde?</p>
<p>「Do you know what Alchemy potions do?」</p>
<p>「Nope.」</p>
<p>「They’re potions used in alchemy, as suggested by their names. You can mix them in whilst producing an alchemic product in order to elevate the resulting quality and effects. The highest grade ones that you have are so rare that not even I’ve seen them in quite the amount of time. Mixing one into a bunch of ingredients that would normally result in a lesser potion would make so you'd get a high grade potion instead.」</p>
<p>「Then. Means expensive?」</p>
<p>「Very. They cost about a million Golde per piece.」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>Holy crap! They’re both incredibly expensive and effective. If they can turn lesser potions into high grade ones, then what would happen if you mixed them into highest grade potions? Would you end up creating something that could resurrect the dead?</p>
<p>It looked like we made a total of at least three and half million so far. I really wanted to give myself a high five for choosing that box right about now.</p>
<p>『F-Fran, we should show him the rest of what we got.』</p>
<p>「Nn. How about this?」</p>
<p>The next potion Fran brought out was the one I was most curious about, the Anti-Side Effect Potion.</p>
<p>「How interesting. They should be worth about three hundred thousand Golde a piece, but it’s worth nothing that they’re so rare that I’ve never actually seen one in person before.」</p>
<p>「Want to know detailed effects. Especially when used on inorganics. And magic beasts.」</p>
<p>「It should work on magic beasts without any issues whatsoever. I can’t say I’m sure when it comes to inorganics… but it should work.」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. It’s like the Potion of Repair you showed me earlier. They’re both magically enhanced potions, so they should work similarly.」</p>
<p>「Understood. Example. This sword has a powerful special ability. But cannot use for several days after using it. Will using this potion make that time shorter?」</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Hmmm… To be honest, I can’t say for sure whether it’d work like that or not. But it could, theoretically…」</p>
<p>It’s a bit of shame that we can’t actually confirm the potion’s efficacy, but whatever. At least we learned that it <i>could </i>work. We had three, so we could always just use one of them to run a test. Though, said test would result in a net loss of three hundred thousand Golde.</p>
<p>「I have to admit, I’ve been finding this whole thing quite fun. Did you happen to have anything else?」</p>
<p>「This.」</p>
<p>「Hmmm.. It looks like a Potion of Attribute Reversal, and there’s quite the amount of it as well.」</p>
<p>「Nn? Only have one.」</p>
<p>「You don’t normally use more than just a few drops at a time.」</p>
<p>Apparently, the Potion of Attribute Reversal had the ability to do exactly what its name said. It could reverse magical elements, purify poison, and even turn a curse into a blessing. It looked like it’d be fun to play around with.</p>
<p>「You’ve got quite a lot of it. If you used it all at once, you’d probably be able to eliminate a really powerful curse, or maybe even purify a whole pond's worth of poison. It should be worth about one hundred thousand Golde. It’s an amazing potion, but its price isn’t too high because if its limited applications.」</p>
<p>Oh, so it’s cheap because there isn’t any demand for it. Well, technically it’s not really cheap at all, but like, you know, relatively speaking.;</p>
<p>「Hmmm… Would you like to see its effects? We could use a drop of it to perform a bit of an experiment, if you’d like.」</p>
<p>（Master?）</p>
<p>『I don’t really mind if it’s just a drop or two. I’m pretty curious about the experiment he’s got in mind.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Accepted.」</p>
<p>「Alright. Give me just a second.」</p>
<p>Eugene grabbed a glass bottle that seemed to look something like a beaker. It was probably one of the tools he used for alchemy.</p>
<p>「The bottle is only filled with water for now, but I’m going to put a bit of poison inside of it.」</p>
<p>The doctor used a skill and caused a bit of black liquid dripped to drop from his open palm into the beaker.</p>
<p>「Alright, now, you can use this thing right here to verify that the bottle contains poison.」</p>
<p>「Thing?」</p>
<p>「These glasses give you the ability to use appraisal, though its effects are only about the same as that of the skill at level 1.」</p>
<p>Glasses that let you appraise things? That’s pretty neat. I decided to go along with the whole thing and join it with my appraisal as well. Checking the water informed me that it was poisoned, just as the doctor had described it to be.</p>
<p>「Verified.」</p>
<p>「And now, all we have to do is just drip a single drop of the Potion of Attribute Reversal into the bottle.」</p>
<p>「Amazing. Deadly poison water transformed. Water of rejuvenation.」</p>
<p>「Great, ain't it? The poison’s disappeared altogether. You could probably even use this water to make tea.」</p>
<p>「Nn? Can make tea with it?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, and it even makes it more delicious.」</p>
<p>「Delicious?」</p>
<p>「Oh? I guess you must’ve not been aware that the human tongue has the ability to detect magic. That’s why we enjoy eating magic beasts. The same applies to magically enhanced water. Magically enhanced water can totally change the flavour of a cup of tea or a bowl of soup. Would you like to give it a try?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Alright, hold on for a little bit.」</p>
<p>The doctor took about three minutes to prepare Fran another cup of Oobow tea. It didn’t look any different, but apparently looks weren’t everything.</p>
<p>「Tasty!」</p>
<p>「Right?」</p>
<p>Apparently the taste had changed so much that it’d even surprised Fran.</p>
<p>『Is it really that good?』</p>
<p>（Totally different taste. Way yummier.）</p>
<p>The tea now even had the ability to restore one’s stamina and cure minor status conditions. It looked to me like this was something that’d sell pretty well, but the doctor said that it wasn’t a very profitable business because the potion was far too difficult to make in large quantities.</p>
<p>「Possible to make food taste better by pouring in magical energy?」</p>
<p>Ohhh, that’s a good idea.</p>
<p>「Nah. You’d have to use the type of magic most compatible with your ingredients, else the food would actually end up tasting worse. You could pull it off for a single ingredient like water, but, you can’t just pour magical energy into a completed dish to make it taste better.」</p>
<p>「Too bad.」</p>
<p>「You also don’t want there to be too much magic in the food either.」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>「If you eat too much stuff with a lot of magical energy in it, you’re going to end up craving nothing but the taste of magic. All your other tastes will begin to dull.」</p>
<p>Right, makes sense. I do remember there being people that always thought whatever they were eating wasn’t spicy enough. Likewise, there were also people that’d put sugar on literally everything. Magic probably messed up your sense of taste just the same way.</p>
<p>「Why don’t we take demons as an example? They’re born with a lot of magical energy, and hence, they’re fairly sensitive to it. They tend like foods that contain it and since they eat a lot of it throughout their lives, they end up developing a completely different sense of taste than everyone on the more human side of the spectrum. In fact, they don’t even care for any other flavours. All that matters to them is that the food they eat has magic in it. I’ve actually had a demon, an acquaintance of mine, cook for me in the past, and all I can say is that their food tastes like it literally comes from hell.」</p>
<p>Hmm, so that’s how that works. I better be careful not to mess up Fran’s sense of taste. I should probably try to think up a dish that uses a sort of subtle taste as opposed to relying on magical energy.</p>
<p>「Anyways, back on topic. I have to say, I can’t actually use my appraisal skill on the Potion of Attribute Reversal.」</p>
<p>Oh yeah, right, that was a thing. Can’t help but wonder why, now that he’s brought it up and all that.</p>
<p>「It’s because the ingredients are a bit special. One of the chemicals used to create the potion contains appraisal blocking properties. As a result, the final product is also a bit difficult to appraise. Not even I can see anything more than just the item’s name. People with low leveled appraisal skills probably wouldn’t be able to see anything at all, and hence, most people end up labeling bottles like this one just so they don’t get lost. It makes me really wonder where you actually picked it up.」</p>
<p>The last part was nothing more than just a mumble, but regardless, it seemed like he was quite curious as to where we got all these portions.</p>
<p>「Next. This one.」</p>
<p>「A root of arcane soul, and an interesting one at that.」</p>
<p>「Looks empty. Used for what?」</p>
<p>「Don’t mind the invisibility, they’re supposed to be like that. Just think of it as a bottle containing a bunch of magical energy. You can use it to make artificial magic stones.」</p>
<p>「Artificial magic stones?」</p>
<p>「You normally use them when you’re making yourself a familiar. This thing basically ends up becoming the most important part of said familiar’s magic stone. You can use it to adjust the familiar’s skills and properties. I can’t really get anything out of appraising it, so I’d say that it’s most likely potent enough to create a fairly powerful final product.」</p>
<p>「Price?」</p>
<p>「Hmm… Somewhere in the range of fifty thousand to a million.」</p>
<p>That’s a pretty huge price range. Though, I guess it’s fair given how little is known about it. Tts value can probably change depending on who you’re trying to sell it to too. Welp, that one's going to sit in storage for a while.</p>
<p>「Last one.」</p>
<p>The last item we pulled out was the one most likely to cause issues.</p>
<p>「T-That’s… quite the item you’ve got there.」</p>
<p>「Bad to have?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. It’s really dangerous, especially if you’re carrying it around. Make sure you don’t drop it. Okay?」</p>
<p>Eugene’s expression had stayed relatively calm throughout the process, but seeing our last item had caused his face to pale. Apparently the Poison Mixture of the Highest Grade was actually something really hazardous.</p>
<p>「That’s another one I haven’t seen in a long time.」</p>
<p>「Approximate value?」</p>
<p>「Well, you see, that isn’t something you can just put a price on. In fact, selling it might end up getting you in trouble with the law unless you follow a certain set of procedures. That’s just how dangerous it is.」</p>
<p>「That bad?」</p>
<p>「Well… Why don’t I put it this way? You could probably get rid of it by giving it to some sort of military or criminal organisation for about a million Golde. I myself had used it twenty years ago in order to subjugate a dragon classified as a B ranked threat.」</p>
<p>「How effective?」</p>
<p>「A single drop of the stuff is potent enough to kill a hundred grown men, so by that metric, you have enough to wipe out about two thousand people. If you were to use all of it at once, you could probably kill a D ranked magic beast with ease. Even if it didn’t die, it’d probably end up crippled and utterly dysfunctional.」</p>
<p>Wow, that’s uh, pretty bad. I’m not so sure we should actually hold onto it, especially given that Eugene was glaring at it with a rather complicated look on his face.</p>
<p>「I’m not going to force you to agree to this, but, I’d like to take it off your hands. To be completely honest, that poison right there is so deadly that I really don’t want anyone else knowing about it at all. I can pay you up to two hundred thousand Golde.」</p>
<p>「Accepted.」</p>
<p>The bottle sitting in front of us was actually one of many. We’d originally only had a single large bottle of the stuff, but I had Urushi combine his poison magic with my telekinesis in order to divide up the larger bottle’s contents into a bunch of smaller portions. I’d actually even gone and used space/time magic in order to timestop the poison and make the whole process more safe, but, we ultimately ended up rushing it anyway because I could only hold the timestop for a total of five seconds at once. [2]</p>
<p>To be honest, we’d actually only split it up into several smaller bottles because we’d suspected that it’d be confiscated.</p>
<p>「That said, I didn’t actually know that there were any alchemists out there capable of creating this… Where exactly did you happen to get it?」</p>
<p>It’d probably be better for us to tell him than not.</p>
<p>『Fran, show him the box.』</p>
<p>「Nn. This.」</p>
<p>「Isn’t that one of the Alchemist’s Guild’s transport boxes?」</p>
<p>「Found it at pirate’s base. All potions came from inside.」</p>
<p>「That can’t be… I don’t think the Alchemist’s Guild had anyone capable of… Wait…」</p>
<p>He began to start brooding in response the reveal.</p>
<p>「Something wrong?」</p>
<p>「Sorry, it’s just that something seems off.」</p>
<p>「Off?」</p>
<p>「Well, you’re both the person who discovered the box, as well as an adventurer, so I guess there won’t be any harm in telling you. Normally, losing a box like that would cause quite the uproar given the value of the potions and dangerous chemicals within it. Hence, its owner should have contacted the Adventurer’s Guild and issued an order for its immediate retrieval.」</p>
<p>「But no request?」</p>
<p>「Not any that I’ve heard of, at the very least. Keeping silent about the loss of a Poison Mixture of the Highest Grade could even lead to being punished with treason. We also don’t know who these potions were being shipped to, and why. In other words, we’re going to need to get in touch with the Alchemist’s Guild in order to figure out what’s going on.」</p>
<p>That’s fine, but I really don’t want Fran’s name getting out there, especially not for something like this.</p>
<p>「Don’t worry about it. I can swear that I will not disclose your identity.」</p>
<p>Doesn’t look like he’s lying. Well, I guess it can’t be helped then. He’d probably suspect us if we went against him, so let’s just say he owes us and be done with it.</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>「Thank you. Make sure you stop by again. I’ll be around most of the time, and I’ll make sure to serve you another cup of tea if you do drop by.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Well, I was interested in alchemy anyway, so yeah, why not?</p>

<p>We headed back over to the inn after finishing up our business at the Adventurer’s Guild.</p>
<p>I wanted to straight up just go out, find a kitchen, and buy everything we needed, but we couldn't actually get to that right away. There was still something else we needed to do first.</p>
<p><span id="more-297"></span></p>
<p>『We’re going to need to decide what we’re going to be selling.』</p>
<p>「Curry.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『Well, yeah, but we still have to think about our ingredients and figure out how spicy we’re going to make it. We also have to determine how we’re going to serve our customers and get all that ready too.』</p>
<p>Barbra was a pretty big town, and there were lots of stalls and stuff for food all over the place, so it probably wouldn’t be all that hard for us to get in touch with someone willing to sign a wholesale contract for all our miscellaneous needs. Both paper plates and wooden spoons could be mass produced through the use of alchemy, and apparently the Chef’s Guild had a few contacts of their own, so we could actually just get everything done through them if we wanted. They’d probably give us a pretty good price point too.</p>
<p>We already had all the spices we needed on hand thanks to our pirate “friends,” so that was something we could cross off right away.</p>
<p>All in all, we had forty different types of spices at our disposal, so I set each out on a plate and lined them all up in front of me. We had such a large variety that I actually had to liberty choose to make it as mild or spicy as I wanted.</p>
<p>「Mild is better choice. Spicy is tasty but hard to eat.」</p>
<p>『Hm, you did always like the milder ones more. Besides, a milder curry is a lot less risky than something on the spicier side seeing as how children will probably end up being a pretty big portion of our sales.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Whimper.」</p>
<p>『Oh yeah, you did like the spicier ones, didn’t you Urushi?』</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>『Hmmm, well, I do think that a fair portion of our older customers will probably prefer a bit more spice in it as well.』</p>
<p>I mean, we could always just do both. Either way, we probably need to put a bit more thought into the ingredients first…</p>
<p>『What kind of curry do you think I should make? We could probably use beef-like meat, pork-like meat, lizard-like meat, fish-like meat or chicken-like meat. Bug-like meat, tiger-like meat, and wolf-like meat could probably work as well.』</p>
<p>The reason I stuck a “-like” after all the potential ingredient types was because we weren’t actually going to use regular farm animals. We were planning to use meat procured from magic beasts instead. For example, we’d be using Crash Boars instead of pigs if we went with pork, and Rock Bison instead of cows if we went with beef.</p>
<p>「Hmm… Pork.」</p>
<p>『Alright, that’s one thing we could do.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『You liked bird meat, right Urushi?』</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>『Alright, pork and chicken are going to be our two main choices then.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>People from the Kansai region seemed to like beef-based curries. I, however, was from the Kantou region, and thus, I myself was much more inclined towards pork. Fran liked pork as too, and she’d always ask for it to be used in curry. Hence, I ending up using most of the cow-like creatures for stuff like hamburgers and barbeques instead. [1]</p>
<p>If we wanted meat, we’d probably have to find ourselves a butcher. I remember seeing a decent number of them in the marketplace. Said marketplace was really big, so we didn’t actually get to check out all the shops yet, but I was pretty sure that at least a few specialized in butchering magic beasts.</p>
<p>『Did you want to put anything else in? We're going to use potatoes, carrots and onions for sure. Curry wouldn’t really be curry without them. That said, we could probably try enhancing the flavour by adding a few secret ingredients too. You know, stuff like apples, or honey, or maybe even chocolate…』</p>
<p>Fran was the type that didn’t really like chunks in her curry. She very much preferred when the vegetables were cooked to the point where they kind of just ended up melting into the mixture, hence the choices listed.</p>
<p>「What about toppings?」</p>
<p>『Won’t those be a bit too hard to manage? We only have one stall's worth of space』</p>
<p>「Breaded cutlets. Cheeseburgers. Kara-age. Hot spring eggs. Deep fried vegetables. All tasty.」</p>
<p>Yeah, that’s way too many. At most, we could have like one or two…</p>
<p>『Why don’t we go check out the market place? We can think about what toppings we’ll have after we finish getting all the materials we need. Let’s try focusing on procuring the best pork-like meat and vegetables we can get for now.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We browsed Barbra’s massive portside marketplace for about an hour. All sorts of goods were on display, and most could even be found in wholesale tier quantities, but despite that, we weren’t able to get our hands on what we needed.</p>
<p>『It doesn’t look like any of the butchers really have all that much magic beast meat in stock.』</p>
<p>Pork-type magic beast meat was not only especially rare, but also extremely expensive. Maybe it’d be better for us to give up and just use regular pork instead.</p>
<p>I mean, we were already in a pretty good spot anyways. Curry wasn’t exactly something that the people of this world would be able to get their hands on with ease, so we could probably pull a win with just the rarity factor.</p>
<p>On the bright side, we did manage to catch sight of all the vegetable-type stuff we needed. Apples, honey, chocolate, and coffee all looked like they were in pretty high abundance as well. I wouldn’t have any problems giving the curry a bit of an extra kick, so in all honesty, we didn’t need to use meat procured from magic beasts.</p>
<p>「Nom nom.」</p>
<p>「Om bark nom bark」</p>
<p>『You guys sure seem to be enjoying yourselves.』</p>
<p>「Doing market research. Need to determine popular tastes.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof.」</p>
<p>『Well, that’s fine, I guess.』</p>
<p>They were being relatively quiet, so it was pretty easy for me to listen in on people trying to make deals, which in turn helped me gather information on suppliers and market prices.</p>
<p>『Wait, did you just say market research? That’s actually a pretty good idea. We should go check out the competition.』</p>
<p>「Check out competition?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, let’s go find all the people who did well last year and try a bit of their cooking.』</p>
<p>Pretty much everyone that qualified last year was now super famous, so we might just be able to eat some of their dishes if we headed over to their workplaces.</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi was happily wagging his tail, but I felt like there was a pretty good chance that he wasn’t going to be allowed in any of the stores. I hope he doesn’t get too disappointed.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>It was actually surprisingly easy for us to gather all the information we needed. Many of Barbra’s roadside stalls were run by old men that caved almost instantly at the sight of a beautiful young woman buying their goods on en masse. They pretty much divulged everything they knew without so much as a second thought.</p>
<p>「Here?」</p>
<p>『The sign says “The Dragon’s Table,” so yeah, should be the right place.』</p>
<p>After gathering a bit of information, we arrived at the conclusion that this was the closest place. Moveover, the owner was actually one of last year’s finalists.</p>
<p>I had expected the place to be super high class, but its exterior wasn’t nearly as fancy as I'd imagined. The prices on the menu sitting out front weren’t really high either, so I couldn’t help but suspect that we’d come to the wrong place.</p>
<p>「Store open?」</p>
<p>We pushed the door open and looked inside. The restaurant itself had a calm, relaxing atmosphere.</p>
<p>「Welcome. Table for one?」</p>
<p>「Nn. One person. One pet.」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry, but this restaurant doesn’t allow pets.」</p>
<p>「But Urushi..」</p>
<p>「Whimper whimper.」</p>
<p>『Well, rules are rules. You’re going to have to stay in Fran’s shadow for a bit.』</p>
<p>「Whimper…」</p>
<p>I’ll treat him to something nice later to make up for it.</p>
<p>「Then just one person.」</p>
<p>「D-Did your dog just sink into your shadow…?」</p>
<p>「Must be mistaken.」</p>
<p>「Huh? Really? W-Well, there’s no way a dog can just sink into a shadow, so you’re probably right. I must be getting tired.」</p>
<p>Sorry waitress lady… Seems like this is really hard on you.</p>
<p>「Recommendations?」</p>
<p>「Hmm… What about the Dragon Bone Soup? It’s one of our signatures, and if you look outside you’ll see it on the menu.」</p>
<p>「Dragon bone? Bones from dragons used in soup stock?」</p>
<p>「Yup, it’s really good.」</p>
<p>Dragon bone soup eh? I can’t even imagine how that’s supposed to taste.</p>
<p>「Then that. And this, this, this and this.」</p>
<p>「Our servings are a bit big. Are you sure you’d like to order all that?」</p>
<p>「Yes.」</p>
<p>「Okay, then I’ll just repeat your order so I can have you verify it. It’ll be one Dragon Bone Soup, one Rockbird Steak, one Gold Sheep Skewer, one Yggd Potato Salad, and one Barbra Crab Pilaf, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>It looked like a lot of food, but to Fran, it really wasn’t all that much at all.</p>
<p>The first dish to arrive, the Dragon Bone Soup, came after about ten minutes worth of waiting. The bowl didn’t actually contain any traces of the ingredients used to create the final product. The only thing it had inside of it was a golden, translucent, consomme-like soup.</p>
<p>I sneakily stored about half of the Dragon Bone Soup away for research purposes as soon as the waitress stopped paying attention.</p>
<p>（Can eat now?）</p>
<p>『Yeah, go ahead.』</p>
<p>「Eating then.」</p>
<p>Slurp slurp.</p>
<p>Fran raised the bowl and drank a mouthful of its contents.</p>
<p>『How is it?』</p>
<p>「…Yummy.」</p>
<p>Her face seemed a bit pained, and far from content. Was it actually really bad or something?</p>
<p>「Might be even better than Master’s consomme soup.」</p>
<p>『I see.』</p>
<p>It’s gotta be pretty amazing then. That’s probably the highest possible praise one could possibly get from Fran as far as food goes.</p>
<p>Much to my surprise, the soup was priced pretty cheaply. All of the store’s other dishes that used magic beasts cost around 50 Golde a plate, but the soup only cost 20.</p>
<p>It looked like I’d been underestimating the competition far too much. I probably won’t be able to win if I just half ass everything.</p>
<p>Sampling the soup with a doppelganger after we got back to the inn only convinced me of my prior observation all the more.</p>
<p>We later went back over to the market and checked out a few more of the stores related to last year's participants and came to the conclusion that all of them had pretty damned good food. My Doppelganger’s senses were relatively fine tuned as a result of the superiorization process, so I had about the same sense of taste as the average human being. Hence, I was able to come to an understanding of exactly how skilled our competitors were.</p>
<p>『It looks like we might actually end up dead last if I don’t try my best.』</p>
<p>Okay, yeah. Regular pork is definitely out of the question. I'm going to have to find myself some sort of magic beast meat. I've got to be careful in choosing the rest of my materials as well. Freshness and taste are important, but we can’t go over budget else we won’t profit enough. I’m going to use as many spices as necessary without holding back though.</p>
<p>I have to figure out exactly how we’re going to sell everything too. I mean, how are you actually supposed to sell curry using a stall? People might think that they’re not actually getting enough bang for their buck if all we give them is a plate with some rice and curry on it.</p>
<p>Alright, the only way for us to really do this will be to use every connection we’ve got.</p>
<p>『We should probably pay the Luciel Conglomerate a visit. They were supposed to be a pretty big company, so they might have the meat and vegetables we need in stock.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>Let’s see, is there anything else we’re missing? We’ve got the spices. The meat and vegetables hopefully won’t be an issue, so all that’s left would be… water. I want to use decently high quality water. I mean, the wells aren’t here aren’t bad or anything, it seemed that well water wasn’t the only type of water that could potentially be available to us.</p>
<p>We should probably ask the people at the conglomerate about that as well. We do have money, so we could probably make up for a decent amount of our lack of experience and skill by using high quality materials. I kinda ended up attacking this whole thing with a bit of a nouveau riche type approach, but hey, whatever it takes for victory is whatever I’ll do.</p>
<p>『Let’s make sure we get our hands on some good materials!』</p>
<p>「Yeah.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>[1] Bit of info for anyone that's clueless when it comes to Japanese geography. Kansai is like south-western Japan. Kantou is the eastern part. For reference, Tokyo (which is actually pronounced Toukyou by the way!) is a part of the Kantou region. It's kind of like comparing Cali with NY.</p>
<p>Woot, made my estimated release with 10 minutes to spare.</p>
					
    < /br>

        
		<p><strong>106. The Luciel Conglomerate</strong></p>
<p>「Hey, welcome. Glad to see you chose to stop by.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Hahaha, welcome to you too Urushi.」</p>
<p><span id="more-304"></span></p>
<p>We were currently inside the Luciel Conglomerate’s HQ. The building was about the same size as the Adventurer’s Guild, only several times more extravagant. Putting it next to Fran made her look really out of place, but she boldly walked right in regardless. Man, she’s got guts.</p>
<p>The coin we got from the captain was seriously one hell of an item. Flashing it caused the people at the reception desk to show us over to a fancy-looking waiting room without so much as a question.</p>
<p>Rengil showed up in said room not long after we were taken to it. We'd only just parted that morning, but he happily greeted Fran with a smile and handshake regardless. He seemed genuinely excited to see us.</p>
<p>「So did you have any sort of business here, or were you just visiting?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Participating in this.」</p>
<p>「Oh, you’re participating in the King of Cooking? Did you already pass the first round?」</p>
<p>He figured out what she was talking about with nothing more than a single glance at the flyer she handed him. The contest was pretty famous, so it only made sense that the captain knew about it.</p>
<p>「Master passed.」</p>
<p>「You had a Master? I don’t think there was anyone like that aboard the ship, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Master is elusive. Like a phantom.」</p>
<p>「I see, so did the two of you meet up here then?」</p>
<p>We’d come up with a bit of an odd scenario. Fran’s story would be that I, her master, was the type of man that wandered the continent and appeared where and whenever he so pleased. It probably doesn’t really give them the best impression of me, but whatever, can’t be helped.</p>
<p>「Want to get ingredients for Master. For cooking contest.」</p>
<p>「Ah, gotcha, so that’s why you’re here. What kind of dish is he planning to make? The competition’s been pretty fierce every year, so it’s gotta be something really good.」</p>
<p>「Curry.」</p>
<p>「Curry? Never heard of anything called curry before.」</p>
<p>「Master’s own recipe. Here.」</p>
<p>Fran took a plate of curry out from her dimensional storage and placed it atop a table in front of Rengil.</p>
<p>The captain looked at the dish with a bit of a hesitant gaze. Well, I guess that was fair. It was brown, and didn’t really look all that appetizing if you didn't know what it was. He probably couldn’t really even guess at how it tasted. But that all soon changed, his eyes opened wide the moment he caught a whiff of the dish’s scent. He seemed to come to the realization that it was flavoured with all sorts of spices, which further lead him to swallow a gulp of what must've been drool.</p>
<p>「Alright, down the hatch it goes.」</p>
<p>The first bite he took was still a rather cautious and careful one, but the dish's contents almost vanished instantly immediately afterwards he finished it. His spoon continued to move until the plate we handed him was wiped clean. Seeing him enjoy its flavour like that left me feeling quite content.</p>
<p>「It’s delicious, fragrant, and even something completely original. I guarantee you that it’ll definitely fly right off the shelves. That’s one valuable recipe you've got right there!」</p>
<p>Rengil was so excited that he ended up raising his voice in a shout. Sweet, it looks like we’ve even got an experienced merchant's approval.</p>
<p>「Is this what he was planning to sell at his stall?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I see…」</p>
<p>「Something wrong?」</p>
<p>「Bark?」</p>
<p>「Well, the dish itself is really quite delicious, but it might not do all that well at a stall.」</p>
<p>「Why? Curry is tasty.」</p>
<p>「It’s not exactly what I’d call customer accessible.」</p>
<p>Most that’d qualified for the finals in the past had sold skewers or soup, stuff that was relatively easy for customers to grab immediately after making their orders. The goal was to profit, so you had to make sure you sold as much as possible in the given time frame.</p>
<p>Curry was unlike the examples listed in the sense that it wasn’t something that customers could just pick up and walk away with. We would have to serve each plate by placing a bunch of rice on it, pouring curry all over said rice, and then finally handing it over to the customer. To make matters worse, the whole plate format made it so that customers couldn’t actually buy our products en masse. At most, the average consumer could hold only a single plate in each hand.</p>
<p>What if we ignored the whole rice thing and made it kind of like curry soup? Hmm… nah, I doubt it’d be able to trump the Dragon Bone Soup.</p>
<p>Coming to the realisation that we needed a change of plans caused Fran to groan.</p>
<p>「Need easy way to sell curry in bulk…?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. You can’t rely on taste alone if you want to get through the second round.」</p>
<p>Okay yeah, this isn’t going to work if we stick to the whole curry with rice idea…</p>
<p>「Oh! Got good idea. Can just turn inside out.」</p>
<p>「Inside out?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Put curry inside rice. Like onigiri.」[1]</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Onigiri was one of Fran’s favourite dishes. She pretty much loved to eat the rice balls regardless of what they were filled with, so she must’ve figured that it’d work pretty well with curry. Urushi seemed all gung ho about the idea as well; he immediately started to drool at Fran's mention of the combined dish.</p>
<p>Curry flavoured onigiri, is it? I mean, it does sound like a good idea, but the curry would probably eventually start to leak out the bottom of its ricey container, so it wouldn’t really be convenient as far as customers were concerned. I could just pack the rice super tight to prevent any leakage, but that’d probably make it taste a lot worse.</p>
<p>（Can’t fry it like tempura?）</p>
<p>『Hmm, curry onigiri tempura?』</p>
<p>You know, that might actually end up working. Its name is totally not something you’d put on any sort of A-list, but the tastes might mesh together pretty decently. That said, I’d a better idea. Fran’s words had reminded me of a dish I’d coincidentally forgotten until just now.</p>
<p>『Hmm, that’s a pretty good idea.』</p>
<p>（Nn? Tempura onigiri?）</p>
<p>『No, no, not that.』</p>
<p>I knew of a dish that fulfilled all our needs. It was fairly cheap, easy to carry, and it could even be sold in bulk. It was especially delicious fresh out of the oven, but pretty much just as good even after cooling down.</p>
<p>『Let’s go with curry bread.』 [2]</p>
<p>（Curry bread!）</p>
<p>（Woof woof!）</p>
<p>Neither Fran nor Urushi had ever had it before, but its name contained the word curry, so both their eyes seemed to light up immediately in response.</p>
<p>If we went down the curry bread route, we’d be able to mass produce our products ahead of time. We could even make several different kinds, each with its own unique flavour.</p>
<p>Hearing me elaborate on the idea caused Fran’s eyes to shine with even greater intensity.</p>
<p>「Will work. Curry bread.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Curry bread? What’s that?」</p>
<p>「Put curry in dough and fry.」</p>
<p>「I see, I see. That sounds like it could work. The dish’s fragrance would help you draw in customers, and they could pretty much order as many as they wanted.」</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Can have different flavours.」</p>
<p>「Oh, that’s a pretty strong pro too.」</p>
<p>Alright! I finally know what to do! Curry bread ahoy!</p>
<p>That said, our plans were still riddled with problems.</p>
<p>「Need flour. Can get from here?」</p>
<p>「Hmm… Are you okay with the type normally used for bread?」</p>
<p>（Master?）</p>
<p>『Shouldn’t be a problem.』</p>
<p>「No problem.」</p>
<p>「Alright.」</p>
<p>Apparently they had a tonne of flour in stock, so we could more or less get as much as we wanted.</p>
<p>「I’ll put in an urgent order for the flour so we can get it ready as soon as possible.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Thanks.」</p>
<p>I’m still a bit worried about the rest of our stuff though</p>
<p>「Need lots of other ingredients too. Can also get from here?」</p>
<p>「That’ll depend on exactly what it is you’re looking for. I know for a fact that we’ve got some pretty solid stocks on the vegetable side at least.」</p>
<p>「Want carrots, potatoes, onions for vegetables. Some apple too.」</p>
<p>「Alright, we weren’t going to be able to get you any magic vegetables or the like, but that, we can do, especially since all the items you asked for can be stored away from quite some time. Do keep in mind that none of them will be just recently harvested though.」</p>
<p>Oh well, I guess it can’t be helped. I’m actually pretty happy already seeing as how we managed to actually secure ourselves a reliable supplier. That said, the rest of our ingredients would probably need a bit extra oomph to make up for it.</p>
<p>「Any magic beast meat in stock?」</p>
<p>「We might’ve been able to get you some with a bit more time, but…」</p>
<p>Can’t say I didn’t see that coming. Not even the butchers could get their hands on any decent quantities of the stuff. Damn it, what now? We finally managed to solidify our concept and all that, but we’re lacking the most important part we need to actualize it.</p>
<p>「Then water?」</p>
<p>「Water? What about it?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Magic infused water. With effects like healing.」</p>
<p>「That’s a bit too far of a stretch too. Water’s really tough to transport, so I can’t say we’ve a lot of it in stock.」</p>
<p>Arggghh, that’s another option crossed right off… Wait, no, we could probably actually just make the water we needed ourselves. I have a whole swamp full of poisoned water sitting around in the dimensional storage. I could probably just use the Potion of Attribute Reversal on it and well, voila, water get.</p>
<p>In other words, we just need to focus on getting our hands on some high quality meat. Hmmm… Actually, I do have an idea that could potentially solve all our problems. You see, the thing is, we weren’t just everyday run of the mill chefs. We were adventurers. If we couldn’t buy something off the marketplace, then we could simply just go get it ourselves. There were still a few days till things got up and running, so we had more than enough time. All we needed was figure out where to find the prey we were after.</p>
<p>「Don’t worry about magically infused water then. Would rather move to next topic. Want to know where to find magic beasts.」</p>
<p>「Are you planning to go hunting for all the meat you need?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I think I’ve actually got the perfect place in mind for that.」</p>
<p>Rengil told us a bit about a haunt to Barbra’s south. Its name was the Cage of Crystal, and its rank was B. [3]</p>
<p>That was where Barbra got most of its magic beast meat. The haunt was inhabited by a lot of D ranked magic beasts, so it was actually apparently thought of as a pretty dangerous place. It wasn’t really that far, so the captain figured that we shouldn’t have any issues at all.</p>
<p>「I'd warn you to be extra careful, but I feel like you of all people will probably be just fine. You’ve got Urushi with you too, after all.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Will be fine.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Make sure you sell any extra meat to us though, alright?」</p>
<p>Man, he’s shrewd. That said, we do owe him. He didn’t charge us any fees for the information he gave us, and he’s even offering to pay as opposed as opposed to just asking for free stuff. He’s a pretty good guy, and he really has done us a favour. Yeah, we’re probably going to be seeing each other a lot more going forward.</p>
<p>And that was that. It was a bit late, so we decided to head back for the time being so we could gather information and make the water we needed and whatnot. Apparently, it’d normally take about two days to reach the haunt on horseback, so it’d probably make for a bit more than just a day trip, even for us. We were going to have to leave pretty early tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>『It’ll probably be a bit tough to pull everything off within the time limit, but I’ll be counting on you guys. Let’s do this!』</p>
<p>「Nn. Will work hard for curry bread’s sake.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>I swear they’re driven by nothing but apetite… Oh well, whatever. Our next steps were to find out a bit more about the haunt, have dinner, and then think a bit more about exactly what we’re going to do about the whole curry bread situation.</p>

<p>[1] Rice balls, typically filled with some sort of tasty, preserved food. They're a huuuuge trend in Japan and you can pretty find like ten different types at any given convenience store, country wide. You can even find stores that literally only sell onigiri and nothing else. It's kind of like the Japanese equivalent of sandwiches. It's especially popular in the Kantou area, and I remember there being like three different chain stores last time I went. Image below.</p>

<p>[2] Bit different from a sandwich. He thinks of this when Fran says tempura curry onigiri because the two are rather similar. One is a deep fried ball of rice with curry inside of it. The other is a deep fried hunk of dough with curry inside of it. Here's an image of curry bread.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don't really like it myself. My taste palette isn't exactly Japanese though, so meh.</p>
<p>[3] Haunts are different from dungeons, but it's more or less the same kind of thing given how broad the definition of dungeons in games has become. It's quite literally translated at the moment, and I don't really like it. Most of the MMOs I've played recently have only had instance dungeons and raids, nothing named in any which way in particular. Someone help me think of a better name. Really gamey terms are ideal. (I can't believe I can't think of a term for this even though I'm literally doing a masters of game design…)</p>

		<p><b>107. The Cage of the Crystal Tree<br>
</b><br>
The date was March 31st; the Lunar Banquet was less than a day away.</p>
<p><span id="more-312"></span></p>
<p>We left for the haunt at sunrise. Luckily, our journey over its entrance proceeded rather smoothly, we didn't encounter any sort of trouble during our travels. The city was going to swing into full on festival mode when night hit, so I wanted to finish up all our business and get back as soon as possible. A few basic calculations determined that we should be able to make it back before the festival began, as it only took us three hours to fly on over to the haunt.</p>
<p>「Gya gya gya!」</p>
<p>「Grooooorororororo!」</p>
<p>The haunt could only be described as a deep, dark forest, filled with immense, high standing trees. Its interior contained magic beasts of all shapes and sizes. We could feel their presence and hear the noises they made even from the forest’s entrance.</p>
<p>『So this is the so called B ranked haunt, The Cage of Crystals Tree, huh? 』</p>
<p>「Can sense many magic beasts.」</p>
<p>「Ruff.」</p>
<p>『Alright, I’m going to go over our plans one more time, just in case. We’re going to try and gun for the center-ish area and hunt for edible magic beasts.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Hunting for meat.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof.」</p>
<p>Not all magic beasts were entirely edible, even if their bodies were filled to the brim with magical energy. We really didn’t have all that much time on our hands, so it was in our best interest to only go after stuff we could actually use. Luckily, the research we did at the Adventurer’s Guild saved us quite a bit of trouble. There, we learned that most edible magic beasts were found somewhere around the forest’s center area.</p>
<p>We immediately took the fastest route over. That is, Urushi carried Fran on his back whilst leaping through the air; it was far more efficient to navigate the overly dense woodland from above.</p>
<p>I wanted to try hunting a bit around the entrance as well, but we really didn’t have the time for it, so I reluctantly refrained.</p>
<p>「Crystal Tree over there?」</p>
<p>『Yeah. Apparently it’s well over three thousand years old.』</p>
<p>The Crystal Tree was one of many magical plants that had the ability to emit a sort magical energy that drew in all sorts of herbivorous magic beasts. The plant’s potency would scale with its size, and hence, it would draw in more and more powerful magic beasts as it grew. The tree’s leaves were considered by magic beasts to be a sort of delicacy, and thus, they would fight for the right to the territory in its immediate vicinity. It was of such value to them that they’d even protect it from harm.</p>
<p>The herbivorous magic beasts that took residence around the tree would then function to draw in carnivorous ones. This process would ultimately continue to repeat itself over and over, and thus, all sorts of magic beasts ended up making its surroundings into their habitats. It could be said that this whole haunt was only here because The Crystal Tree had sprouted here, especially seeing as how The Crystal Tree located was classified as both the world’s oldest and largest magic tree.</p>
<p>Riding on Urushi’s back as he traversed a path atop the tree of seas allowed us to observe The Crystal Tree in all its majesty.</p>
<p>It really did live up to its reputation. The tree’s height surpassed three hundred meters, and its leaves shone with a brilliance that made them seem as if they really were made out of crystal.</p>
<p>And so, I burned it in my eyes.</p>
<p>A sight that would have outright been impossible in the world from which I came.</p>
<p>Creatures that resembled birds flew around the tree’s branches. They looked but like fledglings in comparison to the plant’s grand stature, but in reality, each had a wingspan of at least three meters. I didn’t particularly wish to deal with them, they looked like a huge pain in the ass to fight.</p>
<p>『Be careful. We might start running into B leveled threats if we end up getting too close to the tree.』</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>『Anyway, we should be somewhere around the center area now. Let’s find ourselves some magic beasts and descend.』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>『It's finally time to go hunting.』</p>
<p>「Meat time.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>Twenty minutes passed.</p>
<p>『Oryaaaaaaa!』</p>
<p>「Squeeeeallll!」</p>
<p>「Urushi. Over there.」</p>
<p>「Growl!」</p>
<p>We found a group of five Swamp Pigs and took them down. In short, they could be described as pigs with shells that basically lived in the mud.</p>
<p>I wasn't really satisfied. We did actually end up hunting them down and all that, but honestly, it was far less a hit than it was a miss.</p>
<p>I mean, they were pig-type magic beasts, and they did taste pretty good. In fact, one could say that they really were quite delicious. However, they weren’t good enough. They carried with them an ever so slight stench of mud and filth even when cooked, and as a result, they actually didn’t even taste as good as well fed, brand name, non-magic pork. The only adventurers that really bothered hunting them were newbies in need of some quick cash. That said, they were kind of amazing in their own way if you thought about it. They weren’t well raised, nor selectively bred, yet, they still almost managed to taste as good as genuine branded pork.</p>
<p>Oh well, I guess we can treat them as insurance just in case we don’t manage to find ourselves anything better.</p>
<p>『Alright Urushi, it’ll be up to you to find some more magic beasts.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Go deeper?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, that’s not a bad suggestion. Let’s try getting a bit closer to The Crystal Tree. We might not actually be in the center area yet.』</p>
<p>Swamp Pigs were supposed to be from the outermost layer anyways, so yeah.</p>
<p>An hour passed.</p>
<p>I could only conclude that hunting for a specific monster was none other than a huge pain in the ass. We'd only just managed to find a single wild boar. We kept running into all sorts of unedible magic beasts instead of actually coming across what we wanted.</p>
<p>「This magic beast. What captain was talking about?」<br>
『Yup. It’s a Golden Boar, and it looks exactly as he described it to be.』</p>

Conviction</p>
<p>Description: A magic beast that resembles a wild boar. Its golden fur is extremely tough and can even has the ability to repel some degree of magic. Its tusks are powerful enough for it to crush large trees, and it has been observed taking down assailants twice its size. It knows not of the concept of retreat, and will continue to rush down its enemies with Charge regardless of the situation. Thus, it is nicknamed the Boar of Insanity. Threat level D. Its magic stone is located within its heart.<br>
_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>I’m pretty happy we finally managed to run into something we could turn into meat. Better yet was the fact that it was rather large. Its height was over five meters, and I’d say that its mass was probably at least twice Urushi’s.</p>
<p>『We’re after its meat, so try not to rough it up too much if you can help it.』</p>
<p>「I know.」</p>
<p>『Urushi, you focus on distracting it and restricting its movements.』</p>
<p>「Growl growl!」</p>
<p>It’ll probably end up bleeding a lot if we give it too many injuries, which in turn would lead to a reduction in its flavour. Hitting it in the wrong place will also end up reducing the amount of edible meat we can harvest from it.</p>
<p>The most ideal situation would be taking it out by destroying its magic stone in one blow.</p>
<p>That said, I can’t actually use my telekinetic catapult to get at it. I mean, I <i>could. </i>I would end up being able to take it out with ease, but I’d probably also end up pulverizing a good chunk of what would otherwise be edible flesh.</p>
<p>「Oinnnnkkkkk!」</p>
<p>『Tsk! Dodge it, Fran!』</p>
<p>The golden boar began charging at us as I contemplated our strategies.</p>
<p>It was much faster than I expected.</p>
<p>I tried slowing it down with Telekinesis, but it was charging with such force that it basically had no effect at all.</p>
<p>「Ugh!」</p>
<p>『You alright?』</p>
<p>「Some. how.」</p>
<p>Fran managed to avoid a direct hit; the boar had only scraped her. But despite that, she ended up flying a whole ten meters. In other words, the boat was incredibly powerful. A single one of its strikes had managed to destroy several trees, each large enough to have been classified as sacred in Japan. [1]</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>Yeah no. We're going to have to put in a bit more than just a bit of effort.</p>
<p>Fran immediately used her Sky Jump to leap into the air and whilst brandishing me with a resolute look on her face.</p>
<p>『I’m going to use magic and dig up a pitfall. Urushi, try luring the boar over to it. We should be able to get ourselves a good window of a few seconds if it falls inside. Fran, make sure you take advantage of any openings so you can finish it off in one go.』</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>「Oiiiiinkkkk!!」</p>
<p>I did exactly as described and created a bunch of large holes in the ground. Urushi also managed to perform pretty well. He stood in front of the boar and taunted it by moving around in an overly provocative manner. That is he shrank and then jumped up and down in order to annoy the boar as much as possible.</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>And surely enough, he succeeded. The boar was irked by the now tiny wolf’s mannerisms and began charging at it in a straight line as if to crush it.</p>
<p>The boar's charge contained all the force of an eighteen wheel truck, and again destroyed every tree that happened to be in its path. This time, however, its ability and lack of a will to retreat ended up doing it more harm than good.</p>
<p>「Oink?!」</p>
<p>『It fell for it! Fran, you turn!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran leapt through the air as she approached the pitfall the pig had fallen into whilst thrusting me towards its heart. I quickly followed up and thinned my shape in order to accommodate her actions.</p>
<p>「Haaah!」</p>
<p>「Squeeeaaaaalllll!」</p>
<p>Fran suddenly switched over to using a reverse grip and activated Pinpoint Stab, a level eight sword technique. She thrusted me straight through the boar’s spine and pierced its magic stone whilst destroying as little of its flesh as possible, a textbook worthy killing blow.</p>
<p>I stored the golden boar away for the time being. We wanted to dismantle it immediately, but this wasn’t the place for that. Disassembling the boar’s body in the middle of a haunt would likely attract more magic beasts. We’ll probably have to just borrow the Adventurer’s Guild’s facilities later.</p>
<p>Either way, we’d managed to get all the pork substitute we needed. The boar literally had an entire tonne of useable meat on it, so we were well within the safe zone.</p>
<p>『Alright, that’s one down, just a few more to go!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>We hunted for another two or so hours and found ourselves a pair of cow-like magic beasts and five chicken-like ones. Their species names were Apis and Gullinkambi respectively. The Gullinkambis we happened across were actually guarding a nest, so we managed to pick up eight of their eggs as a bit of an extra bonus. I really had to say, we scored pretty big despite only going out on a relatively short hunt.</p>
<p>The magic beasts we happened across had actually all been decently strong. I mean, they were weaker than the kind of stuff you’d see in a dungeon, but they popped up way more often. Luckily, we didn’t have to stay overnight as a result of the super high encounter rates, so we quickly began to head back in Barbra’s direction the moment we achieved our objectives.</p>
<p>That said, I couldn’t help but feel as if something was a bit off, it still seemed that the forest itself had been thrown into a state of restlessness. At first, I’d thought that the unnatural sensation stemmed from the fact that I was new to the place and didn’t know much about it, Urushi and Fran felt the same as well, which was weird. None of us were able to really calm down.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for us to come to understand the reason behind the odd sensation we felt.</p>
<p>A thundering roar suddenly exploded from within the forest and assaulted our eardrums.</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>『Woah! What’s with this sudden influx of magical energy?』</p>
<p>「Growl…」</p>
<p>The loud roaring was accompanied by an immense wave of magical energy.</p>
<p>「Master. Over there.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, I see it.』</p>
<p>I noticed a massive bird-like thing flying around The Crystal Tree. It was a bit too far for me to appraise, but I immediately recognized it, partially because of the way it would shoot off waves of light from time to time.</p>
<p>『Looks like a Thunderbird and two Storm Eagles.』</p>
<p>Thunderbirds were B level threats, and Storm Eagles D level threats. The Adventurer’s Guild had informed us that the former was one of the area’s most dangerous magic beasts, and that we should be cautious of it in any given situation.</p>
<p>The Thunderbird’s rank was the same as the demon we defeated back when we were still in Alessa, but I honestly couldn’t say for sure if we could actually beat it in a fight. Unlike the demon, it wasn’t being held back in any which way. Moreover, it even had a pair of subordinates with it. We wouldn’t be able to get out unscathed even if we did win.</p>
<p>That said, the sudden intense magical influx we felt wasn’t something that originated from the Thunderbird.</p>
<p>「Person there. About to fight?」</p>
<p>I could vaguely make out the shape of person floating around the Thunderbird. Said person had so much magical energy that we could feel it from where we were now.</p>
<p>It didn’t look like he had any companions; he was fighting alone. I almost wanted to call him out for being reckless, but for some odd reason, I couldn’t help but feel as if he’d win. It seemed that he was why we had felt so unsettled; crisis detection and presence detection had been picking up his trail.</p>
<p>「Started moving.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>The Thunderbird had started to shoot lighting from its beak, but, the person dodged the sky-illuminating electric strikes with ease.</p>
<p>It seemed that the Thunderbird had only been scoping his abilities out at first, as it immediately charged at him with a motion several times faster than what it’d been displaying thus far. It was easy for us to tell what it was doing since we were observing from a relatively safe distance, but the person in battle likely didn’t have nearly as good a grasp on its actions due to the chaotic nature of combat. That said, the person was still able to dodge every attack aimed at him with ease. What terrifying reflexes.</p>
<p>The three birds flew back into formation whilst backing off, as if to regroup.</p>
<p>Only an ever so slight opening had been created by the action, but the person had managed to take advantage of it regardless. And thus, he began to counterattack.</p>
<p>And through said counter, he ended the battle in a single blow.</p>
<p>「Swords. Lots.」</p>
<p>『Hmm.. is that magic? No, it looks more like a skill…』</p>
<p>An incredible swords instantly appeared around the person as he raised an arm. I couldn’t tell if he summoned them or created them. He might’ve done something else altogether. Either way, I had no idea what he did. What I did know, however, was that every single one of the swords he summoned was at least as powerful as the average magic sword. Every single one was brimming with mana.</p>
<p>Every single one of his blades immediately accelerated towards the birds at high speed. They didn’t move nearly as quickly as I did with my telekinetic catapult, but they more than made up for it with numbers; there were about a hundred in total. Seeing him in action reminded me of a certain gold-covered Heroic Spirit and the gate that lead to his treasury.</p>
<p>The magic beasts were overwhelmed; they were trapped by a cage of sword and assaulted by a bombardment of blades until they plummeted from the sky.</p>
<p>「Amazing.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, but I’d prefer not to get involved with him if possible.』</p>
<p>We didn't really know anything of the person’s nature. There was always the chance that coming into contact with him would to trouble and nothing else.</p>
<p>The person in question was currently making their way over to the magic beasts that they defeated. It was a pretty good time to leave, so we once again began heading back in Barbra’s direction.</p>

<p>Also, in the raws, they had this whole shallow/deep thing with the regions because they kept referring to it as a sea of trees. I got rid of it because it didn’t sound right in English, I don’t know what the word for the intermediate point between shallow and deep is. This choice has a chance of biting me in the ass later. Just calling it out ahead of time.</p>

		<p><b>108. Evil Kobold<br>
</b></p>
<p>「Master, over there. Lots of people.」</p>
<p>『It looks like they’re heading towards Barbra.』</p>
<p>「But… Bit off somehow.」</p>
<p>We spotted a few carriages along the road on our way back to the city.</p>
<p><span id="more-325"></span></p>
<p>That in itself was totally normal. Today was the day of the Lunar Banquet, and we were only about an hour away from the city. I wouldn’t be surprised in any which way if the carriages contained villagers looking to have a good time in town.</p>
<p>We were still pretty far away from the aforementioned carriages, so we couldn’t actually see it in all that much detail. We could, however, still tell that something didn’t seem quite right. I could’ve sworn that I heard a scream or two.</p>
<p>『Hmmm… I think they might be getting attacked by magic beasts.』</p>
<p>Drawing a bit closer led me to realize that my prior guess had hit the mark spot on. The carriages were being chased and attacked by kobolds.</p>
<p>『Urushi, fly over there as quickly as you can!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Dashing through the air allowed us to get a much better view of what was going on. That is, four adventurers were currently fighting off the kobold onslaught with all they had.</p>
<p>「Don’t give up Dregg!」</p>
<p>「Keep it up! The villagers will be screwed if we mess up here!」</p>
<p>「Don’t let these damn things past even if it costs us our lives!」</p>
<p>「I know! I know already! There’s no way in hell I’ll let em pass me till the carriage is far away enough!」</p>
<p>「That’s the way!」</p>
<p>The adventurers had leapt off the carriages in order to better stall their assailants by facing them head on. All four of them were clearly risking their lives in hopes of letting the five carriages they accompanied escape. None of the four seemed like they intended to back off or run away despite the fact that a few of them had already suffered several heavy injuries.</p>
<p>Damn, they be manly as hell.</p>
<p>「Will help.」</p>
<p>『Go ahead. The enemy’s leader should be… that one over there.』<br>

_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Its title and innate skill were both a bit weird, as they seemed to point to the fact that the kobold was one of the Evil God’s subordinates. Rather, that should’ve been a given seeing as how the kobold is classified as an evil being.</p>
<p>Was there supposed to be anything special about him though? Did he have those skills and titles because he had more of the Evil God’s divine protection than the average member of his species? I mean, relatively speaking, his stats were pretty high. He was quite a bit stronger than the Goblin King I defeated in the past.</p>
<p>Would I end up getting that Art of Evil skill if i I absorbed the kobold’s magic stone, and would absorbing it automatically bind me me to one of the Evil God in some way? Hmm… I’m not so sure trying it is what I'd call a good idea…</p>
<p>『Let’s try to avoid having me absorb the boss kobold's magic stone. Apparently it's bound to the Evil God, so I don’t think taking its abilities is that great an idea.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>『Urushi, we’ll be leaving any leftover weaklings to you.』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Fran leapt off Urushi’s back and used the force of her fall to split one of the kobolds in half. The kobolds were frozen in shock, but Fran didn't care. She began mowing weakling after weakling down with ease without so much as giving them a chance to recover from the impact of her sudden descent. Urushi did the same and proceeded to tear through enemy lines.</p>
<p>The pair's advent hadn't just left the kobolds speechless. It'd done the same to the adventurers and caused them to freeze in place.</p>
<p>It went without saying that the kobolds posed us no threat, but Fran refused to show them any mercy regardless. She unhesitantly chose to cast Inferno Burst, the most powerful spell in our arsenal.</p>
<p>「Roooahhhrghh!」</p>
<p>I was on guard because I was worried about the effects of the Evil God’s divine protection, but it turned out that my anxiety had been misplaced. In the end, the Evil Kobold was still just a kobold; Inferno Burst had roasted it and turned into nothing but a smoldering carcass in a matter of moments. We did manage to get ahold of its magic stone, but again, I didn’t feel like absorbing it, so I just chucked in storage instead.</p>
<p>The remaining kobolds immediately scattered upon losing their commander. The species as a whole was innately rather timid, but it seemed that having a strong leader had led them to act in a bit more of an ambitious manner. Losing said leader caused them to immediately regain their usual cowardice and flee. Oh well, whatever. They were weak and all, but honestly, chasing them down and killing them was a tedious waste of time, so we refrained.</p>
<p>All four adventurers had remained frozen for the entirety of the battle's two minute duration. It seemed as if they had yet to finish processing the events that had just perspired. They were unable to immediately grasp that a child and wolf had descended from the sky, beat the enemies that they’d been struggling with, and even sent them running with their tails between their legs.</p>
<p>「Area Heal」</p>
<p>It wasn’t until after Fran started treated their wounds that they finally managed to provide some sort of response.</p>
<p>「Wa, wahh?」</p>
<p>「W-We’re being healed?」</p>
<p>「T-thanks, you really saved us there.」</p>
<p>「What the hell just happened?」</p>
<p>Apparently the four of them were all members of a party by the name of Cedrus’ Winds. Their moniker originated from the fact that their base of operations was located in Cedrus Village, a small, nearby settlement.</p>
<p>They told this whole long ass emotional tale about how they hard they worked and the extent to which they endeavoured in order to become true adventurers before finally settling down in Cedrus. Honestly though, I wasn’t even the slightest bit interested, so the whole thing went in one ear and out the other.</p>
<p>What I did get from their story was that they were so thankful to the villagers that they were willing to risk their lives to protect them regardless of what kind injuries they suffered in the process. I didn't care for their flashbacks at all, but I honestly appreciated their actions for how manly they were.</p>
<p>All four of the adventurers took turns thanking Fran and shaking her hand. They offered to give her every single last one of the kobold’s corpses despite the fact kobolds would’ve been worth quite a bit to them given their rank. I had to say, they were pretty good people even if it looked kind of weird for them to surround Fran while thanking her profusely the way they did. I mean, free stuff was free stuff, and I liked free stuff, but we ultimately ended up refusing their offer in the interest of time. We didn’t really need kobolds for anything, and they weren't worth much to us, so yeah.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>The five carries that'd escaped a bit earlier quickly returned after noticing that kobolds had scattered. The villagers stepped out from within and all bowed their heads in turn to offer their thanks to the four adventurers that'd almost died saving them. The two groups really did seem to have a pretty good relationship with one another.</p>
<p>We asked the village chief a few quick things, and verified our expectations. We'd been right, they villagers within the carriages were currently on their way over to Barbra so that they could join in on the Lunar Banquet’s festivities.</p>
<p>「It’s pretty rare for Kobolds to be out here. The road is well travelled, so they normally stay far away, but most people have holed themselves in the city today because of the banquet.」</p>
<p>Anyone and everyone’s more or less taken today off because of the Lunar Banquet. The city was having trouble getting its usual patrols done; the lack of guards had left them understaffed.</p>
<p>We decided to give them a hand and stick with them until they reached the city. It was only an hour away, and I’d probably feel a bit guilty and overly conscious of my decisions if they ended up getting completely wiped out after we went through the trouble of helping them out once already.</p>
<p>The carriages only actually had six seats, so having two extra bodies made things a bit tight, especially with Urushi taking up the entire back seat. The villagers didn’t seem to mind at all though, given that they’d already seen Fran’s might. Besides, most of the people on the carriage we were in were children, so it wasn’t as bad as it otherwise could’ve been.</p>
<p>One of the villagers, a woman late in her prime, handed Fran a few dried potatoes. [1]</p>
<p>「Nom nom.」</p>
<p>「I like the way you eat! Here, try this too.」</p>
<p>「Om nom nom.」</p>
<p>「What a cute face you're making. Give this one a taste as well.」</p>
<p>「Om nom」</p>
<p>「You look so adorable! You’re just like a squirrel! Here, have another.」</p>
<p>「Nom om nom.」</p>
<p>The older ladies we were sitting with praised Fran in a bit of a shrill voice as they watched her stuff her cheeks.</p>
<p>Yup, they’ve got good eyes. Fran's super cute.</p>
<p>Riding Urushi would’ve made this whole trip a mere ten or so minutes, but Fran looked like she was enjoying herself. That, combined with the fact that they ended up telling us about all sorts of interesting, festival-related stuff, made riding the carriage well worth it.</p>
<p>The villagers were planning on staying in Barbra for a total of three days. Apparently, heading towards the city around this time of year was fairly common practice for anyone that lived in a village in Barbra’s immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons that they had such a practice was because they wished to sample the cooking contest’s products. Unfortunately, they as villagers weren’t exactly what you’d call rich. They didn’t have much money or time, so they could only afford to visit a maximum of four different stalls.</p>
<p>Apparently, traders and messengers had already informed all of the thirty or so villages nearby of the first round’s results despite the fact they’d only just been announced yesterday. The villagers themselves had also already figured out which of the four they wished to visit; they’d sorted it all out ahead time in the interest of efficiency. The swiftness and excitement contained within their actions really served to testify the event’s grand scale.</p>
<p>「It seems that Dordoros, last year’s winner, isn’t going to be participating this time around.」</p>
<p>「That’s because he got hired by the Kingdom of Norland. He’s now working as their royal chef.」</p>
<p>「Either way, we’re definitely going to go to The Dragon’s Table. They managed to win second last year, so they’ve gotta be good.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, but don’t be forgetting about Jeff’s Meaty Steakhouse.」</p>
<p>「We’re obviously going to The Seafood Skewery too. You can’t get stuff like that back in the village no matter where you look.」</p>
<p>「And of course, it goes without saying that we'll be visiting Barbra’s Orphange too, right?」</p>
<p>「Barbra’s Orphanage?」</p>
<p>Fran raised a question in response to the final item they listed. It didn’t really seem to make sense or fit in with the rest.</p>
<p>「Yup. The orphanage’s chef, Io, is really well known around here. They don’t really use any fancy ingredients, but their dishes are still really delicious. They tend to leave you feeling really relaxed.」</p>
<p>「We want to show the orphanage that we're supporting their actions, so we visit their stall every year.」</p>
<p>「You really have to hand it to the chef. I don’t quite know how they manage to make their dishes taste so good!」</p>
<p>「Right? I think the orphanage managed to come in fourth last year too.」</p>
<p>And so they went on and on and on.</p>
<p>I was pretty content with learning about the contest’s more famous participants, but, I couldn’t help but feel vexed that they’d already decided where they were going ahead of time. They weren’t the only ones either, apparently their mentality was pretty normal. In other words, newcomers to the competition like us were at a pretty big disadvantage.</p>
<p>That said, it wasn’t like we were really in that bad of a spot. Curry bread was an amazing product. It could be stored for a couple days on end without any issues, and it didn’t even need to be reheated seeing as how it was still good even when cold. We should be able to appeal to people looking for a snack or two between meals.</p>
<p>「Also participating in contest.」</p>
<p>「You are? Really?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Master entered. Helping out.」</p>
<p>「Are you working at that place called “The Black Tail?” I think I remember the chef’s name being Master…」</p>
<p>The Black Tail was the name I randomly came up with on the spot when they gave us our registration forms. It seemed to fit, as it reflected a property shared by both Fran and Urushi.</p>
<p>「Yup.」</p>
<p>「Nice. What kind of stuff are you guys selling?」</p>
<p>「Curry bread.」</p>
<p>「Never heard of it.」</p>
<p>「Master’s own recipe. Really tasty, even when cold. Lots of spices. Ten Golde each. Can be carried around easily. Good for snacks.」</p>
<p>The older ladies hopped right on Fran’s advertisements and immediately took her words to heart.</p>
<p>「Can they last a few days without going bad?」</p>
<p>「Yup. Works well for gifts.」</p>
<p>「Oh great! That means we'd able to buy a bunch and take them back for everyone in the village.」</p>
<p>「That sounds like a great idea. We’ll make sure we stop by your stall too then.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Will welcome with open arms.」</p>
<p>Yay for more customers!</p>

		<p><b>109. Dismantling</b></p>
<p>We immediately headed over to the Adventurer’s Guild after finally getting back to town.</p>
<p>The monsters we hunted had more than enough meat on them, but we still needed to process it before we could actually put it to use. To that end, we borrowed the guild’s dismantling room.<span id="more-335"></span></p>
<p>It was much larger than the one they had in Alessa. It had enough room for us to dismantle everything we had on hand and then some.</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s start with the Gullinbursti.』</p>
<p>I grabbed the golden boar and pulled it out of storage. We put it away the moment it away the moment it died, so its corpse had been preserved in as fresh a state as possible. In fact, it hadn’t even actually finished bleeding out. Magic beast blood was pretty useful when it came to stuff like medicine and food, so we decided to put all the boar’s blood back into storage as we butchered it.</p>
<p>「Nn. Tusks very thick.」</p>
<p>『Its fur looks like it’d fetch a pretty penny too.』</p>
<p>We only really wanted the beast's meat, but that didn’t mean we’d just throw rest away. Its body parts seemed quite valuable.</p>
<p>After finishing up with the boar, we moved onto the Apises and Gullinkambis in turn. All in all, we managed to get a total of about a tonne of “pork,” a tonne of “beef,” and three hundred kilograms of “chicken.” That said, we couldn’t actually use it all. Meat was meat, but some of the animals’ body parts were more compatible with curry than others.</p>
<p>Hmm… I guess I’ll use the “pork” for mild, the “beef” for medium and the “chicken” for hot.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>And so, we headed back over to the Luciel Conglomerate after finishing up with all our dismantling. We might've actually ended up missing the cooking guild’s deadline if we didn’t buy all our ingredients and get all our documentation done immediately.</p>
<p>『We should try checking with the conglomerate to see if they know where we can get ourselves some a room to cook in or something after we pick up all our stuff.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『Oh yeah, did you want to go check out the orphanage? It’s on the way.』</p>
<p>「Orphanage? Can’t eat there.」</p>
<p>『Well, yeah, but there's more to it than just that.』</p>
<p>Apparently, most stalls wouldn’t move all that far from their base of operations. For example, The Dragon’s Table stall would sit right in front of the store, and the orphanage’s stall would sit right in front of the orphanage. It was pretty easy to resupply given their immediate proximity to their associates, moreover, they could make use of their brands in order to attract a larger crowd of customers. I figured that we might as well find out where the orphanage’s stall would be given that it was en route anyways.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, we ended up paying the orphanage a quick visit, just to give it a look, but we were greeted by a bit of an unusual scenario.</p>
<p>「Kyaaa!」</p>
<p>「Waahhh! Wahhhhh!!」</p>
<p>「Alright, who’s fault wazzat? Whoever it was, get yer ass over here right now!」</p>
<p>A bunch of commotion was coming from within the orphanage’s gates. That is, we were greeted by the sounds of children crying and screaming, and the angry-sounding voice of an ill-mannered man.</p>
					
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>110. The Shadows of Conspiracy</b></p>
<p>「Hey! Ya recognize this?」</p>
<p>「W-Well…」</p>
<p>「It’s the stupid god damned recipe you gave me!」</p>
<p><span id="more-344"></span></p>
<p>We’d approached the orphanage in order to scout out one of our competitors, but we were immediately greeted by a series of furious shouts upon arrival.</p>
<p>The yells that came from within were excessively loud. We could easily hear them from outside the stone wall that enclosed the building. Our curiosity got the better of us, and we peeped in from the entrance so we could figure out exactly what was going on.</p>
<p>「I’m not about to let you get away with sayn that you ain't got no recollection of this god damn recipe.」</p>
<p>「Y-Yeah, I get it. I do remember, it’s the recipe you forced me to give you. You said you’d leave us alone if I handed it over.」</p>
<p>「Are you fucken retarded? I told you to hand over the soup recipe you use for the goddamn contest every goddamn year.」</p>
<p>「I-I did already.」</p>
<p>It looked like the orphanage was being harassed by a typical, a loan shark-esque grunt. They mentioned a recipe a few times, so it seemed like they were talking about something related to the contest.</p>
<p>The grunt that’d been shouting at the top of his lungs looked like like your usual everyday hoodlum.</p>
<p>A single woman stood between him and children, as if protecting the latter. She looked middle aged, and was wearing a robe over her overly thin figure.</p>
<p>「Did ya think you could get by just handing me off this incomplete piece of shit? There aint even any precise amounts, all you got is fucken guesswork written down here.」</p>
<p>「But that’s just how I normally prepare it…」</p>
<p>「Hah? Shut the hell up. You and I both know that there ain't no way in hell you can get past the prelims like that. This shit basically just says that you throw a bunch of random cheap ass vegetables into a stupid fucking pot. The fuck you think you’re trying to fool, bitch?」</p>
<p>「That really is how I prepare it! I don’t normally use any sort of measuring device at all. I just approximate!」</p>
<p>It looked like the the piece of paper the hoodlum was waving around contained the recipe for the orphanage’s signature soup. I’m pretty sure he used some sort of underhanded method to get his hands on it, but either way, he was complaining that it lacked completeness. And honestly, he technically was right. The recipe really didn’t have much written on it.</p>
<p>However, the woman wasn't lying. She’d been telling him the truth from the very start.</p>
<p>She simply never figured out exactly how much of each ingredient she used, but she managed to get fourth place overall last year in spite of that. I had to say that the sense of dissonance going on there really got me curious, and so, I appraised her, only to find that she, Io, was just about as amazing as one could possibly get as far as cooking went. She had cooking level nine, a skill that enhanced her sense of taste, and most importantly, divine protection from the God of Cuisine. In other words, she had been chosen by none other than the God that governed the realm of food himself.</p>
<p>To her, the act of approximating was probably akin to other people meticulously calculating exactly what was needed at any given point in time, except that it was done on the fly. In other words, she probably just went with her gut feeling while occasionally sampling her dish from time to time. Through the aforementioned method, she’d extract from her ingredients the best possible taste she could, regardless of their quality. It was a brilliant concept, but not one that the hoodlum before us could come to understand.</p>
<p>「I told you to cut the shit already!」</p>
<p>Annnnd yup. Figured as much.</p>
<p>（Master. Going to help.）</p>
<p>『Don’t hit him too hard, alright?』</p>
<p>（Nn. Got it.）</p>
<p>Fran used magic to silence the area, leapt over the fence, and snuck behind the hoodlum without alerting him.</p>
<p>「Listen here, bit-charhgh!」</p>
<p>She drilled her foot into the back of his head and caused his eyes to roll backwards. The hoodlum had been instantly deprived of his consciousness.</p>
<p>Wait, didn’t she say that she knew she was supposed like, not be too violent? I swear I told her that and that she agreed. I swear…</p>
<p>『Hey um, Fran? Whatever happened to not hitting him too hard?』</p>
<p>（Nn? Didn’t kill. Didn’t cut either.）</p>
<p>Er, I guess it’d be better for me to define “too hard” next time. Oh well, whatever. What’s done is done.</p>
<p>「I-I-I’m not sure as to who you are, but thank you very much for your assistance!」</p>
<p>Io thanked us repeatedly before finally calming down, at which point in time we asked her exactly what had happened.</p>
<p>「We’re not really all that sure either…」</p>
<p>Io seemed to not understand much about the precise events that transpired, but, she still tried her best to tell us everything she did know. Fortunately, her words were enough to give a rough idea as to the general circumstances.</p>
<p>It all started a few years ago. Barbra’s lord had suddenly stopped funding the orphanage for reasons unknown, and since then, they’d been suffering financially due to their lack of sustainable income. They were in such dire straits that they found it difficult to even scrape up enough money to allow the children to eat everyday.</p>
<p>They requested the lord to change his mind time and time again, but, he never once agreed to reinstate their funding. The orphanage was later approached by a merchant apparently introduced by said lord. He’d been willing to lend them money at a low interest rate, but that didn’t end up working out either.</p>
<p>「The merchant refused to budge on the repayment date, and said that it was set in stone, but it was way too unrealistic. There was no way we could possibly make three hundred thousand Golde in just half a year… We wanted to ask him to extend deadline, but we were never able to find his whereabouts.」</p>
<p>「Nn? Unable to find whereabouts?」</p>
<p>「The director did his very best to try and locate the merchant, but we never were able to figure out where he went. It turned out that he wasn’t actually registered with Barbra’s Merchant’s Guild.」</p>
<p>Okay yeah, if that isn’t suspicious, then I don’t know what is. In fact, it was pretty obvious that they were just being used and exploited from the very start. I mean, they were offered a decently sized loan with low interest rate loan right when they needed it. Moreover, they were asked to repay it within an impossibly quick time frame. The merchant had obviously wanted something other than money, and they probably would’ve ended up saying that they didn’t get the money even if they had been paid.</p>
<p>Honestly, it was a pretty cliche situation. The only difference was that they were demanding the soup’s recipe as opposed to more normal things like the orphanage’s land or children.</p>
<p>「That hoodlum. Merchant’s underling?」</p>
<p>「I think so. He told us to hand him the recipe instead of paying them back in half a year.」</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, looks like this probably does have something to do with the whole cooking contest. But wouldn’t setting this whole thing up need a lot of prep work? They basically just threw down three hundred thousand Golde for no reason too. Though, I guess most chefs wouldn’t find three hundred thousand to be all that much considering that they were probably investing more than just that into this whole contest thing.</p>
<p>I mean, fine, that can be justified, but why only the recipe? Couldn’t they have just forced the orphanage not to participate instead?</p>
<p>Yeahhhh, I don’t get it. I kind of want to interrogate the hoodlum we have over here, but, that probably wasn’t exactly the best idea. Using violence would ultimately end up bringing trouble to the orphanage as well, sooooo yeah, let’s not.</p>
<p>Doing it after dragging him elsewhere wouldn’t work either. I’d really like to avoid getting targeted by some sort of weird underground organisation.</p>
<p>（Master. What to do with hoodlum?）</p>
<p>『Hmmm.. Well, we can’t really just ditch and not say anything, so let’s mess with his head a bit, I guess.』</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">

        </div>
        
<p>（Nn!）</p>
<p>The fact that he didn’t see Fran sneak up on him gave us more than just a few options. We had everything we needed to deal with this situation however we pleased.</p>
<p>『Alright, make sure you stick to the plan.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Heal.」</p>
<p>「Huh?」</p>
<p>「Woke up?」</p>
<p>「Ugh… What happened?」</p>
<p>「Passed out while conversing.」</p>
<p>「I did?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Adventurer. Happened to be passing by, witnessed your collapse. Used recovery magic to help.」</p>
<p>The plan we had ended up going with was pretending that we had nothing to do with the man collapsing at all. In fact, we wanted him to feel as if we’d lent him a hand.</p>
<p>「Sorry, seems like I caused you a bitta trouble.」</p>
<p>「Suddenly collapsing. Sign of serious illness. If collapsing while talking, might be late stages.」</p>
<p>「R-Really? You serious?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Need to leave now. Might be better to get some rest.」</p>
<p>「Y-Yeah, you’re right.」</p>
<p>「Good idea.」</p>
<p>「H-Hey, you shits! I’mma be leaving for now, but don’t think I won’t be back! You owe me a recipe goddamit!」</p>
<p>I managed to project the effects of the Principle of Falsehood onto Fran’s words because she had me equipped. Honestly, I was quite surprised that it actually worked.</p>
<p>Fran was really bad at acting, but the skill’s effects, combined with the fact that he was still groggy, made it so he ended up believing her wholeheartedly. He gave the orphanage one last angry shout before finally turning around and limping his way out the entrance.</p>
<p>『Urushi, follow him.』</p>
<p>（Growl.）</p>
<p>At the very least, having Urushi follow the man around would allow him to memorize his scent. If we were lucky, he’d be able to figure who the man’s companions were, and if we were really lucky, we might even be able to figure out the so called mysterious loan shark’s identity. In any case, it was still win-win situation, as knowing the man’s scent would allow us to track his actions and prevent him from pulling a fast one during the contest itself.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Five or so minutes passed.</p>
<p>「Thank you so much for everything you’ve done for us. Are you sure you don’t want anything else?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran was currently inside the orphanage. Io had asked her whether or not she wanted anything in return for helping them out, and so, the adventurer had asked to try some of the orphanage's ever so famous soup, to which the caretaker responded with an okay.</p>
<p>「Thank you.」</p>
<p>The person in question herself didn’t think that the soup really sufficed as thanks, as it was basically only made with the cheapest of vegetables. But in spite of that fact, it was delicious, so delicious that it’d even caused Fran’s expression to change.</p>
<p>『How is it?』</p>
<p>I asked Fran the question despite already knowing the answer she’d give. Her face was twisted in what could only be described as frustration.</p>
<p>（Yummy.）</p>
<p>『Better than the soup I make?』</p>
<p>（Nn… Soup stock extracted perfectly. Tastes miralculous.）</p>
<p>I had to agree that the soup’s taste seemed to have been the work of some sort of miracle. It wasn’t like any of the stuff we saw at the other restaurants. Its was comprised of cheap vegetables, well water, and salt. That was it. Nothing more, nothing less. I had Fran double check by asking her, and it turned out that she really hadn't even used any pepper. Yet, it still tasted even better than the stuff I made. Like, holy crap. It was just that amazing. She was probably honestly Barbra’s most talented chef.</p>
<p>「Entering King of Cooking?」</p>
<p>「That’s the plan.」</p>
<p>「Going to use this soup?」</p>
<p>「Yes, I am. Barbra’s people are really nice. They know about how much trouble we’re having with our finances, so they’re even willing to pay as much as 10 Golde for just a single bowl. I’m really grateful for their actions, the earnings we make from the contest have been helping us by. We probably wouldn’t have lasted as long as we did without everyone’s generosity…」</p>
<p>She didn’t have much self confidence and seemed to believe that people only bought her soup as a form of donation. Well, I mean, I can’t say that sympathy didn’t play a part in the soup’s sales figures, but honestly, the soup would’ve sold well even without it. I mean, just look at how Fran reacted. It was so good that it'd caused her emotions to well up in frustration.</p>
<p>Her price point was the same as ours, but each bowl would earn her much more profit than each serving of curry bread would for us given the discrepancy in the cost of our ingredients. She’s going to be making something far outside the realm of just one gold per sale. Her fourth place spot was rightfully deserved.</p>
<p>A thin, freckled girl approached us as Fran finished her soup. She presented to her a small plate with a single cookie lying on top of it.</p>
<p>「What’s that?」</p>
<p>「It’s supposed to be my snack, but I’m giving it to you because you helped Ms. Io. Thank you, <i>onee-chan</i>.」[1]</p>
<p>She pushed the cookie towards Fran whilst smiling shyly. She probably really wanted it for herself, but she was willing to give it up regardless.</p>
<p>What a good girl she is! I mean, she can’t hold a candle to Fran, but she’s still a really good girl!</p>
<p>Fran split the cookie with the girl and ate it while giving her head a gentle rub. Fran was always used to being treated as a child, so she seemed really happy that someone had looking up to her as something along the lines of an elder sister.</p>
<p>Alright, you know what? I’ve come to a conclusion. Barbra’s lord is a piece of shit. He ended abandoning some city’s most adorable children. How dare he discontinue his funding!</p>
<p>『I think it’s time for us to get in touch with <i>her</i>.』</p>
<p>（Nn. Agreed.）</p>
<p>The guild has the ability to quickly send messages to other branches, meaning we should be able to get in touch with the Alessa branch fairly easily.</p>
<p>「Won’t stay silent. Amanda, that type of person.」</p>
<p>『Yup, let’s do what we can for them.』</p>
<p>And so, we left the orphanage, but not before leaving with them some of the stuff we bought back in Alessa and Dharz. We gave them grains, potatoes, dried meat, and dried fish, stuff meant to last a while even if you just kept it on the shelf. The quantity we had on hand was rather limited, but hopefully, it was at least enough to brighten their days and let them eat healthier, more delicious meals.</p>
<p>[1] I’ve normally been avoiding leaving in Japanese words and stuff, but it’s difficult to really convey the meaning without it in this case. I’m too lazy to localize such a large chunk, and stuff. I've basically given myself a 5 minute upper limit for localization per chapter, with the exception of names because they're hard. Anyway, <i>onee-chan</i> in Japanese means “elder sister” in English if you take it from a literal standpoint. However the connotations differ vastly between the two languages. <i>Onee-chan</i> is also often used to refer to females who are older than you, or females in their mid-late twenties. The second of the three cases I mentioned is the one used here, and it tends to imply that the individual saying the word is feeling some attachment to the individual they addressing. In this case, you could say that the line is supposed to imply that the little girl is warming up to Fran. This is meant to contrast the shy smile she later gave in order to make her seem more cute.</p>
<p>Speaking of honorifics, you guys are the audience, so I’m going to ask you whether or not you actually want them in general. My current style involves use honorifics only when <s>I get really lazy </s> it would be too much work/too difficult/too time consuming to rewrite the section and express the thought differently. Do you guys like this, or would you prefer that I just leave them in as they were in the raw?</p>
<p>I’m not going to be making a strawpoll or anything for the time being, but I might if the feedback is split like 50/50-ish.</p>

		<p><b>111. Preparing Things in Advance<br>
</b><br>
The first thing we did after leaving the orphanage was to head over to the Adventurer’s Guild so we could ask them to assist us in sending the Alessa branch a message.</p>
<p>I’d assumed that all communication was done through the use of some sort of magic item, so I was completely blindsided by the fact that they were using carrier pigeons. Well, not exactly carrier pigeons, but something along those lines. To be precise, the messages were being carried by hawk-like magic beasts.</p>
<p><span id="more-351"></span></p>
<p>The carrier hawks' were a species of magic beast called Wind Eagles. They specialized in high speed flight, and as a result, were ranked as E level threats. In fact, they were so quick that the one we’d just sent over to Alessa was due to reach its destination within the day.</p>
<p>The hawks were really convenient given the fact that they could cover large amounts of ground in very little time, but the guild didn’t actually have all that many on hand. Even the Barbra branch only had two in total. As one could presume from that fact alone, they were not only expensive to use, but also fairly busy. I guess you could say that we were pretty lucky that our message was actually sent off immediately.</p>
<p>And by the way, expensive meant <i>expensive. </i>Sending just that one letter cost us an entire ten thousand Golde. Ten thousand! I’d almost felt like just taking our money and flat out donating it to the orphanage instead, but I ended up sending the letter anyways, as I rationalized that it would still probably end up be the better investment in the long run.</p>
<p>Now, with that said, Fran and I were both fully aware that Amanda wasn’t actually allowed to leave Alessa, but that didn’t mean she wouldn't be able to help us. It might be possible for her to pull a few strings in order to get Barbra’s lord to start giving the orphanage money again. Likewise, we might also be able to make use her name in order to discourage those that looked at the orphanage with their eyes filled with malicious intent.</p>
<p>Naturally, the letter contained more than just our request for assistance. We first wrote a bit about ourselves and our most recent experiences and accomplishments before moving to explaining the orphanage’s less than satisfactory circumstances. The reason we saved the orphanage stuff for last was so we could purposefully finished the letter off by saying, “There are many children in need that would greatly benefit from your help. Could you please lend them a hand?” It had much more impact that way. I was aware that we were kind of just pushing the whole thing onto her, but we didn't hesitate in seeking her help. We figured that Amanda would have more than enough influence and ability to actually get something done. This was more than just our problem, so I felt it necessary to make use of every resource we possibly could.</p>
<p>「Woof woof.」</p>
<p>『Welcome back, Urushi.』</p>
<p>Urushi came back from his hoodlum-filled adventure right as we finished up all our guild-related business.</p>
<p>I kind of wanted to head over to the Luciel Conglomerate immediately, but I was more interested in the result of Urushi’s investigations, so we first decided to follow him back to the place from which he just returned despite it being in the conglomerate’s opposite direction.</p>
<p>『So he went in here?』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Urushi had guided us over to the town’s residential area, where we found ourselves standing before a massive mansion with a five meter tall fence lining its property. It size was indicative of the fact that it probably belonged to some sort of noble.</p>
<p>I’d really wished that it had something as convenient as a nameplate, but reality was pretty much never that convenient.</p>
<p>What we needed was information. We couldn't make any sort of decision or come to any sort of conclusion without it, so we decided to ask around and gather as much of it as we could.</p>
<p>Fran’s still a kid, so luckily, her posing a few questions wouldn’t really lead to her being suspected of anything malicious. All she needed to do to get people to divulge the information she wanted was to put on a bit of an act. It was a shame that Urushi couldn’t get any smaller, else we could probably use him to play the good old puppy card as well.</p>
<p>Whenever we came across a man, we’d have Fran give her head a bit of a tilt whilst gazing up into his eyes. Seeing her act like that pretty much caused every man we came across to immediately become as obedient as could be.</p>
<p>「Hey, mister?」</p>
<p>「Y-Yes? Did you need something?」</p>
<p>Most of them reacted as if they were charmed. It seemed like having Fran interact with them in the manner she had had caused them to awaken to a new sort of interest. Whoops, my bad. That uh, wasn’t intentional. Hahaha…</p>
<p>Women were approached in a much more natural fashion. They seemed to act much more amicably when Fran retained her usual, expressionless face.</p>
<p>「Excuse me, ma’am.」</p>
<p>「Yes?」</p>
<p>「That mansion. Looks really big. Owned by nobles?」</p>
<p>「Now that you mention it, I think it might be biggest one in this neighborhood, so maybe.」</p>
<p>「Looks like owner has bad taste. Poorly decorated.」</p>
<p>「Ahahaha, you’re right about that one. No one knows exactly who owns it though.」</p>
<p>「Don’t know?」</p>
<p>「Well, this is just a rumor, but, apparently it’s currently being occupied by some shady folk. They say that you only ever see people going in and out of the building in the middle of the night.」</p>
<p>「Illegal, underground organisation?」</p>
<p>「That’s what I thought too, but I hear that some of the carriages that visit the building on a regular basis are said to have the city’s lord’s crest on them.」</p>
<p>「Lord involved with underground?」</p>
<p>「I don’t know about that. The lord isn’t the only one that has access to carriages with his crest on it.」</p>
<p>Most of the conversations we had were more or less along that same vein. In the end, we never were able to figure out exactly who the mansion belonged to. All we got were more rumours about how the place was being used by “bad people.” Moreover, everyone we conversed with would always lower their voices and check their surroundings before telling us anything about the aforementioned rumours.</p>
<p>『Hey Urushi, were there a lot of people inside?』</p>
<p>（Woof. Bark bark.）</p>
<p>Urushi replied with several dog noises in order to answer my question affirmatively.</p>
<p>『Hmm… then breaking in probably isn’t that great an idea.』</p>
<p>I mean, they were suspicious and all, but we didn’t actually have any evidence of their guilt.</p>
<p>Oh well, whatever. We figured out where their base was. That alone more than sufficed for the time being.</p>
<p>『Did you memorize their scents?』</p>
<p>（Woof.）</p>
<p>We don’t know if they’ll actually try to interfere with our business at all, but it was much better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Alright, next up, the Luciel Conglomerate! They even might have a bit of info on this place as well, who knows?</p>
<p>And so, time passed; an hour flew by as we went about our business.</p>
<p>「Alright! I think that should be all of it.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Thanks.」</p>
<p>「Don’t sweat it, the pleasure was mine. Make sure you knock the contest’s other participants out of the water.」</p>
<p>The oil, vegetables, and flour that we ordered from the conglomerate were already all prepped for us, so we went ahead and picked them up. I was honestly quite surprised by how quickly they managed to get everything ready, I guess their size and reputation really weren't just for show. Rengil had actually gone out of his way to get us a carriage and some professional help for the sake of transporting all the goods we bought, so he was left completely stupefied by the fact that we managed to casually just store it all away within another dimension. I felt kind of guilty for putting his effort to waste, but well, we didn't really need what we didn't need. That's kind of just how things were.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>He was really impressed by the amount of storage space we had. In fact, he’d even gone as far as to ask us whether or not we would be willing to work in transport going forward. Users of space/time magic would often have large item boxes, and the size of their dimensional pockets would scale with their degree of skill, but most weren’t even able to come anywhere close to reproducing anything as spacious as what we had. Space/time magicians were already rare enough as is, so what we had was something along the lines of a one in a million enigma. It made sense though, we weren’t just using space/time magic, we also had a separate dimensional storage skill. It would've been weird for us not stand out. Apparently, most merchants would be willing to pay out the ass for that much storage space.</p>
<p>Our purchases weren’t limited to just edibles. We’d also ordered from the conglomerate a bunch of paper bags so that we could make things easier on our customers. Much to my surprise, Barbra had access to such a vast supply of paper that even the common folk were seen using it on a regular basis. Apparently, paper products were, in general, split into two categorizations. Regular paper was pretty much used by just about everybody, whereas parchment was only used for tasks involving magic.</p>
<p>Either way, the paper bags we got from the conglomerate were identical to the ones I was used to seeing back in Japan, just… not as high quality. They were plain, brown, made of cheap material, and came in two sizes. The smaller size fit up to two servings of curry bread, and the larger size six. Each bag also had a bit of an open grip on top in order to make it easier to carry.</p>
<p>「We still have a lot of those bags in stock, so feel free to just drop by if you ever need any more.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>Another thing we did before departing was asking Rengil if he knew anything about the mansion we’d just investigated. Unfortunately, he didn’t. However, he did get all heated up after hearing about the orphanage’s circumstances. He said that he was going to ask a few of his contacts to do some investigation, for which we were thankful.</p>
<p>「And last but not least would be… this.」</p>
<p>「Key?」</p>
<p>「I think you mentioned something about needing a place to cook, right? That key’ll get you into a restaurant that shut down about a month ago. No one’s bought the place yet, so it’s kind of just been sitting there without purpose. We’ve left the place as it was when it got vacated, so it should still have all the necessary utensils and the like. I don’t particularly mind lending it to you for a few days.」</p>
<p>He showed us over to the so called abandoned restaurant. The stove and stuff still all looked intact, and the there was even an area to store water in the back. The conglomerate had been taking good care of the place despite it being empty, so it wasn’t really all dusty or anything like that. It was pretty much exactly what we needed, and so, we ended up borrowing it for about a week's worth of time.</p>
<p>Alright! That’s everything we need. All we need to do now is to carry it all over to the Chef’s Guild so we can report our costs. Errr, wait, no. I have to get all the water ready first.</p>
<p>『Okay, why don’t we get down to making that magic-infused water we were going to use?』</p>
<p>「Nn. Where? Bathroom?」</p>
<p>『I think it’d be better if we used soil magic to make ourselves a pool or something.』</p>
<p>There was a large dirt floor to one side of the kitchen we were given, so we didn’t have to worry about anyone overseeing our activities. But first, we actually needed do a quick experiment. That is, we needed to figure out how much of the Potion of Attribute Reversal we needed to use per litre of swamp water. We also needed to determine whether it’d be better to use the swamp water or the Highest Grade Poison Mixture as our base. To that end, I started by making a bunch of smaller containers so we could do all the testing we needed.</p>
<p>「Nn. Looks interesting.」</p>
<p>「Woof. Ruff.」</p>
<p>「Next, this.」</p>
<p>「Bark bark!」</p>
<p>「Nn? This one?」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Our tests ended up taking the form of something along the lines of a science experiment; we mixed a bunch of chemicals and watched as they reacted with each other whilst documenting the results. Fran had so much fun with it that she even ended up getting Urushi to secrete a bit of his poison so she could conduct some additional testing.</p>
<p>The cost of our products would skyrocket if we used stuff that was way too effective, so, after consulting with Rengil, we ended up coming to the conclusion that it’d best for us to use the Water of Recovery. The Water of Recovery had the ability to restore any negative status conditions inflicted within the past few days. The aforementioned limitation seemed to function as compensation for the prominence of its effects.</p>
<p>I didn’t really get the whole distinction, but apparently, it didn’t count as a potion. A potion was strictly defined as a type of medicine. For some odd reason, magic-infused water didn't fit under that classification and instead was put in its own category.</p>
<p>Either way, we experimented. We mixed a whole bunch of swamp water, poison, magically created water, and alchemically created water in the name of science.</p>
<p>It took a whole bunch of testing, but in the end we finally managed to find the right mixture and ultimately mass produce the Water of Recovery that we’d been wanting. Though, I think we ended up producing way too much of the stuff. Oh well, again, better safe than sorry, so whatever.</p>
<p>『Whew. That’s everything. Let’s whip up a quick test batch and then head on over to the Chef’s Guild.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Finally.」</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>I've noticed that some of you guys have been mentioning that honorifics add extra meaning, and I guess it’s partially my fault because of how I phrased my TL note. <s>I may or may not have been trying to come off as less lazy than I actually was.</s> While they do function to that end in some specific cases, honorifics providing more meaning is, in general, actually a misnomer.</p>
<p>Translators are typically capable of retaining connotation without the use of honorifics. This is done through careful choice of diction. You'd probably be surprised at how easy it is to construct a section so that it more or less gives off the exact same feel as its raw. The only difference between the expression of a character’s emotions and views in English and Japanese is the manner in which it is presented. That is, the honorifics used in Japanese make certain aspects more explicit. This, however, is something that the translator should be covering for. If a translator fails to convey a character’s tone of speech, then it’s generally not due to the lack of an honorific, but instead because the translator lacked the skill to do so. This is often occurs because the translator lacks the ability to read undertones in Japanese. The worse and slightly more common case is that the translator lacks the ability to rewrite the aforementioned undertones in English. The final case is that they were probably just being lazy like I was yesterday. That is, “too much work/too difficult/too time consuming” all actually mean the same thing: I was being a lethargic bum and didn’t want to sit down for like 7 minutes to alter a small section so it worked better in English. I normally don't mind doing this.</p>
<p>The question was moreso just asking whether or not you enjoyed them from an aesthetic standpoint.</p>
<p>Note that none of what I've explained above is applicable to low quality translations.</p>

		<p><b>112. Curry Bread Complete!<br>
</b></p>
<p>『Alright, they’re done.』</p>
<p>The batch I had in front me looked almost identical to the stuff I used to see in stores back when I was still in Japan.</p>
<p><span id="more-356"></span></p>
<p>「Leave taste testing to me.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof bark woof!」</p>
<p>Both Fran and Urushi approached with their tails wagging the moment I pulled the curry bread out of the oil. They literally didn't even give me a chance to wring it dry. Didn’t they already have their afternoon snacks? I could’ve sworn they did…</p>
<p>『Hold on a bit. Wait till all the oil drips off of it.』</p>
<p>「Whaaa」</p>
<p>「Whimper…」</p>
<p>Both impatiently sat down right in front of the final product I’d just produced. Sitting there and staring isn’t going to make time go by any faster, you know…?</p>
<p>There were three different types and six pieces of each type for a total of 18 servings overall. The first type was mild and filled with pork, its exterior was the most plain, and appeared to have a simple, reddish-brown shade. The second type had slightly spicier beef curry inside of it, and could be differentiated by a thin layer of red pepper powdered atop its exterior. The final type was made of chicken. Unlike the other two, it was made to be super spicy. Moreover, it was the only one decorated in green; its exterior was accented with a parsey-like vegetable.</p>
<p>It took about fifteen minutes for the curry bread to cool down a bit and all the excess oil to dry off. Funny enough, neither Fran nor Urushi had seemed to avert their gazes for even the slightest moment.</p>
<p>I immediately stored half of them away so we could pass a few samples over to the Chef’s Guild. The other half, I left to a certain pair of gluttons.</p>
<p>『They’re ready now, go ahead and dig in.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>Both immediately pounced upon the dish the moment they got the green light.</p>
<p>「Yummy yummy yummy.」</p>
<p>「Ruff ruff ruff.」</p>
<p>Fran finished one of the pork types in a mere three bites. Naturally, she didn’t manage to swallow it immediately, so I asked her for her impressions as she chewed.</p>
<p>『How is it?』</p>
<p>「Ideal. Curry with rice reaches heavens. Curry bread ascends to nirvana.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>The hell is she saying? Are we in cooking manga land right now or something?</p>
<p>Oh well, whatever. Either way, it’s delicious, and that’s all that matters.</p>
<p>「This one. Also tasty.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>『Looks like Urushi likes the second type more than he likes the first. What about you, Fran?』</p>
<p>「Can’t decide. Both equally delicious.」</p>
<p>It looked like Fran even liked the one with medium levels of spiciness. Hmm… What about the spiciest kind?</p>
<p>「Spicy. Yummy. Spicy.」</p>
<p>『Woof woof woof!』</p>
<p>Alright, looks like that didn’t really work for her nearly as well as the other two did. Urushi, on the other hand, liked the spiciest type the most.</p>
<p>Hmm… alright, so how much of each type should I make? I mean, the super spicy type isn’t really for everybody, but I'm sure some people will be craving it… Wait, what if I started with just the two less spicy types and then added the third type on the second day? I’m pretty sure that’d end up grabbing more customers because people would start talking about it.</p>
<p>『Oh well, either way, it looks like they’re pretty good, so let’s pack up and head over to the Chef’s Guild for the time being.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>We were shown to a large underground room after we arrived at the Chef’s Guild. It’s ceiling was rather expensive and fancy looking, but for some odd reason, its size seemed to make it feel more like a gym than some sort of expensive facility.</p>
<p>「Could you please place all the ingredients you’re going to be using in this room? We can head over to where you’ve got your ingredients stored in the case that you’ve got too many to carry. The same applies if it’s too difficult for you transport them over.」</p>
<p>「Fine. No problems.」</p>
<p>「Are you sure? I don’t think it’ll be that efficient for you to have to keep going back and forth even if you do have an item box…」</p>
<p>「Nn. Taking ingredients out now.」</p>
<p>「Huh? Wait, what?」</p>
<p>Fran had entered the room empty-handed, so the receptionist seemed to have assumed that she’d brought some stuff via an item box and left the rest in a warehouse or something.</p>
<p>Apparently that’s how most of the other contestants did things. They’d normally call a representative over instead of actually going to the guild and bringing all their materials with them.</p>
<p>The shock the receptionist experienced from seeing Fran pull item after item out of her dimensional storage had initially caused her to stare with a blank look on her face, but she quickly recovered and started to do her job.</p>
<p>She immediately began using a skill in order to assess the value of what we'd brought.</p>
<p>「Let’s see… Vegetables, flour, a barrel of oil, a large quantity of spices, and…」</p>
<p>She recorded each of her observations in a notepad as she went through them.</p>
<p>「Is this magic-infused water? How luxurious. Wow, you’ve even got Gullinbursti, Apis, and Gullinkambi meat!」</p>
<p>It took her about an hour to go through everything. All in all, our ingredients were worth about a hundred and fifty thousand Golde. If we used them all up, we’d end up making about thirty thousand servings of curry bread, meaning we’d profit five Golde a piece if we kept our prices at 10 Golde each. The cost was actually a lot higher than what I’d anticipated it to be.</p>
<p>That said, it wasn’t actually that bad. It would’ve been much worse in Japan given that we would’ve had to pay for utilities and all sorts of other overhead costs. Labour costed much more over there too.</p>
<p>Most of the contest’s participants were chefs who focused purely on the pursuit of taste. As a result, their costs were rather high, and naturally, the prices for their products followed the same general sort of trend. Our strategy, which involved selling a large quantity at a low price, seemed like it was quite viable in comparison.</p>
<p>Another important factor to note was that the profit calculation itself was actually a bit skewed. It only included ingredients used directly in the dishes themselves, so stuff like labour and the cost of our paper bags were ignored and considered personal expenses as opposed to business expenses. That said, contestants were prohibited from bundling their dishes with overly expensive tableware as it’d skew the results in favour of anyone that happened to have extra cash on hand.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Alright, next, we’ll need a sample of your product so that we can judge its qualifications.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Wow! What a delicious yet mysterious flavour it has.」</p>
<p>The employee seemed to be well deserving of her position, given that she was able to immediately recognize the curry bread's flavour as an uncommon one. Moreover, the very first bite had already led her to nod in approval.</p>
<p>「I see, so you’re planning to put out multiple different flavours. The taste seems to match with the ingredients used, so you should be good to go.」</p>
<p>She used the “Tongue of Analysis” skill in order to examine the curry bread as she ate it. Its effect was to immediately identify every ingredient used in whatever she was eating. Okay, seriously, are we in a cooking manga right now? Because that’s totally something that looked like it was ripped right out of one.</p>
<p>The staff member lead us over to a place with a whole bunch of different carts and stalls after she finished checking over our ingredients. All participants had to pick one of several types pre-prepared by the guild.</p>
<p>We immediately chose one that didn’t really have that big of a prep area. Instead, it had a large display area with enough space for three different sales people.</p>
<p>Another requirement that we'd yet to fulfill was the creation of the sign we were going to hang atop our stall. The guild said that we could just figure out a design and hand it to them. They’d handle the rest. Our shop’s name was going to be called The Black Tail, so we just quickly drew a black cat’s tail and stuck the shop's name beside it before calling it a day.</p>
<p>And that was pretty much it. The only other thing we had to do was hand over the recipe. After that, we'd be golden.</p>
<p>「This.」</p>
<p>「Right, the recipe. Don’t worry about it leaking out to the public. We’re extremely careful and will ensure that it won't happen.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Done now?」</p>
<p>「Y-Yes, you are, but I do have to say that you sure did treat your recipe really casually.」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「Most of our participants enclose it in an envelope in order to ensure that it isn’t seen by any unintended onlookers. They’re also usually quite hesitant about handing over their recipes.」</p>
<p>We kind of just scribbled it on a piece of paper and handed it to them, so I guess it only makes sense for the staff members to be relatively confused.</p>
<p>「They tend to get especially fussy when their dishes are as unique and original as your own.」</p>
<p>「Not making fuss because trusting guild.」</p>
<p>「That's good to hear. Your trust is well placed, we promise that we'll do our best to keep it safeguarded.」</p>
<p>「Then no problem at all.」</p>
<p>Honestly, we could care less if the recipe ended up getting out anyways. It’s not actually an original recipe in the first place, so I don't really feel the urge to be all secretive about it or anything like that.</p>
<p>I mean, we could honestly probably sell it for a lot, but, weren't really in need of money or anything, and we’d probably make more from hunting magic beasts anyway.</p>
<p>Besides, I don’t actually see any problems with having the recipe leak. In fact, Fran would probably be happier that way. Local adaptations of it would likely lead to even more variety, which, in turn, would mean more curry for her.</p>
<p>So to sum that all up, there’s no point in us intentionally giving out the recipe for free, but we wouldn’t really care even if it did get leaked.</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s head back and start getting everything ready.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Awesome. Time for me to stay up all night and make about five thousand of each type of curry bread. I was planning to have Fran make a few in person at the stall, but honestly, that was just something we were going to do to attract customers. Most of what we were going to sell would be made in advance. We won’t have to worry about our supplies running dry that way.</p>
<p>I mean, normally, you'd be concerned about the excess food going to waste, but that didn't really apply to us. We could keep it in storage for as long as we wanted, and neither Urushi nor Fran would mind keeping them around as snacks.</p>
<p>「Well if it isn’t Miss Fran!」</p>
<p>「Colbert? Here, why?」</p>
<p>Colbert called out to us the moment we left the Chef’s Guild’s basement and went back to its lobby.</p>
<p>「I was actually looking for you! The contest’s going to start tomorrow, so I was checking to see if you need any sort of help.」</p>
<p>You could tell at a glance that he was totally brimming with excitement and motivation.</p>
<p>「I can tell you for a fact that I really do just want to help! I’m totally not hoping that there’s a chance I’ll be able to sample a bit of the Master’s cuisine. Not at all.」</p>
<p>Oh, so that’s what he was actually after. Well, I guess that’s fair. I don’t mind feeding him a bit if that’s all it takes for him to lend us a hand.</p>
<p>（Master, what do?）</p>
<p>『Maybe try asking him if he knows anyone that could help out as a salesperson?』</p>
<p>I was actually planning on having Rengil refer us a few people, but, an adventurer would probably work even better seeing as how they could function as both a salesperson and a guard simultaneously.</p>
<p>「Looking for people to help with sales. Requirement. Good at math. Even better if can cook. Ideally party of three.」</p>
<p>「Just leave it to me! I’ll find you three helpers by tomorrow morning!」</p>
<p>「Paying well.」</p>
<p>「Got it, that should make things even easier. I’ll get you the best help possible, just you wait!」</p>
<p>Alright, that’s that out of the way. We still have two days left until the second round actually begins. In the meantime, I’ll make sure I cook up the world’s best ever curry bread!</p>
<p>『You want to help out, Fran?』</p>
<p>「Nn. Will do my best.」</p>
<p>『I’ll leave keeping watch to you, Urushi!』</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>

		<p><b>113. The Lunar Banquet</b></p>
<p>Silence filled the kitchen as we got ready to cook.</p>
<p>First up on our list of things to prepare was spices.</p>
<p><span id="more-360"></span></p>
<p>Not all the spices we had on hand would actually serve to improve the flavour of our curry bread, so we had to sort them and put the ones we weren’t going to use aside. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that our choice of spices could either make or break the final product altogether. Next, we began mixing the spices with as much care as humanly pos—</p>
<p>— Or not. I’d planned on proceeding with caution, but Urushi totally chucked that out the window by sniffing at our ingredients. Normally, that alone wasn’t much of a cause for concern, but it caused a chain reaction by sending a few spices flying towards Fran, who in turn sneezed and then caused more spices to go all over the place.</p>
<p>『Alright, how about you guys go do something else while I get all the spices prepped?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Whimper…」</p>
<p>I’d honestly wanted to use a doppelganger so I could check the taste and smell as I went along with the whole cooking process, but I ended up dropping the idea altogether. I couldn’t maintain my doppelgangers for all that long, so it’d be better to keep the skill off cooldown just in case we happened to run into some sort of emergency.</p>
<p>I asked Fran to focus on prepping the other ingredients. It'd not only prevent any additional incidents, but also help a lot in the long run, as I wouldn't have to deal with nearly as much prep work myself later.</p>
<p>「Will prep well.」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>『Hmm, yeah, it doesn’t really look like there’s anything for you to do. Sorry Urushi.』</p>
<p>「Whimper whimper…」</p>
<p>『Yeah, I know you want to help, but it is what it is.』</p>
<p>「Woof woof woof!」</p>
<p>『I know, I can see that, but I’m not really sure how trying harder’s going to change anything.』</p>
<p>「Bark!」</p>
<p>『It’s not a matter of how many limbs you use to walk so that’s not going to help either.』</p>
<p>Urushi seemed to be trying to stand on his hind legs as if to demonstrate that he could use his front paws in much the same manner as a human being. His legs were clearly shaking though, so it evidently wasn’t what you’d normally call the best idea.</p>
<p>That said, seeing him act all gung ho really made me want to find him something to do.</p>
<p>Let’s see… he’s much pretty limited to using only his mouth and front paws. The former was much more reliable than the latter, so we’d need something that wouldn’t suffer from him holding it in his mouth all the time.</p>
<p>『Oh, I know. How about helping me make the butter?』</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>『One sec.』</p>
<p>I grabbed a barrel out of the dimensional storage. Inside was freshly squeezed milk, obtained from none other than our friend at the Luciel Conglomerate. The plan was to use it in order to create butter which would then be used for the chicken broth we needed to flavour the spiciest variation. I was originally planning to just use of space/time magic, but this was one of the few things that Urushi could actually do, so might as well leave it up to him instead.</p>
<p>To begin, I had him return to his usual size.</p>
<p>『Hey Urushi, open wide.』</p>
<p>「Bark.」</p>
<p>『Catch.』</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>『Make sure you don’t bite down, alright? The barrel’s made out of wood, so it’ll probably break if you do. 』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>『Alright, you don’t actually need to do anything super complicated. All you have to do is start shaking it as hard as you can and not stop till I tell you to.』</p>
<p>「W-Woof…?」</p>
<p>『Hey, you’re the one who said you wanted to help, so get to work already.』</p>
<p>「W-Woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi obediently started to reproduce the ever so well known phenomenon of violent headbanging in response to my commands. All he had to do was keep that up for an hour, and we’d have butter! Though, he’d also probably be a bit more than just a bit dizzy, but hey, whatever. He asked for it.</p>
<p>And with that, both Fran and Urushi had something to keep them busy, so I went back to working on the spices.</p>
<p>Time flew as we concentrated our assigned tasks; the evening had almost seemed have blindsided us.</p>
<p>Urushi was, as one would expect, no longer able to stand on his feet. He’d been wobbling about in one of the room’s corners ever since he completed his task.</p>
<p>『You guys want to take a break and go check out the Lunar Banquet?』</p>
<p>「Nn. Will visit food stalls.」</p>
<p>『That’s not really what I meant. There’s going to be a parade and stuff. I was thinking we might as well go see what it's all about.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Lots of delicious food.」</p>
<p>『Well, that works too I guess.』</p>
<p>The city had already shifted gears into festival mode. The streets were lined with stalls, and filled to the brim with people.</p>
<p>『Things sure did get lively around here.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Nom nom.」</p>
<p>『Wait a second, you’re eating already!?』</p>
<p>「Nn. Grilled Squid.」[1]</p>
<p>「Crunch crunch.」</p>
<p>『Man, and now Urushi’s even got himself a chunk of bone-in meat? Aren’t you guys being a little <i>too</i> quick about this? It hasn’t even been a minute since we got outside, you know?』</p>
<p>And wait, wasn’t Urushi totally about to collapse because of how dizzy he was just a second ago?</p>
<p>「Heard the call of tasty food.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>I guess stuff like that doesn't matter so long as their stomachs are involved, or something like that.</p>
<p>Fran moved through the street whilst weaving in and out crowd and going back and forth between the two sides. She visited every stall she pleased, and didn't let anything stop her food-filled advance.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for us start to hear the sound of music, and I wasn’t talking Japanese style festival music. It most closely resembled something out of Europe, but seemed to have a bit of an African-ish flavour mixed into it as well.</p>
<p>We started moving towards the sound’s source, and eventually found a five member band playing a performance by the roadside. Their instruments actually looked quite like what I used to seeing back on Earth. That is, the musicians were making use of violin and pipe-like objects to create their melodies.</p>
<p>Enjoying ourselves once again caused time to fly right by, and before we knew it, the sun had vanished below the horizon.</p>
<p>Dusk was promptly followed by a loud cheer from the festival's participants.</p>
<p>『Oh? Looks like something’s happening.』</p>
<p>「Over there. Really big.」</p>
<p>『Looks like a float. Wait, is there someone on top of it?』</p>
<p>「Priestess.」</p>
<p>『Huh, now that you mention it, her clothes do give off that whole sacred type of vibe.』</p>
<p>Appraising her informed me that she was an oracle. Wait, so can she really hear the gods’ voices? If so, then I guess they really do exist, or at least they do in this world anyways.</p>
<p>We wanted to follow the float because they were apparently going to perform a dance for the sake of some sort of ritual, but everyone else seemed to be thinking the same thing, so it ended up getting a bit messy. We ended up more or less being stuck because of all the human traffic, and at this rate, it looked like we'd probably end up missing the ritual altogether.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>『Let’s get ourselves a birds eye view so we don’t have to deal with this anymore.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran slipped out of the crowd and leapt atop a nearby building. She continued to traverse from rooftop to treetop to rooftop whilst skipping ahead of the float. I felt like we were kind of cheating seeing as how everyone else still had to put up with the crowd and all that, hey, might as well use what you got.</p>
<p>Our final destination ended up being on top of a clocktower that oversaw the square in which the ritual was to take place. I had to say, we had a pretty damned good view.</p>
<p>It seemed that our timing had been pretty much spot on. The float turned into the square right as we finished settling ourselves down.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for them to start the ceremony. The shrine maiden began to offer her prayer in the form of a song, to which the crowd immediately responded by quieting down. Soon the square was filled with nothing but the the sounds of the priestess’ voice and the instruments that supported it. This time around, the melody was much more gentle, and seemed to have a bit of a Japanese quality to it.</p>
<p>Six beautiful dancers entered the spotlight as the priestess sang; their silver, shoulder-length hair swayed through the night as they wholeheartedly immersed themselves in their performances.</p>
<p>「Pretty.」</p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but note how practiced and efficient their movements were. It felt as if the dance itself was something usable in battle.</p>

<p>It looked like the dancers all had the War Dancer job. I assumed that the job’s main skill would then be War Dance. Hmm, let’s check a few things out in a bit more detail.</p>
<p><b>War Dance</b>: A martial art that allows one to fight while dancing.</p>
<p><b>War Dance Techniques</b>: A dance that charms onlooking enemies and invigorates one’s allies.</p>
<p><b>Captivating Dancer</b>: Amplifies the effects of aby dance-related skills.</p>
<p>So apparently they can fight at dance at the same time. What’s with all these manga-like abilities that've been showing up lately? I mean, their weapons were literally the metal rings they were wearing on their persons. I honestly can’t say I’m not interested. That looks hella awesome.</p>
<p>Fran pulled out a warm glass of ginger ale as she continued to watch the ritual. She really seemed to have taken a liking to the stuff as of late.</p>
<p>This world’s ginger wasn’t as spicy as the ginger we had back in Japan. It was much sweeter overall, so most people just straight up ate it as a vegetable instead of using it as a spice. I’ve never actually seen anyone cook with it, and apparently, Fran had never even heard of ginger ale or ginger pork before. [2] [3]</p>
<p>「Yum.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Fran’s facial expression relaxed as she leaned onto Urushi and sank into his fur whilst drinking her ginger ale. She was showing a rare, happy smile.</p>
<p>And so, we continued to watch. We watched the singers sing and the dancers dance; we observed the ephemeral scene play out as we overlooked it from what could what could only be described as a VIP seat.</p>
<p>『Looks like it’s over.』<br>
「Nn. Was really pretty.」</p>
<p>That wasn’t a bad show at all. The ritual ceremony was beautiful to behold, and I felt as if it’d really drawn me in. Seeing it made me feel both relaxed and invigorated enough to return to the kitchen and keep up the ever arduous task of preparation.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>[1] Grilled squid is a really common thing at Japanese festivals. They normally roast it over a stove, put on a bit of sauce and then serve to you on a skewer. Tends to look something like this.</p>
<p><img title="" src="https://images2-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=focus&amp;gadget=a&amp;no_expand=1&amp;resize_h=0&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2ftenseiken.files.wordpress.com%2f2017%2f10%2fnull3.png%3fw%3d324%26h%3d200" alt="" width="324" height="200"></p>
<p>[2] Japanese ginger ale is a bit different from its western counterpart in the sense that it tends to be closer to something homemade than the soft drink you buy from the store in the west. You also normally have it warm instead of cold. It’s good for people with stuffy noses apparently. Take this with a grain of salt though, as I’ve actually had it myself. All this is second hand information that indirectly came from a pos slurping a cup of the stuff on the other side of the Earth.</p>
<p><img title="" src="https://images2-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=focus&amp;gadget=a&amp;no_expand=1&amp;resize_h=0&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2ftenseiken.files.wordpress.com%2f2017%2f10%2fnull4.png%3fw%3d580%26h%3d400" alt="" width="580" height="400"></p>
<p>[3] If you go to a Japanese restaurant, you can probably get this. It’s called shogayaki, and it’s one of Japan’s most popular pork-based dishes. I think you can make it with other meat instead, but I s2g that’s blasphemy and you deserve to be hanged for it. It’s pretty good, and basically, you pour a bunch of ginger sauce on top of a bunch of thin pork slices right when you finish frying them. It’s often served with a few greens, and pretty damn good. Oh yeah, it’s basically a rule that you have to eat this with rice. Even if you’re allergic or something, eat it with rice. It’ll be worth it.</p>
<p><img title="" src="https://images2-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=focus&amp;gadget=a&amp;no_expand=1&amp;resize_h=0&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2ftenseiken.files.wordpress.com%2f2017%2f10%2fnull5.png%3fw%3d624%26h%3d417" alt="" width="624" height="417"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Suggestions for the War Dancer job and the War Dance skill are more than welcome. They are apparently real terms in English, but they look weird to me. Maybe it's just me? I'm a foreigner though, so if you guys don't find the terms to be weird at all, then I'mma just blame that.</span></p>
					
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>114. Gestures and Confusion<br>
</b><br>
We headed back to kitchen after watching the festival’s main event come to a conclusion. Naturally, the trip back, like the trip there, was accompanied by Fran purchasing what could only be described as an unnecessary amount of food.</p>
<p>『Alright, I’ve got all my energy back, so I’m about to kick myself into high gear. You guys should probably start getting ready for bed.』</p>
<p><span id="more-377"></span></p>
<p>「It’s fine. Will help.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>『Well, if you’re sure, then I’ll take you up on that offer.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Can count on me.」</p>
<p>「Bark!」</p>
<p>『Sweet. Alright, I guess you can keep working on prepping up the vegetables and stuff then, Fran.』</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>『And as for you Urushi? You’re… also going to be doing the same thing you were before.』</p>
<p>「W-Whimper…」</p>
<p>I handed Urushi another barrel so he could go back to headbanging. Luckily, that would be the last time I needed to have him do it. We needed about six kilograms of butter in total, and the first barrel had managed to produce half of that, so yeah.</p>
<p>Butter was honestly more of a luxury than anything else in the first place. Its market price was way too high for it to be worth it, and to make matters worse, the stuff you could buy didn’t even taste all that great. The butter Urushi made was salt free, fresh, and much more delicious than anything else we could get, so making it ourselves was pretty much resulted in us obtaining a higher quality product for a fraction of the cost. It was one of the ever so desired two birds one stone type situations.</p>
<p>『Do your best. Don’t be giving up on me now.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>The large black wolf ultimately resigned himself to his fate. He lifted the barrel above his head and moved over to room with a bit of a higher ceiling before finally starting to swing his neck up and down with as much vigour as he could muster.</p>
<p>『I guess I’ll get started on the dough next.』</p>
<p>And so, I worked on the task for about two odd hours.</p>
<p>Naturally, both Fran and Urushi needed sleep, so they’d already headed back to the inn. I, on the other hand, was an object, so I used my lack of a need for rest in order to continue working throughout the night.</p>
<p>『Woah, it’s already past midnight.』</p>
<p>I felt the urge to go outside and look upon the night sky. I wanted to stare at all seven gleaming moons as they illuminated my darkened surroundings, just as I’d done on the day I reincarnated. But I couldn’t. We were in the middle of the city, so there was a chance that someone would spot me as I basked in the moonlight. It was a bit of a shame, but I was honestly still quite content just knowing that they were there.</p>
<p>Well, I could’ve easily just created a doppelganger and had it look instead, but that was flat out just a waste of the skill’s cooldown.</p>
<p>Man, I can’t believe I’ve been here for three whole months already. My life back in Japan had been rather stagnant, and time seemed to move at a snail’s pace. Here though, it almost seemed to fly by far too quickly. I guess this is what it means to live out a fulfilling life.</p>
<p>The moment I entertained that thought was the moment everything went back.</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>W-Wait, what the hell just happened!? Why couldn’t I see anymore? Is this some sort of like bug or error? Wait, how <i>did </i>I see in the first place? I had no idea, which meant I also had no idea as to whether or not I was supposed to retain the ability see in the first place. Maybe this is something that’s supposed to happen? Please no.</p>
<p>The darkness was suddenly overridden by its opposite right as my thoughts started strolling down panic lane. Everything around me had suddenly been dyed in a shade of pure white.</p>
<p>It looked like there wasn’t actually any issue with my sense of sight. Whew. Wait, not whew. Where the hell am I? I can’t tell. I looked around, but I was met with the same result regardless of where I cast my gaze. My surroundings seemed to have transformed into an infinite expanse of white. It almost looked like I'd been transported inside the Hyperbolic T*me Chamber or something. Wait, isn’t this like totally what you’d normally see in the first chapter of a novel centered around the theme of reincarnating into another world? Am I about to meet some sort of God so I can reincarnate again or something? Wait, wait, wait, did I just jinx it? I’m pretty sure I did. Fuck! Fuck no! I like this world, I’m not about to let myself get ported over to a different one. I’ve even got unfinished business here. Fran and I are still in the midst of our journey together and I absolutely refuse to leave her side at least until she grows up. I don't care what happens, I won’t budge on that at all, regardless of whether or not I’m speaking to some sort of God.</p>
<p>I panicked a bit more while taking in my surroundings. I couldn’t actually find anything at the first, but someone suddenly rose out of the ground about ten meters in front me right as I came to the conclusion that the place was empty.</p>
<p>His form was exactly like that of a refined middle aged man’s. His shimmering silver hair and laid back robed appearance really served to exemplify the fact that he was in the prime of his life. He looked a bit thin at first glance, but further inspection led me to understand that he was actually jacked as all hell.</p>
<p>The appearance he had really left an impact on me, but despite that, I couldn’t really sense his presence at all. It was like he was some sort of phantom, or a mere illusion. Either way, he didn’t really look like a God. Whew.</p>
<p>I tried to approach him so I could inspect him in a bit more detail, but…</p>
<p>『I can’t move.』</p>
<p>My body had been completely frozen in place, and it didn’t seem like he intended on coming any closer either so I guess that plan was out.</p>
<p>『Who are you?』</p>
<p>The man started to act out a series of gestures instead of answering my question.</p>
<p>『Why do that instead of just talking?』</p>
<p>「――――」</p>
<p>『Huh? I can’t tell what you just said. I couldn’t hear you.』</p>
<p>「――――」</p>
<p>『Oh! Are you perhaps mute?』</p>
<p>Apparently, I’d the nail on the head. The man immediately pointed at me and smiled while nodding, as if to say “spot on.” However, he soon transitioned back into making more gestures. It was evident that he was trying to tell me something.</p>
<p>I started him down as he continued to with his odd gestures. I was having a hard time deciphering them, but I at least managed to grasp that I wasn’t about to be stuck reincarnating again, at least.</p>
<p>Seriously though, what the hell was he trying to tell me? All he kept doing was moving back and forth whilst drawing an upside down triangle.</p>
<p>『Is that supposed to be La Pyramide Inversée?』[1]</p>
<p>「――」</p>
<p>He shook his head in response, so I guess not.</p>
<p>The middle aged man seemed to understand that I found his actions incomprehensible, so he changed them up a bit.</p>
<p>His next course of action was to half open his mouth, raise both hands and slowly walk forward whilst making a sort of a zoned-out expression.</p>
<p>Oh, now that, I understand.</p>
<p>『So it’s something to do with zombies?』</p>
<p>The man responded by giving me two thumbs up.</p>
<p>He then proceeded to alternate between his previous two patterns. That is, he’d start drawing triangles, switch to being a zombie, start drawing triangles again and so on and so forth. Hmmm… zombies, zombies… You know what I think of when I think of zombies? The freaking floating island we were on, that’s what. Wait, is that what he’s going for?</p>

        </div>
        
<p>『Is that upside down triangle you’re drawing supposed to be representing the floating island that one dungeon was on?』</p>
<p>「――」</p>
<p>Sweet, looks like I hit the nail on the head. He responded with another thumbs up.</p>
<p>『Alright, I get that part, what’s next?』</p>
<p>The man took a lowered battled stance with his fists by his hips. He then began to tremble whilst giving off a magic-like glow, as if letting power course throughout the entirety of his body.</p>
<p>『Kaiouk*en?』</p>
<p>「――」</p>
<p>Yeahhhhh, I figured that wasn’t it.</p>
<p>『Wait wait, are you trying to imitate Krill*n?』</p>
<p>「――」</p>
<p>Okay yeah, I figured that one wouldn’t be right either. That said, I honestly couldn’t really see his actions as anything other than him imitating a character straight out Dr*gon Ball or Huntsman X Huntsman.</p>
<p>I hoped he’d change his approach, but didn’t and just kept repeating the exact same action.</p>
<p>『Hmm.. are you trying to say something along the lines of someone using an incredible amount of power?』</p>
<p>He stuck out a hand so it pointed straight towards me before wobbling it from left to right, an obvious indication that I was kind of on the right track, but not really all the way there yet.</p>
<p>『Are you supposed to be… releasing some sort of secret trump card?』</p>
<p>He gave me a point and a nod, so apparently that was the right answer. Let’s see… secret trump card… floating island dungeon…?</p>
<p>『Oh! Latent Potential Release!』</p>
<p>The man gave me an excited thumbs up since I’d finally manage to give him the answer he wanted. Immediately afterwards, he raised his hand to his face and started to flap his fingers as if to imitate a pair of lips.</p>
<p>Something about talking through latent potential release…?</p>
<p>『The lich?』</p>
<p>The man formed an X with his forearms.</p>
<p>『Let’s see… what else fits… The system announcer?』</p>
<p>Wrong again, apparently.</p>
<p>『Oh, wait! I remember now! You must've been the one dude that started talking to me telepathically out of nowhere! I remember you telling me a bunch about the System Announcer.』</p>
<p>It seemed like I’d gotten the answer right? The man responded with a curt nod, but quickly transitioned into a light bow with his hands pressed together in what seemed like an apologetic manner.</p>
<p>He again started going back and forth between a pair of actions. He’d bow and then do the talking motion and then repeat the whole cycle ad infinitum.</p>
<p>Looked to me like he was trying to apologize with regards to something he’d said to me back then… Hmm… What did we talk about anyways…?</p>
<p>『Who are you anyway?』</p>
<p>『Wellll, I was planning on telling you eventually anyways. And I was planning on meeting up with you in about a monthish, something around that, iunno. Well, telepathically meet up that is, if you count that. Buuuuuut, eh, whatever. Might as well tell you now minus all the pretentious nitty gritty junk anyway.』</p>
<p>『You sure sound laid back…』</p>
<p>『Welll, that's cause we don't really count as strangers n stuff anyway. Whatever, whatever. Might as well say it. My name is….』</p>
<p>And that was when our conversation had come to an abrupt end. So if he wanted to apologize for something, it’d probably be because….</p>
<p>『I’m guessing we aren’t able to meet up in person like you’d been planning?』</p>
<p>The man responded with a nod.</p>
<p>『I guess you must’ve run into some sort of blocker or something along the way then?』</p>
<p>A pair of nods.</p>
<p>『And you can’t tell me who you are either?』</p>
<p>A group of three nods.</p>
<p>Ahhh, I get what this whole thing is all about… but why can’t he talk this time? I mean, he did last time.</p>
<p>The man made the power up pose, pointed at himself, and then got on both knees and pretended to wheeze.</p>
<p>『So what I’m getting is that you can’t talk anymore because I used Latent Potential Release?』</p>
<p>Apparently Latent Potential Release had affected this guy the same way it had with the System Announcer.</p>
<p>『Wait, so that means you’re a part of me?』</p>
<p>Nod.</p>
<p>『Are you the guy whose voice I heard right when I reincarnated?』</p>
<p>Nod.</p>
<p>I knew it!</p>
<p>That said, learning this had given rise to a question that I simply couldn’t ignore or set aside for later.</p>
<p>『So… Just who are you then?』</p>
<p>I couldn’t resist asking him that. I was so curious about the answer that I’d almost felt as if it'd been eating away at me.</p>
<p>The man frowned and shook his head from side to side. It didn’t like he was going to be able to answer me.</p>
<p>『Hmm… Are you going to up and vanish too, or are we going to be able to end up being able to meet with each other like this some time in the future as well?』</p>
<p>The man drew one large circle overhead and dotted it with six smaller ones. An easily understood answer.</p>
<p>『The thing you just drew would be the full moon and its six smaller counterparts, right?』</p>
<p>But why only then of all times? Actually, now that I think about it, Latent Potential Release aside, the only time I’d ever spoken to him was when I was first reincarnated exactly three months ago. In other words, the moons had been full back then too</p>
<p>『Can you only appear during the Lunar Banquet or something?』</p>
<p>Apparently I was right.</p>
<p>『So I’m guessing I’ll see you again in three months time?』</p>
<p>The man smiled a shit eating grin whilst energetically raising both thumbs. For some odd reason, the action had seemed to cause him to start to fade away.</p>
<p>『Wait a second! I’m not done asking you stuff!』</p>
<p>My words prompted the man to once again take his apology pose before vanishing altogether. I guess he ran out of time.</p>
<p>The world around me underwent the same thing it had earlier; it faded out into black before going back to normal.</p>
<p>『Seems like I’m back in the kitchen.』</p>
<p>Everything was exactly as it had been just before I faded out. In fact, no time seemed to have passed whatsoever. It was like I’d been momentarily spirited away or something.</p>
<p>『I guess I won’t be able to see him for another three months, but I’ll definitely have a tonne of questions prepped for when I do.』</p>
<p>I wonder if he can hear me right now. I mean, he did claim to be a part of me after all.</p>
<p>[1] It’s an interesting French tourist attraction located in the Louvre. You guys might recognize it if you read western literature / watch western movies, as it’s known for being a part of The Da Vinci Code. Image below.</p>

<p>I was a bit busy this week, so releases weren’t as quick as usual. I’ll be going over to some chick’s house for dinner tomorrow too, so I’m not actually sure if I’ll manage a release before the time I listed in the next chapter thingy. I’ll try though.</p>

		<p><b>115. Visitors</b></p>
<p>The date was April first.</p>
<p>We were greeted by a group of visitors not long after we got up and to work.</p>
<p>「Good morning Miss Fran. I found a few people to fill that salesperson job you mentioned.」</p>
<p><span id="more-392"></span></p>
<p>Colbert had brought with him a group of three female adventurers.</p>
<p>「Hello.」</p>
<p>「Nice to meet you.」</p>
<p>「'Sup」</p>
<p>None of the three seemed to make light of Fran despite her being a child. They all bowed as they greeted her in the manner an adventurer normally would when associating with an employer.</p>
<p>「These guys are all a part of The Scarlet Maidens, a D ranked party.」</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Adventurer ranks could be sorted into one of two types, individual ranks and party ranks. Fran ran solo, so she only had the first type, which as one could expect from its name, was solely based on her own abilities.</p>
<p>Party ranks, on the other hand, were based on the group’s overall combat potential. D ranked parties, for example, mainly consisted of adventurers with individual ranks in the E to F range.</p>
<p>As with the case with individual ranks, party ranks were assigned by the guild. They’d look at each member’s individual ranks alongside their functions and the party’s overall balance before assigning the most appropriate letter grade.</p>
<p>The party is often ranked higher than the individual members within it, but that isn’t necessarily always the case. An example of this would be the one Cruz guy we did that joint operation with back in Alessa. All three of his party’s members were ranked C, but the party wasn’t given promoted to B because they didn’t exactly qualify for the next tier up. In other words, three fully fledged C ranked individuals were still considered weaker than a single B ranker.</p>
<p>Kladd, the spiky haired dude that led Dragon’s Roar, was in a situation that was both a bit similar but also completely different at the same time. He and his party were both classified as E rank despite the latter having five members in total. His party was denied promotion for a multitude of different factors. The first was that the other four members were all ranked F, and the second was that none of its members used anything but spears. Honestly, if that was all it was, then the guild probably wouldn’t have minded ranking his party up, but there was also the whole thing about him having a bad attitude.</p>
<p>Normally, you'd think that someone that went solo would be stronger than a party given that they shared the same rank, but that often wasn’t the case at all. Each member of a party had their own individual strengths. Putting those together alongside the element of teamwork could allow the party to have better performance than a single more powerful individual.</p>
<p>The Scarlet Maidens seemed like a pretty good party at first glance. They were pretty well balanced in the sense that they had both a vanguard and rearguard. Moreover, they apparently also had a pretty good reputation, so they, unlike Kladd were allowed to rank up to D.</p>
<p>One interesting factor was that all three of their members had skills that related to either math or business, which was honestly pretty rare amongst adventurers.</p>
<p>「I’m Judith, the party’s leader.」</p>
<p>A girl with long, blue hair approached Fran and extended her hand out for a shake.</p>
<p>「I have a decent amount of sales experience. My father was a peddler, and often took me with him to work during my childhood. I have both the cooking and commerce skills.」</p>
<p>I see, so I guess that means it’s possible to pick up a skill by watching someone else use it for an extended amount of time. She probably got her cooking skill because she’d go on journeys with said father. I didn't really see any reason not to hire her, especially given that she was both beautiful and polite.</p>
<p>「My name is Maia. I’m in charge of most of the party’s chores.」</p>
<p>The next person to speak was a redhead with a bob cut. The fact that she spoke at a relatively slow pace seemed to contradict the fact that her skills were mostly thief-like. Apparently, she took care of all the party’s cooking and prep work. She’d even polish everyone’s armour. Her skills more or less indicated that she was a veritable jack of all trades. She had Cooking, Negotiation, and even Arithmetic. She was also fairly pretty, so I once again saw no reason not to hire her.</p>
<p>「Lydia.」</p>
<p>The last of the three girls seemed resemble Fran a bit. She was relatively young, wore a white robe, had black hair, and seemed not to change her expression when she spoke. The only thing that really differentiated her from Fran was the fact that her hair went all the way down to her waist. And of course there was also the fact that she wasn’t nearly as cute as Fran was, but that was just a given.</p>
<p>One her skills really caught my eye. Magic Circle allowed her to engrave a spell onto a piece of paper or something for later activation, possibly in the form of a trap. It looked really interesting. I really wanted to get my hands on it.</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>Lydia and Fran stared each other down for a bit, but neither had even the slightest change of expression.</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>The atmosphere ended up getting all awkward until Fran decided to give her head a bit of a tilt.</p>
<p>「…I lost!」</p>
<p>Lydia suddenly dropped onto all fours whilst hanging her head in shame.</p>
<p>「What the! What in the world are you doing, Lydia?」</p>
<p>Judith seemed to be surprised at her companion’s sudden action.</p>
<p>「I lost. The whole expressionless personality I had going was just a facade, but her? She’s the real deal.」</p>
<p>「I see…」</p>
<p>「If the rumours are true, then she’s got me completely outclassed. She’s already a master swordsman, and can apparently even use flame magic despite being younger than me.」</p>
<p>Huh… So they know that much about her? I guess she’s quite a bit more famous than I’d anticipated. Is that a good thing though…? I honestly can’t tell…</p>
<p>「I’m nothing but a downgrade. The only thing I have over her is the length of my hair.」</p>
<p>「Y-You’re taller than her too.」</p>
<p>「That’s something that’ll probably change the moment she goes through puberty.」</p>
<p>「B-But you have The God of Wisdom's Divine Protection. That should at least let you stand out a bit, right?」</p>
<p>Divine protection from the God of Wisdom made it easier to level up skills related to the accumulation of knowledge, which, to adventurers, was pretty god damn useful.</p>
<p>The party's leader was already working hard. She had to explain the skill to Fran whilst praising Lydia and helping her to her feet.</p>
<p>「I have to be able to use Arithmetic in order to draw magic circles, so I can help with anything involving math. I can’t cook, but I have the Mixing skill, so feel free to leave any compounding-related tasks to me!」</p>
<p>「A-Anyways, we’ll do our best if your willing to hire us.」</p>
<p>「We really will!」</p>
<p>They didn’t seem to be lying about doing their best, and they’ve even got Colbert backing them, so I’d say I don’t really have any reason to refuse.</p>
<p>We negotiated with them a bit before arriving a final fee of five thousand Golde per person plus free meals for all three days. I’d thought it was actually a bit on the low side, but they seemed to find it decent given that the job was pretty much completely devoid of danger. My sense of monetary value seemed to be a bit off given that Fran and I often dispatched magic beasts with ranks far higher than our own.</p>
<p>Moreover, they were actually more interested in the free food than they were the Golde. It seemed that the only reason they wanted the job in the first place was because of how much Colbert had hyped up my cooking, which in turn really made me wonder if all his acquaintances happened to be foodies or something like that. Oh well, either way, they’re willing to put in the effort, so whatever works, I guess.</p>
<p>Colbert leered at the three girls with a look of envy.</p>
<p>「I-I know that all you don’t need anymore salespeople, but do you have any other sort of vacancy?」</p>
<p>The tuna lover interjected with a bit of a nervous tone.</p>
<p>Hmm… let’s see… I can’t think of anything in particular…</p>
<p>「I’d really just like to help out, so you don’t even need to pay me. A-As long as you cover my meals.」</p>
<p>Okay, honestly, that was pretty worth. A B ranked adventurer was offering to help us for nothing but free meals as compensation. I didn't really see any reason not to keep him around just so he can handle whatever happens to pop up.</p>
<p>「Got it. Will hire. Responsible for handling all miscellaneous tasks.」</p>
<p>「R-Really? Hell yeah!」</p>
<p>「We three also look forward to working for you!」</p>
<p>And so, we managed to get ourselves a group of three salesgirls alongside someone to handle pretty much everything else.</p>
<p>We were almost done all our preparations too.</p>
<p>I’d already long finished making everything; the dough and filling were all completely prepped and ready to go. All that was left for us was put it together by wrapping the latter in the former and frying it. It sounded like there was very little left to do, but the final steps were actually quite tiring and time consuming in and of themselves.</p>
<p>Fran literally had the attention span of a cat, so I pretty much ended up having to do it all myself.</p>
<p>That said, she obviously wasn’t just sitting around and wasting time until I finished. She and Urushi were actually in the midst of a bit of some indoor training. They couldn’t actually mess everything up by going all out, so instead, they focused on manipulating their magical energies in order to draw a series of three dimensional images. The nature of the exercise made it look more like they were playing around than training, and honestly, knowing Fran, I’d say she probably wasn’t even actually trying to train. She’d likely decided to do the exercise because she thought it was fun. Seeing the two of them like that almost made me feel the urge put out a few snacks for them or something.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>I was about to grab her some milk and cookies, but ended up stopping because I suddenly felt a bunch of people approach the building we were in. Fran and Urushi seemed to have felt it as well, as both stopped what they were doing and instead started to focus their attention on examining our surroundings.</p>
<p>『Looks like we’ve got ourselves a few guests.』</p>
<p>And uninvited ones, at that. There were actually two distinct parties. The first had several people in it. Its members had tried to hide themselves whilst surrounding the building and slowly sneaking closer and closer towards us. The other consisted only of a single person. Said single person was approaching the building in a much more natural manner.</p>
<p>「Detain them?」</p>
<p>『Hmm.. I’d say we hold off a bit. We can’t actually be sure that they’re here to harm us.』</p>
<p>We’ve no idea what they’re after. The party of one was approaching via the back door, so I decided to have Fran check what he was up to before making any moves?</p>
<p>I was thinking that he was going to do something suspicious, but he actually just ended up giving the door a knock.</p>
<p>「Who?」</p>
<p>Fran called out to the person whilst readying herself for whatever was to come.</p>
<p>「I know it’s a bit late, but I was hoping to ask a favour.」</p>
<p>「Favour?」</p>
<p>「Yes. I was hoping that you would be willing to hear me out about something.」</p>
<p>I was a bit curious as to what was going to happen, so I took a quick glance out the door’s peephole.</p>
<p>The dude standing outside looked like your typical textbook merchant. He didn’t even bear the slightest resemblance to the dirty sleazeball he really was. That is, appraising him informed me that he was a total scumbag.</p>
<p>His job was Swindler, and he had both the Intimidation and Falsehood skills. Yup, he was definitely as guilty as could be. He wasn’t all that strong or anything like that, but his skillset made it so that I’d probably end up saying yes if anyone was to ask me whether or not I found him difficult to deal with..</p>
<p>「What?」</p>
<p>「I would very much prefer if you let me inside.」</p>
<p>「Can’t tell me now?」</p>
<p>「I’d really like to discuss the topic at length if possible.」</p>
<p>I went over to the window and began peering outside as Fran continued to question the man. His supposed companions were hiding themselves within the night, but I managed to find them regardless. I had both presence detection and night vision, so I more or less saw them as clearly as I would've during the day.</p>
<p>The conclusion? They were pretty much all just small fry. Our enemies were comprised of a group of burglars alongside a single Lv 25 assassin.</p>
<p>In other words, our assailants were villains that the world would be better off without. I was more or less already completely sure of the fact that they wanted to attack us. In fact, they were technically already in the process of doing so given that they were trying their best to surround the place. We could probably already claim self defense even if we jumped into the crowd and busted them all up before letting them actually try something. We didn’t even need to keep them around seeing as how the swindler dude could probably tell us everything we wanted to know.</p>
<p>『We’d probably end up with a mess on our hands if we let him get away.』</p>
<p>And so, I decided to just casually start by getting rid of the people surrounding us.</p>
<p>『Fran, let him in so he can’t get away. I’ll dispose of all his companions in the meantime.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>「Thank you very much for your understanding!」</p>
<p>「Come in.」</p>
<p>「Don’t mind if I do.」</p>
<p>Urushi circled around the swindler and blocked off the exit the moment after he stepped through it. The wolf was currently in his mini mode, so he didn’t look nearly as intimidating. Even so, the swindler basically had no capacity for combat, so seeing the “dog” seemed to worry him a bit. Naturally, he didn’t go as far as to react by changing his expression, but I did catch him throwing Urushi a quick sidelong glance.</p>
<p>「Hahaha, that’s a cute little doggy you have there.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran promptly locked the door as she responded in order to pressure the swindler even further.</p>
<p>I, on the other hand left the building before he so much as had the chance to see me. I used Short Jump to instantly teleport behind the assassin. I then cast Silence, lopped his head off and shoved his corpse inside the dimensional storage. The whole thing had gone much more smoothly than I’d initially anticipated. He had Crisis Detection, so I figured he might be able to react to me, but I managed to dispose of him before the skill even went off.</p>
<p>I picked up the pace and began to repeat my prior actions. I had to be quick about it. The burglars had presence detection, so they would eventually realize that their allies were being picked off.</p>
<p>However, in the end, weaklings were weakings. Four of six assailants died before any of them even noticed that something was off. The last two didn’t seem to have the capacity to immediately figure out what to do, so they too soon fell to my blade.</p>
<p>After finishing them all off, I teleported back into the building. Specifically, I ended up choosing to go to where the storefront was in order to avoid being seen by the swindler.</p>
<p>「—is what I would like to procure.」</p>
<p>My timing turned out to be pretty good. The swindler had just so happened to start getting down to business to moment I went back inside.</p>
<p>「Potion box?」</p>
<p>「Yes. I would like to procure from you the potion box you picked up at the pirate’s hideout.」</p>
<p>「What?」</p>
<p>「There’s no point in feigning ignorance. I’ve already had the matter investigated. Would you mind selling it to me for ten thousand Golde?」</p>
<p>Oh come on dude. Aren’t you being a little <i>too</i> stingy? There was over a million Golde’s worth of stuff in there you know? And you’re trying to get it for just ten thousand? Seriously? Come on…</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell if he was looking down on her or just planning to get his hands on the thing through some sort of less than decent method.</p>
<p>Given that he had his subordinates surround the building, I’d say it was more likely than not the latter.</p>
<p>「Don’t know what you’re talking about.」</p>
<p>「As I said just a few moments earlier, I’ve already had the matter investigated, and so, there is no point feigning ignorance.」</p>
<p>「No idea what you’re talking about.」</p>
<p>「Sigh… how obstinate. Taking the offer would have been to your benefit.」</p>
<p>The atmosphere around the man suddenly changed from that of a merchant to a much more intimidating air as he activated his skill.</p>
<p>「Refuse to talk anymore. Leave.」</p>
<p>「I won’t be leaving without the potion box.」</p>
<p>He’s pretty much kicked Intimidation into full throttle. Any normal girl would’ve already been scared out of her wits by now.</p>
<p>「Already said don’t know what you’re talking about. Mentally deficient?」</p>
<p>「Don’t get cocky now, little girl… You’re just a D ranked adventurer. You won’t get away with just a few scratches if you dare disobey us.」</p>
<p>The man merchant like mask finally shattered in its entirety.</p>
<p>「That’s my line. Mere swindler. Shouldn’t be cocky.」</p>
<p>「I’ll make you regret those words, girl!」</p>
<p>The man turned towards the exit whilst making his declaration. He was probably going to go order his subordinates to attack, but it obviously wasn’t going to happen. The card he was trying to play was the one he’d thrown away the moment he entered the building.</p>
<p>「Growl.」</p>
<p>「Oi, what’re you trying to pull here?」</p>
<p>「No escaping. Won’t let you get away.」</p>
<p>「Did you really think that my subordinates would just sit there if I didn’t end up returning to them?」</p>
<p>「Will allow you to call them. Try it.」</p>
<p>「Very well then! Hey! It’s time for work you bastards!」</p>
<p>He shouted incredibly loudly. His subordinates definitely would’ve heard him had they still been alive. It went without saying that he assumed they were, so he ending up standing there for a few moments whilst awaiting their arrival.</p>
<p>He waited and waited, but not a single one responded to his calls.</p>
<p>「W-Why aren’t they…」</p>
<p>「Men outside dealt with. By Master.」</p>
<p>「Impossible! You had a companion!? That wasn’t in the reports at all!」</p>
<p>We then used lightning magic in order to paralyze the swindler before tying him up and getting ready to make him tell us everything we wanted to know. It’d normally be pretty difficult to actually get information out of anyone with the Falsehood skill, but I just so happened to have the ability to render it completely invalid through the Principle of Falsehood.</p>
<p>「What are you planning?」</p>
<p>「Information. From where?」</p>
<p>「Why would I t-zzaazzjhakjazyhuazza!」</p>
<p>Fran gave sent a weak electric shock running through the man’s body, which in turn caused him to scream and convulse for a few seconds. This time around, we’d decided to go with a mix of electricity and Fran’s bare hands because I didn’t really want to have the kitchen all covered with blood.</p>
<p>「Haa…. Haa….」</p>
<p>「Will ask again. Information about me. From where?」</p>
<p>「How would I k- zjlkahkjdfhjksdhfjkzzzzz!」</p>
<p>Fran made the shock last a few seconds longer this time around. She once again repeated the question, whilst also grinding one of his hands into the ground with her feet.</p>
<p>It took about an hour to get him to crack, but we did manage to get the now haggard looking, teary eye man to divulge everything he knew. Unfortunately, the process that led us there ended up getting his tears and drool all over the floor. Yeahhhh, I’ll probably have to clean that up later.</p>
<p>「To confirm. Working for alchemists?」</p>
<p>「Y-Yes ma’am.」</p>
<p>Long story short, he was hired by an alchemist that went by the name Zerais. Apparently, said alchemist was a rogue that’d been expelled from the guild as a result of some sort of violation. He was currently working on illegal research, and was being funded by some sort of outside sponsor.</p>
<p>The potion box we’d picked up was originally something that Zerais had ordered. It ended up getting lost in shipment as a result of the pirates we’d “become friends” a few days back. Zerais was desperately looking for the potions within said box because they were extremely difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>We asked the swindler about Zerais’ precise location, but it turned out that he didn’t know about it because he wasn’t exactly what you’d call high up the chain. Someone else had ordered him to do this, and that was all. Luckily, we did at least manage to get him to tell us where one of his organisation’s bases of operation was.</p>
<p>Turned out it was the place Urushi had followed the hoodlum back to.</p>
<p>Huh, what’s up with that?</p>
<p>So the mansion or whatever was probably related to Barbra’s lord in some way. In other words, the building and whoever owned it had their feet dipped in both the world of stealing recipes from orphanages and the world of rogue alchemists Like, what the actual hell?</p>
<p>We’re going to need a bit more info before we can actually figure everything out. I really wanted to just break into the building, but that was pretty risky given that the residence was more likely than not ultimately related to some sort of noble.</p>
<p>「T-That’s everything I know! I swear it!」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「P-Please, just let me go…」</p>
<p>Yeah no. That’s not happening.</p>
<p>I quickly put telekinesis to use and gave the man’s neck a good old one eighty degree twist.</p>
<p>『Welp. Looks like this whole thing’s just turned into one big ass troublesome mess.』</p>

		<p><b>116. Kranzel’s Three Great Festivals</b></p>
<p>「To reiterate, the contest will begin at noon. All participants will be allowed to depart the guild at ten in the morning. You’ve two hours to find and push your cart to a location of choice anywhere within the portside, market, or residential areas. However, be warned that you will be dismissed if you attempt to use another individual’s property without prior consent. Please do not set up without first consulting all relevant individuals. Please also wait until noon to start selling your products. Anyone that starts selling their goods before noon will be instantly disqualified, so please make sure you abide by the competition’s rules.」[1]</p>
<p><span id="more-404"></span></p>
<p>The second round’s participants immediately dispersed and began heading towards their respective destinations. We’d originally planned for Urushi to drag our stall along, but a bit of further consideration led us to realize that such an act would ultimately make us stand out, and not in a good way either. So instead, we ended up having our newly employed helper do it for us.</p>
<p>I have to say. Hiring Colbert? Really solid decision right there.</p>
<p>I know I made it sound like cart pushing was all he was good for, but that wasn’t the case at all. He’d actually given us a pretty decent suggestion, a suggestion that ultimately actualized itself in Fran and the salesgirls all wearing matching maid uniforms.</p>
<p>「The curry bread we had for dinner last night was absolutely delicious. However, I can’t say for sure if that alone will be able to carry us all the way through to the finals.」</p>
<p>Colbert commented as he gazed upon our surroundings.</p>
<p>Each and every shop seemed to have its own selection of beautiful clerks. Though, I guess I should've expected that to be the case from the very start. The fact that pretty girls led to more sales was a universal truth, a fundamental axiom that simply couldn’t be overturned regardless of what world one was in.</p>
<p>Cuteness simply wasn’t something that could be defended against, but you know what, cute is justice, so whatever.</p>
<p>「Colbert and I have been thinking over how to optimize our sales, so don’t you worry Fran! You’ll be cruising right through the second round!」</p>
<p>「I’ll do my best too!」</p>
<p>「And I’ll use my charms to attract as many male customers as I can!」</p>
<p>Luckily, it looked like like all three of our salesgirls were pretty much ready to go full steam ahead. They’d been quite shocked at how the curry bread and rice I fed them last night tasted, so telling them that I’d feed them even more extravagant meals if we made it into the finals seemed to have fueled them up all the way.</p>
<p>A large group of people started to tail us as we headed towards our final destination. At first, I’d assumed that they were up to good, but they actually turned out to be customers. Apparently, following the stalls around and camping out around them till they opened was actually a thing.</p>
<p>The number of people trailing behind us gradually grew as we continued to move. Travelling around caused us to end up with about fifty followers, which apparently was actually a pretty low headcount. Some of the more popular participants had about two hundred odd people following them around already.</p>
<p>Crap. I think I might not have taken this whole thing as seriously as I should’ve.</p>
<p>「Lots of people.」</p>
<p>「Hahaha. They don’t call this one of Kranzel’s Three Great Festivals for nothing. The Spring Lunar Banquet features the King of Cooking, The Orison Rite, and the Minstrel’s Contest, amongst many other events, so it draws in folks from all across the land. In fact, I'd say you’ve yet to see anything but a drop in the bucket.」</p>
<p>「Three Great Festivals? Others are?」</p>
<p>Fran tilted her head as she questioned one of Colbert's statements.</p>
<p>「The other two would be Ulmut’s Dungeon Fiesta and the Royal Capital’s New Year’s Festival.」</p>
<p>「Though, I don't really think the New Year’s Festival isn’t actually too different from the Lunar Banquet hosted here in Barbra.」</p>
<p>Apparently the only real difference between the New Year’s Festival and the Lunar Banquet was the fact that the King would give an address each time the former was celebrated. Both contained an enactment of The Orison Rite, and both featured stalls lining the streets with food for purchase. It wasn’t all that difficult to for me to picture it. The Dungeon Fiesta, on the other hand, had led me draw nothing but a blank.</p>
<p>「The Dungeon Fiesta is a festival meant for adventurers so they can engage in blood splattering, flesh tearing, bone crushing practices.」</p>
<p>The hell? All I can really say at this point is that it sounds violent and barbaric as all hell.</p>
<p>「Lydia’s more or less hit the nail on the head there. The fiesta does tend to get a bit wild.」</p>
<p>「Types of activities?」</p>
<p>「Well, although it’s a fiesta in name, it's actually something moreso along the lines of a martial arts tournament.」</p>
<p>「And it even takes place in Kranzel’s most adventurer-populated city, so you know it’s gotta be good.」</p>
<p>「They’ve got three different categories. The first is one for people under level twenty, and the second for parties of at least size three. The last category doesn’t have any restrictions on its potential participants.」</p>
<p>Huh, a martial arts tournament? That sounds fun. It’d be worth checking out even if we didn’t end up participating ourselves.</p>
<p>「Takes place when?」</p>
<p>「It happens at the end of April, so it’ll start in about a month or so. Just in case you were wondering, the festival is actually held in commemoration of the dungeon’s capture.」</p>
<p>Sweet, the timing more or less works perfectly for us too. Ulmut was going to end up being our next destination anyways.</p>
<p>The conversation we had with Colbert and the girls extended all the way until we reached the place in which we’d been planning to set up.</p>
<p>「Okay. It looks like we’re here.」</p>
<p>It'd come time to focus on the contest.</p>
<p>We’d already accrued a queue of about a hundred people, but much to my surprise, not a single one of them requested that we open shop before noon.</p>
<p>The place we’d ultimately chosen was the large square in which the Chef’s Guild was situated. To be a bit more specific, we set up just in front of the giant clocktower that marked the square’s most northern point. We figured that this was pretty much the best possible place. We could attract customers because it had heavy traffic, and there was actually even enough room for everyone to line up and stuff.</p>
<p>The moment we settled down was the moment we got to work. Fran immediately pulled a batch of curry bread out from within her dimensional storage box and put it on display. She then hung a sign declaring our prices, fired up the stove, and placed a large pot of oil atop it.</p>
<p>「That’s an excellent choice as far as display and advertising goes. Did you think of it yourself, Miss Fran?」</p>
<p>「Master did.」</p>
<p>「Ah, I should’ve expected as much from the Master. He sure does have quite the diverse set of skills.」</p>
<p>The next thing Fran pulled out of storage caused our employees, or more specifically our salesgirls, to only elevate their praises.</p>
<p>「Wow! I’ve seen a few merchants carrying things like those, but never before have I ever seen any so large. They even looks like they're compatible with every single kind of coin. Were they something designed specifically for use at a stall?」</p>
<p>The items in question were a group of three wooden coin counters. They weren’t really anything all that fancy or special, at least by my standards. All I did was use wood in order to reproduce something I remember seeing back in Japan, but apparently the girls thought them to be innovative. [2]</p>
<p>「Nn. Exactly.」</p>
<p>「The magic sword girl’s master sure does seem versatile.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Master. Amazing.」</p>
<p>Judith, was a merchant’s daughter, so she was able to familiarize herself with the coin counter almost immediately.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>In fact, it didn’t look like any of our three salesgirls had any trouble learning to use the tool, which was good. Effectively employment of the coin counter would allow them to work much more efficiently than they would’ve been able to otherwise. In other words, the coin counters would facilitate that whole selling en masse strategy I had going.</p>
<p>We had everyone head off to the side for lunch after we finished setting up. We decided to eat a little bit earlier because we had no idea how busy things would be getting. There was a pretty decent change that we’d end up having to work nonstop for the next few hours.</p>
<p>「Now, lunch.」</p>
<p>「You have no idea how long I’ve been awaiting this!」</p>
<p>「Same here. You could very well say that we only accepted this request for the food’s sake.」</p>
<p>「Don’t forget about breakfast! It was absolutely splendid.」</p>
<p>「Them egg salad sandwiches… Hnnnngg.」</p>
<p>Apparently everyone really liked the egg salad sandwiches I’d randomly whipped up for breakfast, so I decided to stick to the whole sandwich theme for lunch too. Specifically, I ended up having four different types: egg, roast pork, chicken teriyaki, and tuna fillet. [3]</p>
<p>「Swooo goooooddd!!!」</p>
<p>「Hey! I saw that Lydia! Stop trying to hog everything! You too Fran!」</p>
<p>「Heh heh heh…」</p>
<p>「Survival of fittest.」</p>
<p>「I’ll be taking this then.」</p>
<p>「Oh come on! Not you too Maia!」</p>
<p>「Wow! This juice has got quite some flavour to it!」</p>
<p>Our so called picnic lunch ended devolving into something along the lines of a skirmish as all five people fumbled around to get their hands on as many sandwiches as they could. I figured that the fifty I made would be more than enough, but apparently I ended up being about as wrong as wrong could be. The sandwiches had almost seemed to perform a vanishing act; they all disappeared in a matter of moments. If anything, it kind of ended up looking like I didn't make nearly enough to satisfy everyone present.</p>
<p>The salesgirls didn’t seem to be all that happy with each other, and they ended up in a bit of a squabble. Hopefully they’d be able to get back to normal by the time they had to get to work.</p>
<p>One thing to note was that the Chef’s Guild actually had a staff member watching over each establishment in order to ensure that no one cheated. That is, they would also be responsible for aggregating sales numbers and ensuring that everyone used the exact materials that they’d prepared before hand and nothing more. You’d be disqualified the moment you tried to bribe or trick one of the aforementioned staff spectators.</p>
<p>We figured that they'd end up pretty hungry and exhausted at the end of the day, so we tried offering them a few sandwiches, but they ultimately ended up refusing even those.</p>
<p>「I really have to say that the meal before is delicious, but I think the item we’re going to be selling are actually even better.」</p>
<p>「I know right? We’d actually considered buying ourselves some a few portions even though we just had lunch.」</p>
<p>Colbert and Lydia purposefully raised their voices so that the people spectating us could hear them. Apparently, it worked, as a few onlookers actually ended up running over and joining the line. Said queue was already well over a hundred people long. It looked like we were going to have one hell of a busy afternoon.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>[1] I just realized I never explained this, but I’ve been using carts/stalls/booths interchangeably because they’re like these mobile food stalls people pull out for festivals. Think the people who sell hot dogs in major cities.</p>

<p>[2] Think super bootleg cash registers.</p>
<p><img title="" src="https://images2-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=focus&amp;gadget=a&amp;no_expand=1&amp;resize_h=0&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2ftenseiken.files.wordpress.com%2f2017%2f10%2fnull8.png%3fw%3d624%26h%3d624" alt="" width="624" height="624"></p>
<p>[3] For some odd reason, Japanese people love taking dishes that typically go well with rice and shoving them between two pieces of bread. Now, note that they don't use the same white bread you'd typically find in the west, but rather something a bit more buttery and fluffy. If you have any Mitsuwa Marketplaces near you, you might be able to find JP sandwich bread at the bread stores often contained therewithin.</p>
<p>Tamagosando (Egg salad sandwich) is filled with a JP style egg salad. That is, it's basically made up of salt, pepper, sugar, and mayonnaise with a much greater focus on mayo than I'd consider healthy. Note that the mayo is specifically Japanese mayo. The difference between Japanese mayo and American mayo is that the former is typically sweeter and typically isn't made with egg whites.</p>
<p>The sandwiches themselves don't really contain anything but the egg salad, whereas the western counterpart seems to include various condiments as well.</p>
<p><img title="" src="https://images2-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=focus&amp;gadget=a&amp;no_expand=1&amp;resize_h=0&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2ftenseiken.files.wordpress.com%2f2017%2f10%2fnull9.png%3fw%3d580%26h%3d436" alt="" width="580" height="436"></p>
<p>Yakibuta (roast pork) is literally Chinese Char Siu. I have yet to have any decent Char Siu in the USA, but I've had my fair share of it in Canada. Shout out to anyone in the Toronto area, cause it's super good there.</p>
<p><img title="" src="https://images2-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=focus&amp;gadget=a&amp;no_expand=1&amp;resize_h=0&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2ftenseiken.files.wordpress.com%2f2017%2f10%2fnull10.png%3fw%3d624%26h%3d416" alt="" width="624" height="416"></p>
<p>The sandwiches tend to contain eggs and vegis as well.</p>
<p><img title="" src="https://images2-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=focus&amp;gadget=a&amp;no_expand=1&amp;resize_h=0&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2ftenseiken.files.wordpress.com%2f2017%2f10%2fnull11.png%3fw%3d349%26h%3d248" alt="" width="349" height="248"></p>
<p>Chicken teriyaki sandwich… do I really need to explain this one? If you don't know what it is,feel free to comment, but at this point in time, I feel that Chicken Teriyaki is so widespread that basically everyone knows what it is.</p>
<p><img title="" src="https://images2-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=focus&amp;gadget=a&amp;no_expand=1&amp;resize_h=0&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2ftenseiken.files.wordpress.com%2f2017%2f10%2fnull12.png%3fw%3d304%26h%3d220" alt="" width="304" height="220"></p>
<p>The last type of sandwich they mentioned in this chapter was magurokatsusando, or tuna cutlet sandwiches if you don't speak moon rune. They take fish fillet and make it like they would tonkatsu before shoving between two pieces of bread. That is, they cover it in flour, eggs, and then Japanese breadcrumbs before deep frying it in a pan. Typically contains some vegetables, but there's like a billion recipes for this stuff because of how widespread it is.</p>
<p><img title="" src="https://images2-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=focus&amp;gadget=a&amp;no_expand=1&amp;resize_h=0&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2ftenseiken.files.wordpress.com%2f2017%2f10%2fnull13.png%3fw%3d552%26h%3d414" alt="" width="552" height="414"></p>
<p>So just to add a bit of clarity, Colbert = talks with respect, and a very slight bit of refinement. Judith = more casual. Lydia = most casual. Maia = the rest. Japanese doesn't use "X said, Y said." I figured it was fairly obvious as to who was talking most of the time, so I haven't been adding the "x said, y said," in all that often, but if you guys are getting confused, feel free to ask for more clarity and I'll drop a few extra lines in going forward.</p>

		<p><b>117. The First Day’s End</b></p>
<p>「So just to confirm, three milds and two mediums. Is that right?」</p>
<p>「I’d like four hots!」</p>
<p>「Okay, that’ll come to a total of thirty Golde.」</p>
<p>Series upon series of different transactions continued to occur. It was already three in the afternoon, but we were still completely swamped with customers. The line leading up to our store never seemed to drop below a headcount of a hundred, and we had to use the dimensional storage to replenish our stock twice already.</p>
<p><span id="more-419"></span></p>
<p>The two non-salespeople, Fran and Colbert, were respectively responsible for frying up the food and ensuring that the line stayed organised.</p>
<p>「Each piece of curry bread will cost you ten Golde. The mild flavour is suitable for children and any other individuals unable to tolerate strong spices. The medium flavour is for those of you that enjoy that extra little kick. The spicy flavour is so incredibly hot that it’ll make you spit flames!」</p>
<p>Colbert told our customers more about our products as they stood in line, and in doing so, got them to think about their orders ahead of time. His efforts helped to ensure that everything at the cash register went smoothly as could be.</p>
<p>According to Judith, at least half our customers ended up arriving a decision before hitting the front of the line. Unfortunately, the statistic also meant that not everyone was able order the moment their turn came. Normally, you’d think that to be a bad thing, but apparently many of those people had only been convinced to come check out our goods because the line here was actually relatively short, which was a good thing seeing as how it meant we were able to steal customers from the competition.</p>
<p>「Purchasing our goods will serve to benefit your health! Our establishment uses the ever so scarce resource of magic-infused water in all our operations! Don’t miss this chance! Get your serving here and now before it’s all gone! I repeat, Recovery Water is right at your fingertips!」</p>
<p>Apparently, magic-infused water was actually considered a luxury good amongst the general populace, so Colbert advertising our use of it actually managed to pull in quite a decent number of customers.</p>
<p>I would’ve loved for things to keep going as well as they had, but fate wasn’t exactly what you’d call kind.</p>
<p>「The fuck is this shit? You supposed to be sellin garbage?」</p>
<p>「Bitch, you call this bread? Looks like trash to me. The hell is wrong wit chu, chargin people for trash? Y’all fucked up and crazy.」</p>
<p>Our stall ended up getting approached by a group of mohawked dudes, their bodies adorned with unfantasy-like, metal-studded leather jackets.</p>
<p>Gross.</p>
<p>I could tell what was going on at a glance. They were obviously just an unruly bunch hired by one of our competitors. This was further evidenced by what I saw upon taking a quick peek at their stats. They were incredibly weak. I mean, I guess you could sic them on a normal person, or like the average chef or something because of how they looked, but they were honestly far too pathetic to do anything to an adventurer, let alone a whole group of them.</p>
<p>「Come on, hurry it up. Get the fuck outta here with yo dirty ass shitpile merchandise.」</p>
<p>「Yee, probably tastes like fucking garbage anyway. Shit’s so ugly that looking at is enough ta make me want ta vomit. Shieeeeet.」</p>
<p>「Hurry it up, get a move on. You know what, yer asses be slow as hell. We’ll fuckin move you ourselves!」</p>
<p>The disgustingly dressed men pulled out a series of club-like weapons as they approached, an action that immediately caused our customers to start screaming in panic.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t so much as manage the slightest act before they collapsed.</p>
<p>Fran was supposed to have been cooking, but she somehow managed to end up behind them. I didn’t actually know when she first moved to strike them, but if I had to guess, I’d say it was probably right after they insulted curry bread.</p>
<p>All four men had been deprived of their ability to move; they’d been left paralyzed by a series of electric shocks.</p>
<p>I wanted to get right back to selling stuff, but I also kind of wanted to try getting some information out of them too.</p>
<p>『You can leave the follow up to me and just focus on getting back to work, Fran.』</p>
<p>（Nn. Got it.）</p>
<p>『Urushi, go grab one of them.』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>I used Stone Wall to make sure no one could see what I was going to do to the man Urushi dragged away. I then took the additional precaution of casting Silence as to ensure that his screams wouldn’t be heard by anyone outside the enclosure.</p>
<p>『We’d better get this done quick. Colbert’s already called the guards over.』</p>
<p>I immediately made a doppelganger and smacked the man across the face a few times in order to wake him up.</p>
<p>「Huh?」</p>
<p><i><b>Smack </b></i></p>
<p>「Argghh!」</p>
<p>「Heal.」</p>
<p>I punched the man right in the nose the moment he opened his eyes before fixing him right back up without so much as the slightest pause.</p>
<p>「Wha—」</p>
<p><i><b>Crack </b></i></p>
<p>「Grarrgh!!」</p>
<p>「Heal.」</p>
<p>I then repeated the process, but this time, I broke his legs instead of punching him.</p>
<p>And so the cycle continued. I hit him, and healed him, only to hit him and heal him some more. All in all, I had to do it about ten times before finally terrifying him to the point where he’d start screaming with his face twisted in fear the moment I even so much as moved a muscle.</p>
<p>Sweet. That should be enough to make him talk.</p>
<p>「I’ll stop doing this to you if you tell me what I want to know.」</p>
<p>「I-I’ll tell you everything! I’ll talk, so please, no more! Please!」</p>
<p>Everything from that point onward went just as smoothly as I’d hoped. The man answered all my questions without so much as even the slightest trace of a lie.</p>
<p>His group was nothing but a bunch of petty hoodlums. They didn’t have the spirit required for adventuring, nor the courage needed to step onto the battlefield as a mercenary. All their income came from them harassing the townsfolk.</p>
<p>Just last night, they were hired by a man whose identity they knew little of. They didn’t bother finding out either. All they really cared about was that the man had paid a generous ten thousand Golde per person. The task bestowed upon them was to harass and destroy a pair of stalls. Their group was normally a group of eight, but today, they’d split in two halves in order to more efficiently complete said task. The other stall they were asked to attack turned out to be the one run by the orphanage.</p>
<p>I tried prying so I could find out a bit more about that mysterious employer of theirs, but it turned out that the man I’d captured really didn’t know much, as he pretty much ended up getting treated like a disposable pawn. Oh well, time to hand him over to the guards, I guess.</p>
<p>「Oi, you.」</p>
<p>「Y-Yes?」</p>
<p>「I’m going to be handing you over to the guards now. Answer every question they ask you.」</p>
<p>「Y-Yessir.」</p>
<p>「But don’t even make the slightest mention of me. The moment you talk about me is the moment you’ll die.」</p>
<p>I poured magical energy into my fingers, causing them to emit light as I pressed them onto the man’s forehead.</p>
<p>「W-What’re you…」</p>
<p>「I cursed you. I’ll know the moment you tell anyone even the slightest thing about me.」</p>
<p>「I won’t tell anyone anything! I swear it! I swear I won’t!」</p>
<p>I didn’t <i>actually</i> do anything to him, the whole thing was just a bit bluff, a facade. It looked like he totally fell for it though.</p>
<p>「I’d say that doing your best to reform and becoming a functioning member of society would probably be to your benefit. Not even I know what I’ll do if you’re still the same scum you are now next time we meet.」</p>
<p>「I-I’ll definitely do my best! I swear I’ll never do anything bad again! Pl-Please, don’t kill me sir! I beg of you!」</p>
<p>And so, I let the man regroup with his companions so they could all be arrested and shipped off to wherever they were being taken together. Colbert seemed to make a bit of a skeptical expression because he noticed that one men was absolutely terrified, but luckily, he didn't ended up making anything of it.</p>
<p>『Looks like the orphanage is in trouble.』</p>
<p>（Master, go.）</p>
<p>『You sure?』</p>
<p>（Nn. I can’t leave.）</p>
<p>Fran was responsible for everything that happened here because she'd registered for me by proxy. Hence, she was obligated to stay with the stall and upservise it all the way through to the end. The Chef’s Guild’s staff was still watching her every move, so she couldn’t just up and leave without suffering the consequences.</p>
<p>『Alright then, I guess I’ll just take Urushi with me and go.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>（Leave stall to me.）</p>
<p>『Sure thing. Alright, let’s go Urushi!』</p>
<p>「Bork bork!」</p>
<p>Urushi transported me inside of his shadow as we began to move.</p>
<p>Being a sword, or rather, an inorganic, made life pretty convenient at times like this. Since I didn’t actually count as a real living thing, I could totally be treated like any other item and stored and stuff. Interestingly enough though, I could actually see the outside world from inside of Urushi’s shadow.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

<p>The wolf dashed through the city at full speed whilst simultaneously doing his best not to stand out. The guards had started chasing us on more than one occasion, but, they were far too slow to keep up with Urushi’s ridiculously high speed. Moreover, Urushi had a mark that proved he was Fran’s familiar. Said mark made everything a whole lot less of a pain in the ass. That said, we still couldn’t help but end up scaring a few children here and there along the way, but the most we could do was give them a mental apology seeing as the circumstances were what they were.</p>
<p>『I see it.』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>The orphanage stall was about as crowded as crowded could be, but despite that, it’s queue was incredibly well organised. Their customers managed to form a line about three hundred heads long without any sort of fuss. Holy crap.</p>
<p>「Woof woof.」</p>
<p>「Look! It’s Urushi!」</p>
<p>「Urushi!!!」</p>
<p>「Hey Urushi, what’re you doing here?」</p>
<p>The orphanage children immediately recognized Urushi and ran towards him. Wait, aren’t they supposed to be helping out or something?</p>
<p>I’d assumed they would be, but turning my gaze towards the stall allowed me to understand that there wasn’t any issue. The kids that ran over to us were the younger, livelier ones, whereas the ones helping out were the slightly older and more responsible ones.</p>
<p>Urushi seemed quite happy with the fact that the orphanage’s children had swarmed him in order to pet him, as most people ended up freezing up in fear the moment they saw him. The kids’ attitudes stemmed from the fact Fran and saved the orphanage. They thought of Urushi as her pet, and thus, viewed him in a rather favourable light.</p>
<p>Nothing’s seemed to have happened just yet, so I figured there wasn’t harm in sitting around and letting Urushi enjoy himself a bit longer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately though, my thoughts almost seemed to have jinxed the whole damn thing, as the peace was broken the moment after the idea crossed my mind.</p>
<p>「The fuck!? You fucking expect us to pay for <i>this!?</i> You been smokin some hot shit dawg, this shit soup ain’t got nothing but bushweed in it.」</p>
<p>「I-I’m terribly sorry…」</p>
<p>「Bitch, you think I’m going to just forgive yo dumb ass just 'cause you apologizin? Hell naw. You want me to forgive you? Close this shack ass stall down right the fuck now!」</p>
<p>「T-That’s…」</p>
<p>「You talkin back to me bitch?」</p>
<p>「I…」</p>
<p>A sense of deja vu assaulted me as I watched a group of unfashionable men harass Io and the children working by her side.</p>
<p>「P-Please forgive us.」</p>
<p>「I-I'm scared!!」</p>
<p>「Wahhhh!」</p>
<p>A few of the children began screaming and crying in response to the thugs’ intimidation.</p>
<p>「Shut cho ass up!」</p>
<p>「Get on all fours and beg! Do it, bitch!」</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, the men were definitely taking it too far. Io had long gone pale in the face.</p>
<p>『Get’em boy.』</p>
<p>「Grrrrrr」</p>
<p>「The fuck’s wrong with this mangy mutt?」</p>
<p>「The hell you looking at? I’ll kill yo as-argghghhghg!」</p>
<p>Urushi tackled one of the men. His body flew well over ten meters and landed with a crack as he transitioned into an unmoving lump.</p>
<p>The same soon happened to the other three. Each of the men flew through the streets like a bullet before collapsing.</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Yay! You did it!」</p>
<p>「You’re so cool, Urushi!!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi then proceeded to grab the men one by one and pile them all up in a single spot, after which he vaulted on top of them and howled as if to declare victory. This action led the children around him to cheer with even greater ferocity. Luckily, it looked like they didn’t end up traumatized as a result of the thugs’ actions.</p>
<p>The whole event came to a conclusion when a few guards came over and took the ruffians we beat down into custody.</p>
<p>I’m glad we managed to show up when we did. The orphanage would’ve ended up in a pretty bad spot otherwise. Whoever was responsible for this was one hell of a conniving cunt.</p>
<p>『That’s that taken care of, so let’s lead back.』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>I mean, there was no way there was going to be more than one set of thugs attacking each place in a single day anyways.</p>
<p>The day passed as per my expectations. Everything from that one point onwards went as smoothly as could be, and we ended without any other disturbances.</p>
<p>Every single participant was obligated to return to the Chef’s Guild at the day’s end in order to temporarily hand over their stalls. There, we learned that similar things had happened to a few other participants as well. Specifically, the orphanage aside, there were two that’d suffered from similar circumstances: The Dragon’s Table and The Noble’s Dish.</p>
<p>「Any problems?」</p>
<p>「None. The Dragon’s Table’s shopkeeper used to be an A ranked adventurer before retiring.」</p>
<p>「Strong?」</p>
<p>「He’s still more than strong enough to handle a few petty criminals. They say he used to hunt Dragons so he could use their meat in his dishes back in the day.」</p>
<p>Huh, a former A rank dragon slayer? That’s pretty interesting. He just so happened to be talking with one of the guild’s clerks, so I decided to give him a quick once over in order to check out his stats.</p>
<p>『Woah, he’s 60? Holy crap!』</p>
<p>He honestly looked to me like he was in his mid 40’s. Moreover, he was still pretty strong. Retirement had caused his skills and stats to weaken to the point where he was statistically inferior to Colbert. However, if you were to compare the two, I’d say with confidence that the former would be much more difficult to defeat than the latter.</p>
<p>I could tell at a glance that he was experienced in battle. The craftyness derived from his knowledge base would be far more troublesome an asset than sheer numbers.</p>
<p>I then turned towards and observed the guy who appeared to be in charge of The Noble’s Dish. He was followed by a series of cronies, and gave off an attitude that seemed to stress self-importance over all. Apparently, he himself was the Lord’s third son, and was currently acting as a chef under his older brother’s, the second son’s employ.</p>
<p>Honestly, he seemed pretty damn weak. How the hell did he manage to drive his assailants away?</p>
<p>「I heard that he prostrated himself before telling them that he didn’t care what they did to him. However, he begged and begged for them them to at least overlook his customers. The thugs ended up losing interest and leaving shortly after.」</p>
<p>Huh… That might end up making The Noble’s Dish quite a bit more popular than they were before.</p>
<p>Thankfully, none of the four shops attacked actually ended up suffering any losses. However, that wasn’t to say that everything was already done and over with; we’d have to be cautious going forward as well.</p>
<p>What a pain in the ass…</p>
<p>I’d like to prevent anything from happening to the orphanage if possible. Hopefully, they’d be able to fend for themselves. I did hear that some of their alumni were going to start guarding them as of tomorrow. Said alumni had ended up becoming adventurers after gaining their independence, so they <i>should</i> be okay.</p>
<p>Either way, the first day had now come to an end. We’d already returned our cart and parted ways with Colbert and the three salesgirls. We ended up selling a whole seven thousand servings, much more than I’d initially expected. I was going to have to work hard tonight so I could replenish our stocks.</p>
<p>I started thinking back on the day’s events as I worked. It was pretty obvious that whole reason we ended up getting assaulted was because one of the twenty participants was trying to get rid of as many of their competitors as possible. That said, there were far more than just twenty suspects, seeing as how almost everyone had sponsors and backers and whatnot. The only four people I could possibly exclude from the list of suspects would be the victims themselves.</p>
<p>Wait… hold on a second. Why did The Noble’s Dish manage to get away with nothing more than a few moments worth of prostration? The orphanage was about to have their stall completely torn down in spite of their apologies.</p>
<p>Yeah, this totally feels like a set-up.</p>
<p>It’s possible that the thugs ended up deciding not to mess with The Nobel's Dish because the guy running the place was the local Lord’s son, but I doubt it. There had to be more to it than just that.</p>
<p>It’d probably be good for us to keep an eye on them for the time being.</p>
<p>『Urushi.』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>『Do you still remember how the Lord’s third son smelled?』</p>
<p>「Bork.」</p>
<p>『Alright, can you do me a favour and keep an eye on him and check what he’s up to?』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>I had to stay here and keep making curry bread. Fran was still growing, so she couldn’t afford to stay up. Moreover, she’s going to be responsible for protecting the stall tomorrow too, so she’s going to need all the energy she can get. In other words, Urushi was the only one left available for the job.</p>
<p>『I’m counting on you, boy!』</p>
					
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>118. The Second Day<br>
</b><br>
Fran and I started getting everything ready for tomorrow after seeing Urushi on his way.</p>
<p>I was originally planning on saving the spicy kind so I could introduce it on the second day, but all the stress had gotten to me, and I accidentally ended up having them sold alongside our other two flavours. In other words, I’d have to introduce a brand new flavour in order to make sure everything went according to plan.</p>
<p><span id="more-426"></span></p>
<p>「Master. Thought up new curry dish.」</p>
<p>『Oh? Sounds interesting. What kind?』</p>
<p>「Combination of Master’s best dishes. Curry sushi.」</p>
<p>『Not bad. The name’s got a good weight to it.』</p>
<p>I can’t really speak for the taste though. The combination seemed so odd that I couldn’t even fathom it. Moreover was the fact that the concept itself didn’t really seem all that applicable to curry bread in particular.</p>
<p>But that aside, I did have a pretty good idea myself.</p>
<p>What I needed to make was a super spice that transcended the realm of super spices, a super spice that went even further beyond. Naturally, a flavour as potent as that would need itself a pretty solid name. I’d considered a few things like Death Spice and Ogre Spice, but I ultimately ended up going with Dragon Spice. Dragons were considered the world’s most powerful creatures, and the whole idea was that the spice was the same. I was thinking of giving it a dragon themed slogan too. I could totally see it selling if we said that “eating it’ll make you breathe fire, just like a dragon!”</p>
<p>The Dragon Spice Curry Bread had a bit of alteration put into three different parts of its cooking process. First was the filling. Most of my other curries had been made Japanese style. They’d also only used a single type of meat. The Dragon Spice, on the other hand, was a pork and beef curry that moreso followed the Indian Qeema style. The dough I was using for its breading had a bit of black spice mixed into it, and as a result, shone with a much darker lustre. The final change was the manner in which it was deep fried; I mixed quite a bit of lard into the oil so I could fully draw out the curry's taste. [1]</p>
<p>I then came up with an iteration of our mildest flavour. The idea was to remove a bit of spice, add some cheese and ultimately craft a batch of Cheese Curry Bread. [2]</p>
<p>Furthermore, I'd improve the recipe even further by grabbing all the bread crumbs I’d gotten from the whole frying processes I’d done over the past few days. The point was to rub them into the Cheese Curry Bread’s dough. I figured children would enjoy the texture more that way.</p>
<p>I couldn’t make all that many of either of the two new variations, but I estimated that I should be able to ramp production up enough to get us at least a solid two thousand of each. Besides, the idea was to call these products limited edition anyways. We'd them at twenty Golde a piece, with a limit on four of each type per customer. I was almost completely sure that our strategy would cause them to sell. The urge to collect the scarce was something that would have an effect on people regardless of what world they resided in.</p>
<p>「As expected of Master.」</p>
<p>『I’ll work on the two new products I just introduced. Fran, you focus on deep frying the stuff that’s already been prepped.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The two additional types we’d come up with ended up leaving us with a total of five different product variations.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the two of us silently worked until the clock struck midnight. It was only then that I finally finished getting a large batch of curry bread ready to be deep fried.</p>
<p>『Whew. That’s half done.』</p>
<p>「Good work.」</p>
<p>『Thanks. Wait, what’s that?』</p>
<p>Fran had finished with all the frying she’d been assigned a bit earlier, so she’d moved on to cooking up a little something in a pot.</p>
<p>「Curry sushi. Complete.」</p>
<p>Fran would normally mind how tedious the work was, but today all her reluctance had been thoroughly suppressed by her curiosity. The pot beside her looked like something along the lines of curry. She’d swapped one of the ingredients out for a fishy stock, and caused the pot's contents to moreso resemble a soup than a curry. Beside said batch of soup-like curry was a few pieces of the tuna sushi we’d made back on the ship.</p>
<p>「Put sauce on sushi. Eat.」</p>
<p>『I see.』</p>
<p>Fran immediately began pressuring me into consuming her creation.</p>
<p>「Try?」</p>
<p>『S-Sure…』</p>
<p>I’ll admit the dish was a bit weird and off putting. However, Fran was its creator, and thus, I had absolutely no choice but to eat it. Period. Full stop.</p>
<p>Thus, I made a doppelganger, grabbed a piece of sushi and dipped it right into the pot of curry. Again, I couldn’t help but note that it didn’t look delicious. Seeing a piece of tuna smothered in yellow sauce did nothing but curb my appetite.</p>
<p>But that didn’t matter! There was no way any real man could possibly back off from a situation like this one!</p>
<p>「Here goes.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Nom nom nom…</p>
<p>Huh? That’s weird. It doesn’t taste bad at all. In fact, I’d say it was pretty good. For some odd reason, the curry’s spices actually managed to draw out the Tuna’s flavour. The vinegared sushi rice actually seemed to work decently well with the whole combination too.</p>
<p>Or actually, I guess this does make sense. Fran’s cooking is maxed out, and she’s even got a title for it. She would actually be even better than I am at it should she give it her all. Needless to say, the making of this dish had caused her to do exactly that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I still don’t really think that the whole thing she’s got going here is something we can actually apply to curry bread, but, she seemed satisfied with the result, so all was good. After confirming my approval, she polished off the rest of the sushi before heading back to the inn with her spirits high.</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, had no choice to get back to work. That said, I’d just managed to get myself a portion of Fran’s cooking, something that was pretty much of legendary rarity. Hence, I was as pumped as could be, and ready to fry all night.</p>
<p>The first thing we did the next day was submit a few documents to the cooking guild so that we could get our new merch approved. We’d written all ingredients in the documents we handed over, so they ended up giving us an immediate thumbs up after giving the products a quick sample.</p>
<p>Our second day went much better than our first. News about our products had spread through word of mouth overnight. As a result, we ended up being permanently stuck with a line about two hundred heads long. Our two new additions were doing just as well as anticipated, and as I’d expected, the cheese type was especially popular amongst children.</p>
<p>Moreover was the fact that we’d yet to experience any sort of trouble.</p>
<p>Speaking of trouble, The Noble’s Dish had managed to benefit from it greatly. Rumours of their “benevolence” had spread throughout the town, and as a result, they ended up being much more popular than they'd been the day before. I heard that they’d also hired a few adventurers as guards as a result of yesterday’s occurrences.</p>
<p>I thought it to be odd, so I ended up appraising the people going around spreading the aforementioned rumours.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Are you kidding me!? Each and every single one of the rumour spreaders was a goddamn hoodlum; they all had level one intimidation. There was no way in hell people like <i>them</i> would go out of their way just to sing someone praise.</p>
<p>This be suspicious as all hell. Urushi’ll probably be able to fill us in on a few more details once he gets back. I’d very much prefer if nothing happened, but having information just in case would be pretty handy.</p>
<p>And again, I jinxed it. The moment the thought crossed my mind was the moment something happened. It looked like someone had tried to bud into the line, and thus, he ended up arguing with a few of the other customers.</p>
<p>Fran and Colbert quickly rushed over in order to resolve the situation. However, it seemed to resolve itself before they got there. One of the people in line had been an adventurer. Said adventurer had quickly pinned down the man that’d tried to bud.</p>
<p>Something about the unruly man felt a bit off. He continued to shout what sounded like nonsense despite having been thoroughly physically repressed. It almost seemed as if the guy had been high as a kite.</p>
<p>Appraising him returned the result that he was suffering from an abnormal status condition. Specifically, he was afflicted with the “Agitated Heart of Evil." The heck was that supposed to be? Is it any different from just being a bad person?</p>
<p>We immediately cast Refresh and returned the man’s mental state to its usual demeanor. He didn’t lash out or anything like that again thereafter.</p>
<p>「Thanks for watching over him and waiting till we got here.」</p>
<p>「No problem. Thanks for all your the work you put into keeping the peace.」</p>
<p>「Alright, you. Stand up and walk. Man, I can’t believe how many people have been acting up like this today. It feels like I’ve been escorting rowdy festival goers all day.」</p>
<p>Was the guy just one of many rampaging drunks or something? I mean, the people back in Japan would end up getty pretty unruly during festivals too. They’d often end up brawling and committing petty thievery and whatnot. The phenomenon was described as falling to the devil’s temptations, and I didn’t see any reason for it not to occur here in this world as well.</p>
<p>There were only two interesting things that happened after the man’s initial onslaught. The first was us getting harassed by yet another one of his kind. The second was when a bunch of dudes with serious looking expressions joined the line. I mean, they hadn’t really tried to bother the other customers or anything like that, so I figured that they were just adventurers or mercenaries. The only issue was that they were so overly grim that seeing them ended up making everyone else feel a bit unsettled. They weren’t really our only set of weird customers, and it wasn’t like we could send them away just cause their faces looked a bit intimidating at a glance.</p>
<p>It turned out that the reason they’d come was because they’d heard rumours of our Dragon Spice variation. The adventurers had started talking about it, and it’d become a widespread claim that only a true man could appreciate its flavour. Thus, many adventurers had ended up coming over to the stall in order to undergo a sort of trial.</p>
<p>「It appears that I <i>may</i> have exaggerated a bit too much.」</p>
<p>God damn it Colbert, this was your fault!?</p>
<p>Apparently, he’d claimed to have passed out as a result of its intense taste, and thus, spurred on all our make a man out of you type guests.</p>
<p>Yeah, we ultimately decided to end up just pretending they were regular people. They certainly were standing out, but they didn’t cause any harm, and even served to function as deterrents for any potential aggressors, so yeah. Why not, right?</p>
<p>In other words, the number of real problems we ended up running into before finally making our way back to the Chef’s Guild was two.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>I immediately looked towards the Lord’s third son upon our arrival. He was surrounded by his cronies as usual, but Urushi was far out of sight. My guess was that the wolf was observing from a bit further away.</p>
<p>「It looks like we did pretty well today~」</p>
<p>「Victory is within our grasp.」</p>
<p>The noble had come to the guild with more than just his staff members. He’d also brought along some guards, and even the merchant responsible for replenishing his stocks. He even had a few additional noble-like people with him this time, which I figured was pretty much natural seeing as how he was the son of a Lord. They were all really haughty and cocky looking. There was no way in hell anyone like them would ever prostrate before a mere commoner, even if said commoner was a customer.</p>
<p>I wanted to observe the group for faults, but was ultimately interrupted as someone approached Fran and started up a conversation with her.</p>
<p>「Good evening.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Evening.」</p>
<p>「I am The Dragon’s Table’s owner. The name is Fermus.」</p>
<p>The man who named himself Fermus had wavy long hair, and a pair of thin, wide eyes. He stood at about a hundred and eighty centimeters tall. Despite the fact that he was fully clothed, I could tell at a glance that his entire body was constructed of steel-like muscle; his long limbs were built as could be.</p>
<p>His face was decorated with a gentle smile, one that I was sure had taken the hearts of many a woman captive. Even the man’s wrinkles seemed to add to his charm. He seriously didn’t look his age. I couldn’t shake the impression that he just had to be in his mid forties.</p>
<p>I did as I had yesterday and once again gave him a quick scan, and verified once more than the numbers I'd seen were correct. He really was sixty, and a pure blooded human at that. The hell sort of anti-aging cream was he using!?</p>
<p>「Nn. Fran.」</p>
<p>「You see, I have recently had the opportunity to sample your shop’s curry bread.」</p>
<p>Oh? Is he trying to pick a fight, or…?</p>
<p>「I have to say, eating it really inflicted me with quite a bit of emotion. Tasting something so unique left me feeling moved, its flavour was one I’d never before even imagined. I believe they say that it was your master that constructed the dish?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Master’s creation.」</p>
<p>「And a wonderful creation it is. Please relay to your master that I was incredibly impressed with his work.」</p>
<p>Being praised by a chef as accomplished as the man standing before me gave me a rush of dopamine.</p>
<p>『Do me a favour and tell him that I’m delighted to hear his words.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Master happy.」</p>
<p>「Please do stop by my store with your master sometime. That concludes my business, so I shall be taking my leave for now. I do hope to see you there.」</p>
<p>Fermus did as he said and left immediately afterwards. His actions were mirrored by a few other chefs, they each approached us in turn in order to sing praises of how unique and delicious our product was. I couldn’t help but feel the urge to smile. Each and every single one of them was offering honest praise.</p>
<p>That, however, was soon interrupted as the Lord’s third son approached us. All the other chefs backed away the moment they saw him start to move in our direction.</p>
<p>「Ugh, I don’t like that guy.」</p>
<p>「All of his profits come from his connections.」</p>
<p>「He definitely goes out of his way to make himself look good too.」</p>
<p>「The guy has a lot of rumours about him, so be careful, alright?」</p>
<p>The chefs immediately began bad mouthing him as they took their distances. Looked like he wasn’t what you’d call liked.</p>
<p>「The name’s Waint. I hail from The Noble Dish, and like the others, I have also recently had the opportunity to sample Curry Bread.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「It was quite the wonderful dish. It had a novel taste to it, and contained within it a series of vivid flavours.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I wish us both luck in this competition going forward.」</p>
<p>Pretty much everything that came out of his mouth had been a lie. Moreover, the guy totally started wiping his hands off after exchanging handshakes with Fran.</p>
<p>「What an extraneous amount of effort that must have taken. I never would have expected you to not only be obligated to exchange handshakes with, but also compliment a filthy beastman.」</p>
<p>「Fret not. It’s not too hard a task to complete if you think it an act done in good humour.」</p>
<p>These sons of bitches start shit-talking the moment they thought they were out of earshot! You know what? Fine. If you think your hand’s all that dirty, I’ll solve your little problem by cutting it the hell off. That way, you’ll never have to deal with having a dirty hand again.</p>
<p>Shit! Where the hell is Urushi? He’s probably got some sort of evidence by now. I swear I’m going to use whatever he found to shove that piece of shit convicted of literally everything at the very first possible opportunity!</p>
<p>I can’t do anything for now, but polish that head of yours, you piece of shit! Cause I’m making a trophy out of it!</p>
<p>We, or rather, I headed back to the kitchen we rented out with my mood as sour as could be. Unlike me, Fran didn't really seem to care. She was rather neutral about the whole thing.</p>
<p>「Master.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, I know.』</p>
<p>Fran was on guard, she looked at the restaurant we’d borrowed with her senses turned up to max. Likewise, I toned down my anger and began focusing on the much more important task of observing our surroundings.</p>
<p>We sensed several people within the former restaurant premises despite that fact that we were the only ones that should’ve had access. This time around, our guests really were completely uninvited; they were trespassing on our properties whilst we were away. I wanted to just get in there and slaughter them all, but we didn’t own the place, so I didn’t feel right busting it up or getting blood stains all over its woodwork.</p>
<p>『Let’s sneak up on them and incapacitate them for now.』</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>We thinned out our presences and silently approached the kitchen door. We sensed four intruders in total. Two were in the storefront part of the building, and the other two in the kitchen part.</p>
<p>Our first move was to cast Silence and stick the key into the door. Strangely enough, the lock was still in the same state it’d been in the morning when we left. Did they break in from the storefront side? Oh well, no point thinking about now. We’ll just beat it out of them later.</p>
<p>We ever so slightly opened the door just enough so that we could see into the building. None of the intruders looked to be in plain sight, they were hiding.</p>
<p>Were they trying to ambush us? Yeah, that’s not really going to work, not on us at least.</p>
<p>『I’ll get the one on the right. You get the one on the left.』</p>
<p>（Nn.）</p>
<p>I rushed into the room whilst expanding Silence’s range to cover its entirety. I then immediately struck the man hiding behind the door frame with a bolt of lightning and caused him to pass out with his lips flapping wildly.</p>
<p>Likewise, Fran had also paralyzed her target with the magic equivalent of a taser. We then promptly had both restrained before moving onto their companions.</p>
<p>The other two invaders met a similar set of fates. All four were actually decently strong. Even the weakest of them was at least level twenty. They probably would’ve been able to beat Fran if she was just any other D ranked adventurer. Did they not learn from what happened last time? Wait, were these people even connected to the other group that attacked us?</p>
<p>We lined up the four assailants and began our usual interrogation processes. To be specific, we started with the highest level dude, the one that looked most leaderlike.</p>
<p>「Awake?」</p>
<p>「W-What in the… Untie me!」</p>
<p>「Might. Depends on answers. Here, why?」</p>
<p>「The hell? Like I know! You think you can get away with this, girl!?」</p>
<p>And so, ten odd minutes passed.</p>
<p>All four men were now sitting with their legs tucked underneath their thighs and their butts on their heels. A single glance at their faces revealed that they were now but shadows of their former selves. What a wonderful sight. [3]</p>
<p>「Summary. Attacked me to stop participation in King of Cooking?」</p>
<p>「Y-Yes Ma’am.」</p>
<p>Weren’t we getting attacked a bit <i>too</i> often? Like, could they cut it out already? It isn’t even threatening, it’s just annoying.</p>
<p>Asking about the person behind all of this ended up providing us a with a name that we'd yet to know.</p>
<p>「Man behind this. Named Rynford?」</p>
<p>「Yes ma’am.」</p>
<p>Apparently this Rynford guy was some old man staying alongside a few subordinates at the manor we identified a few days back. The men here were hired by said Rynford.</p>
<p>So why was Rynford they trying to mess with us anyways? Was he trying to back up the Lord’s third son and increase his chances at winning? Or was it maybe something related to the whole alchemist thing that was going on a few days back? Or maybe this Rynford guy worked for the alchemist? But if that’s the case, then why try to stop us of all people?</p>
<p>We need more information. At this rate though, it really seemed that we might have to end up raiding the manor after all…</p>
<p>『Looks like we’re stuck waiting for Urushi.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Disclaimer: It’s not my fault if I’m making you hungry! I’m just giving you more context and stuff, the job isn't complete without it since chances are you guys don't know what the food actually looks/smells/tastes like!</p>
<p>[1] Qeema aka Keema is an Indian dish that gained popularity in Japan. While the Indians do still retain their traditional recipes for it, the Japanese variant has naturally been adapted to better suit their tastes.</p>

<p>[2] Cheese curry bread is literally exactly what it sounds like. It's curry bread, but with cheese. The flavour is often adjusted so it's a bit less spicy.</p>

<p>[3] This means they're sitting in seiza, a traditional Japanese posture often used for repentance and discipline. Sitting in it for a long time kinda hurts.</p>

		<p><b>119. Side: Bluke</b></p>
<p>「What!? What in God's name is going on!?」</p>
<p>Why won’t everything bend to my wishes!? Barbra is nothing short of a metropolis, and I, Bluke Krysten, am its Lord’s second son. By that logic, the very city should bend to my will!</p>
<p><span id="more-435"></span></p>
<p>「Zerais! Did you not claim that the city would be thrown astir? Explain yourself!」</p>
<p>I glared upon the petite man standing before me. He appeared thin and unhealthy as ever, but he more than had his uses.</p>
<p>His name was as I’d shouted moments before. He was former disciple to the Adventurer’s Guild’s famed Eugene, and also the reason for which the great alchemist was expunged from his companions’ circle. The same fate had naturally befallen Zerais, and hence, he’d fallen into the grasp of Barbra’s underground. His current tasks mainly involved participation in the illegal.</p>
<p>Frankly, he was a madman. His research involved infusing magic crystals into human flesh, all in the name of creating members of the demon race. Truly, a realm of research from which even the Gods themselves would veer. However, the man was quite competent in spite of his lunacy, and as a result, he and I had experienced together .</p>
<p>The potions and poisons he produced truly put their value on display in my times of need. They would allow me to overturn a woman’s decision should she reject the offer to be made into one of my concubines. More importantly, they could even be used to silence the commoners that wished to prattle to my father of my misdeeds.</p>
<p>Our association has granted me the ability to prosper, and it is through him that I was able to obtain my current position.</p>
<p>「Oh, that. Looks to me like someone’s been getting in our way.」</p>
<p>「I demand more details.」</p>
<p>Had my plans been exposed…?</p>
<p>「Are you familiar with the name “The Black Tail?”」</p>
<p>「I haven’t the slightest clue.」</p>
<p>If I were to guess, I would likely assume it to be some sort of restaurant. I fail to see how a mere restaurant would have any sort of association with my goals. [1]</p>
<p>「The Black Tail is one of the participants in this year’s King of Cooking.」</p>
<p>「And what of it? I see no correlation.」</p>
<p>「The stall I mentioned earlier is making use of magic-infused water in its products. Specifically, it’s using the Water of Recovery, which dispels the effects of any abnormal status conditions cast on the consumer within the past few days.」</p>
<p>「Really now？」</p>
<p>I doubt that a mere street stall would have the capacity to mass produce magic-infused water.</p>
<p>「It’s true. I had one of my subordinates get his hands on one of their products. Their items have recovery-based properties.」</p>
<p>「Tsk. In other words, they are ruining our plans then?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, especially seeing as how they’re selling their products for just ten Golde apiece.」</p>
<p>「So they’ve essentially flooded the markets?」</p>
<p>「I’m pretty sure they’ve been selling at least five thousand units a day.」</p>
<p>「There’s a fair chance that most of The Noble Dish’s customers will have ingested their products as well.」</p>
<p>I doubt that their decision was one made as a result of their knowledge of my plans. That, however, doesn’t change their fate. Anyone who stands in my path shall be eliminated, be their intrusional intentional or otherwise.</p>
<p>「Crush them.」</p>
<p>「I already hired and sent a few people over, but none have managed to succeed.」</p>
<p>「Did they hire some sort of guard?」</p>
<p>「It seems like they’ve Iron Claw Colbert. He practically stays with them all day. The shopkeeper’s also an adventurer herself, and a D ranked one at that.」</p>
<p>「And what of Rynford’s subordinates? The only reason I decided to shelter him was so that he could be of use at times like these.」</p>
<p>Rynford was the name of one of Zerais’ fellow researchers. Specifically, Zerais had introduced him two months prior. Though he was a researcher, he appeared moreso like a mercenary. Most of his subordinates were well versed in combat. Many of them bore scars upon their knees, and thus, were suspicious. They likely would not have been allowed to enter the city if not for my influence. Nowadays, the man spent each day holed up within this precise manor. He was an even more peculiar man than Zerais himself, but, he too was useful, especially when it came time for the application of violence.</p>
<p>「Rynford had sent several of his level twenty plus subordinates, but…」</p>
<p>「You mean to say they failed? How ridiculous! The shop’s owner is but a mere D rank!」</p>
<p>「Not a single one of them has returned. Rynford’s assault was not actually the first. I began by hiring a set of lackeys from the city’s underground, but lost contact with them after sending them on their way. I can’t even confirm as to whether they’re dead or alive.」</p>
<p>「That… is concerning. Does the shop’s owner perhaps have some sort of hidden escort guarding her at all times?」</p>
<p>「I have no idea. I tried looking into her, but I all I could dig up was that she was a D ranked adventurer, and that she’d been rewarded with a near excessive number of spices for her contribution in defeating a set of pirates.」</p>
<p>「Place more effort into your investigations.」</p>
<p>「I already tried that. She’d only just arrived in Barbra, so detailed information about her is difficult to come by. The only other fact we have is that she came to the city aboard one of the Luciel Conglomerate’s ships. We did manage to bribe one of the ship’s workers, but all we got from him was the time in which she’d arrived at the city.」</p>
<p>In other words, there was no way for us to grasp ahold of her weaknesses!? Accursed peasant! I cannot believe that my plans are about to be spoiled by a mere plebeian.</p>
<p>「Shall we employ mercenaries then? I doubt she would be able to survive a wave of thirty regardless of the extent of her abilities.」<br>
「Won’t your honoured father catch wind of your movements if you don't keep them in moderation?」</p>
<p>「Tsk.」</p>
<p>確かに、親父の配下はバルボラ中にいるからな。下手な真似をしたら、俺のクーデターに感付かれる可能性もある。<br>
My old man did have several subordinates within the city’s confines. There was a chance he’d catch wind of my plans for a coup d’etat if I didn’t keep my actions minimal. Fuck!</p>
<p>How obnoxious. How long does that old shit plan to stand in my way? The only reason I wished to take his seat in the first place was because of his lack of ability to discern quality.</p>
<p>“Your not worthy of the Lord’s position” my ass! My older brother is nothing short of trash. His only defining trait is his ability to be diligent. He lacks my intellect, and even so much as fails to to understand what it means to have a nobleman’s pride. The fact that he takes a servile attitude even when speaking with commoners irritates me to point of wanting to fucking strangle him!</p>
<p>He was nothing but a weak, weak man. I was a far more suitable heir, and it was precisely the knowledge of that fact that led me to wish to wrest the position from right under his nose.</p>
<p>My plan was to cause Barbra to descend into mayhem and then shift all the blame onto my father in order to force him into retirement. Normally, my brother would end up becoming the lord in such a case, so I’d arrange to have him killed in the chaos.</p>
<p>Causing all that chaos was Zerais’ job. The first plan we had was to have him poison a group of plebeians and have them rampage. However, we soon realized that such a meagre act would take a few dozen lives at most.</p>
<p>Such a small scale event was far from what we needed to fulfil our desires. Thus, Zerais crafted a second, more devastating scheme, one that would cause the whole town to descend into not but madness and destruction.</p>
<p>Naturally, I accepted his proposal. It was one that would cause many to perish, but I paid it no mind. Most were mere plebeians, and thus, irrelevant. Little of value would be sacrificed.</p>
<p>There was, however, one key factor required for our plan to come to fruition: Waint Krystan, my mentally deficient younger brother.</p>
<p>Waint was so stupid that not even I, his flesh and blood, could resist proclaiming him a retard. He’d been born as a Marquis’ third son, but he ended something as peasant-like as a chef for reasons nothing short of ridiculous. I paid little care to the details, but I recall his reasoning as something as nonsensical as adoring the taste of the food the Royal Palace's dishes.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>He and I had two clearly distinct mentalities. If I were to follow ambitions like his, I would seek to become a titan by acquiring cooking-related businesses and expanding through investment. He, on the other hand, actually became a stupid fucking pleb, and even went as far as to open his own shop. I remember trying out his cooking once, but it'd consisted of nothing but flavourless garbage. Believe it or not, the moron had even lost all his ambition. All he desired now was become a famous chef, and so the retard developed the habit of buying expensive materials just so he could transform them into worthless plates of junk.</p>
<p>I never once suspected that his meaningless, idiotic ambitions would culminate in a form from which I could find use. I employed him by investing into his shop and financially subordinating him.</p>
<p>Nobles that wished to build connections with my father and I frequented the shop. However, for reasons unknown, they soon began to flatter the wrong individual. They spoke of my brother's accomplishments and named him a chef of skill. Sheer nonsense. Waint's ability was laughable. He himself lacked the skill to break through King of Cooking's preliminaries, so I offered my assistance through the act of donating to the Chef's Guild a large sum. Through said donation, I allowed my brother to bypass the initial competition and immediately enter into the second round.</p>
<p>I later discovered, however, that he was even less of an intellectual that I'd surmised. The retard hired a gathering of loose-lipped grunts in order to harass his competitors. Shocked I was to see him even send a group after his own shop so he could perform a sort of stage act. His actions naturally led the guild to immediately begin an investigation, and thus, I once again had to step in as to prevent his disqualification. Many of the guild's staff members worked to retain the competition's fidelity. However, as was with all other organisations, there lay corrupt individuals within their ranks, all of which happily casted their duties aside in order to accept my bribes.</p>
<p>And that was the sequence of events that led up to this point, the point where I could finally put my plan into action.</p>
<p>The concept was as follows: Waint would make use of a specific class of magic-infused water, one that cursed any who ingested it. Of course, the plan was one doomed to fail lest we won over individuals within the guild — but that was a hurdle long overcome.</p>
<p>Our magic-infused water was a formula that Zerais and Rynford had developed in cohesion. I knew little of the details, but I was aware that the curse it spread was one that caused evil thoughts to develop within its victims. It could provoke any given individual into throwing a fit of violent rage so long as they consumed a substantial quantity of the substance. Most impressive was the substance's delayed effect. The plebeians that consumed it would only lose their minds after enough time had come to pass. Thus, they would disperse from the water's source before any sort of unnatural occurrence. Waint himself was nothing short of an idiot, and for reason unknown, thought what we had given to be plain magic-infused water. Everything was perfect; my pawn had not even so much as realized that he was being merely being used.</p>
<p>The publicity provided from the King of Cooking provided The Noble's Dish a grand total of 3000 customers each day. Basic mathematics led to the conclusion that the number of customers would ultimately culminate at approximately 10000, a number that more than satisfied my requirements. All that was needed was for us to let loose the familiars upon which Zerais had research in order to accomplish our goals.</p>
<p>The occurrence of such widespread insanity would leave Barbra's lord with no choice but to claim responsibility for the events that had perspired. He would be pardoned with only retirement if luck were to be on his side. However, there was also a chance that the Lord himself would be resigned to a status equivalent to that of a criminal's. Barbra was a major portside city, and of great importance to the Kingdom. Failing in its governance was a grave sin.</p>
<p>Hah! The thought of sending my father to trial put an unerasable smile upon my face.</p>
<p>My plans had been perfect.</p>
<p>Yet, they'd failed.</p>
<p>A fool had accidentally thrown off my predictions through the act of creating a sort of bread that nullified curses. Ridiculous! It was nothing but ridiculous! Don’t fuck with me!</p>
<p>Zerais’ reports stated that the crime rate had indeed risen on a year to year basis. However, the situation had yet to spiral out of hand.</p>
<p>Something had to be done.</p>
<p>The Black Tail must be no more.</p>
<p>「Use <i>him</i>.」</p>
<p>「Are you sure? He may end up causing quite the amount of damage.」</p>
<p>「He is our only option!」</p>
<p>「Alright. I understand. I’ll bring him here.」</p>
<p>A man over two meters tall appeared before after ten minutes worth of waiting. His body was covered in a layer of scarred, coppery skin. His muscles appeared so expansive that the simple act of witnessing them led me to suspect that we never had the need to employ a method as roundabout as cursing the citizens in the first place. His flesh bore such strength that I would not have doubted any claims suggesting that his heritage had been part ogre.</p>
<p>He was Rynford’s strongest subordinate, a former C ranked adventurer. The rumors said that he was just as strong as any B rank, but was denied promotion as a result of his behaviour. To verify the claim, I had him duel one of my former C ranked subordinates. Lo and behold, he lived up to his reputation and vanquished the man in a matter of moments.</p>
<p>They called him Zerrosreed The Berserker. He had little interest in anything but strengthening his body. He was what one could call a battle fanatic, a warrior sought out powerful foes for the sole sake of self improvement. He was known to even turn his blade on his companions and allies on a daily basis without even the slightest shred of care. More than one of these occasions had culminated in the act of manslaughter.</p>
<p>That alone did was but one of his many faults. Zerrosreed was well known for a certain incident, an incident that provided him two things: expulsion from the adventurer’s guild, and a bounty that extended throughout the continent. The man had been employed by a nearby country for the sake of war. However, as anticipated by many, he turned his blade on his allies for the sake of testing his strength, and so, he'd felled the country's prince, slayed him in cold blood. The act destroyed his allies’ chain of command and caused them to to lose most their forces. The country suffered a huge territorial loss, and thus, issued a price for his head. Such a act would cause many a warrior to live their lives in shame. He, however, had not the slightest semblance of repentance or atonement. In fact, the man claimed to be grateful. The bounty had led many a powerful to challenge him to combat.</p>
<p>Comprehending a specimen such as himself was impossible. All that I knew was that his brain was constructed of muscle, and that he possessed a ridiculous amount of power.</p>
<p>「I’ve a job for you.」</p>
<p>「Haven’t any chances to go on a good old rampage lately, so gimme something that’ll let me loose.」</p>
<p>「I see no problems satisfying that condition. A rampage is all I would ever hope from you to begin with.」</p>
<p>「Hah hah hah! True, true.」</p>
<p>I failed to see the reason for which the oversized man had clasped his belly in laughter, but cast all considerations aside. I needed not to understand but the fact that he could be used.</p>
<p>（Woof!）</p>
<p>「What was that…?」</p>
<p>I could have sworn that I caught wind of some sort of bark-like noise from a nearby room. That, however, was nonsensical. This manor was one that kept no pets, it was simply not possible for there to be such a sound.</p>
<p>「Perhaps I have allowed myself more exhaustion than is reasonable.」</p>
<p>The dog I heard was ultimately dismissed as a mere figment of my imagination.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>[1] "The Black Tail" is not actually the full name, but I left it like that because it sounds better. The last character in the name is 亭, which can mean inn or restaurant amongst a few other things. Hence, the actual name can be, but is not always necessarily interpreted as "The Black Tail Restaurant." Hence, he's unsure but able to guess correctly.</p>

		<p><b>120. Taking the Initiative</b></p>
<p>The second day was over, and so, Fran and I naturally had to begin preparing for the third. I really would’ve wanted everything go smoothly for once, but our processes were interrupted as we detected yet another group approaching the restaurant we were borrowing. This time, however, neither Fran nor I bothered to tense up or prepare ourselves for combat.</p>
<p><span id="more-443"></span></p>
<p>「Master.」</p>
<p>『Yup, Urushi’s back. Though. it looks like he’s got a few people following him…』</p>
<p>「Four.」</p>
<p>Focusing a bit more effort into reading our surroundings allowed me to figure out roughly what was going on. The people accompanying Urushi were all people we were pretty well acquainted with. That is, I was able to recognize them as Colbert and the three salesgirls. However, I wasn’t able to intuit why they were here or even grouped up with Urushi to begin with.</p>
<p>「Woof woof woof!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Opening door now.」</p>
<p>We welcomed our four employees inside, only to notice that the strongest of them had sustained an injury. Colbert was walking with a limp, and it didn't even look like he could stand on his own. Judith had to support him in order for him to make it indoors. The cloth wrapped around his left leg was already completely stained in crimson.</p>
<p>Damn. What happened?</p>
<p>「Injured?」</p>
<p>「Please don’t mind me, I’m sorry for appearing before you in such a disgraceful manner. It was a minor blunder.」</p>
<p>「He ended up getting hurt because he protected us.」</p>
<p>「Colbert probably would’ve won if we weren’t there to drag him down.」</p>
<p>「It was all our fault.」</p>
<p>There was no doubting that Colbert was strong. He had high stats, and it was strikingly obvious that he'd honed his technical skills as well. We knew for a fact that he was worthy of his rank. I understand that he had to protect The Scarlet Maidens and all, but still, that was a pretty big injury right there, one that could only have been inflicted by a formidable opponent.</p>
<p>「I happened to have a potion on hand, but its effect was not strong enough to heal all my injuries.」</p>
<p>「His whole foot had been torn off!」</p>
<p>Apparently the injury had been even worse just a bit earlier.</p>
<p>「Urushi saved us.」</p>
<p>「We were in a pretty bad spot, but Urushi managed to drive off the person that attacked us.」</p>
<p>「He appeared from the man’s shadow and executed a well timed sneak attack. It was quite a splendid maneuver.」</p>
<p>「He was really awesome!」</p>
<p>Ahhh, I see now. So that’s why they came back together.</p>
<p>「First, fix injury. Greater Heal.」</p>
<p>「Amazing! My injuries are closing so rapidly that I can see them vanishing before my very eyes.」</p>
<p>「Woah, you’re <i>this</i> good at healing magic too? Just how far ahead of me are you, Magic Sword Girl…? And just how depressed do you want me to be!?」</p>
<p>We had them sit down and explain what’d happened after making sure Colbert had gotten all healed up.</p>
<p>「What happened?」</p>
<p>「Well, it all started when we parted ways at the Chef’s Guild. We were planning to head back to the inn we were staying at.」</p>
<p>「The three of us have been staying there ever since we first started adventuring.」</p>
<p>「I had planned to return to my residence after escorting the girls to theirs. Hence, I had accompanied them.」</p>
<p>Apparently, they were attacked by a gigantic man over two meters tall before reaching their destination. It wasn’t just some random indiscriminate attack either, the man had clearly recognized the girls, as he called out to them before initiating his assault.</p>
<p>「It was clear to that the man’s objective was to eliminate all three members of The Scarlet Maidens.」</p>
<p>「Absolutely sure?」</p>
<p>「Yup. He asked us whether or not we were The Black Tail’s salesgirls.」</p>
<p>「But he actually started attacking before waiting for us to answer.」</p>
<p>「Don’t tell anyone, but seeing him come at us like that almost made me wet myself.」</p>
<p>In other words, the assailant knew what they looked like. He probably knew where they lived too, seeing as how he ambushed them along the way.</p>
<p>「Have any information about enemy?」</p>
<p>「Indeed we do. The man voiced his name as he attacked.」</p>
<p>「Interesting.」</p>
<p>「He called himself Zerrosreed, The Berserker. I’d thought that the rumours had been but mere exaggerations, but I was clearly proven wrong.」</p>
<p>「I think he might actually be stronger than the rumours say he is.」</p>
<p>「Who?」</p>
<p>「Wait, you don’t know who he is? Really, Magic Sword Girl?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The guy was apparently famous, and all four of our companions felt it odd for Fran not to know his name.</p>
<p>「Heheh, then I’ll tell you all about him!」</p>
<p>Lydia quickly went over all the rumours and told us a bunch about the guy.</p>
<p>Apparently, he’d lose the ability to differentiate between enemies and allies the moment he engaged in combat. He even had a bounty on his head because he killed the prince of one of the countries that he was supposed to be working for. Dude sounded dangerous as hell.</p>
<p>The guild ranked him in at C, but rumours had said that his rank didn't do him justice. Everyone present had merely dismissed the rumours as, well, mere rumours, but they’d evidently been shown to be true.</p>
<p>「He was really strong.」</p>
<p>「Urushi’s surprise attack was the only reason he resorted to retreating. As expected, not even a man as powerful as The Berserker could withstand a Darkness Wolf’s ambush.」</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Urushi. Good boy.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Urushi didn’t seem completely content despite being praised. I felt that he was disappointed at the fact that he was unable finish the man off, even though he'd managed to land a sneak attack.</p>
<p>Judith had a bit of an unsettled look on her face, which only made sense given how she was attacked by someone far stronger than her. Crap, we can’t afford to have her quit on us.</p>
<p>I was worried that her party would give up on the task of selling curry bread, but my concerns turned out to be needless. Rather than succumbing to fear, she instead declared in defiance that she wanted to see the job through to the end. Her pride as an adventurer had completely overwhelmed her sense of terror. Colbert acted in a fairly similar manner, and got all fired up; he declared that he would defeat The Berserker next time the two of them crossed paths.</p>
<p>「Then looking forward. Working together tomorrow.」</p>
<p>「Leave it to me!」</p>
<p>「Me too!」</p>
<p>「I’ll do my best.」</p>
<p>「Next time we run into each other, I’m giving that gorilla one hell of a bashing!」</p>
<p>We guided Colbert and the salesgirls over to the place we were staying after confirming their intentions. The district had a plentiful number guards within it, so we figured it would be safe. Initially, we'd planned to let them borrow our room if there weren’t any more available, but the hotel’s staff immediately made us a few arrangements the moment they caught sight of Colbert.</p>
<p>「You’re heading out again, Magic Sword Girl?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Will be back by morning.」</p>
<p>「Wait, wait! Don’t tell me you’re going after him!?」</p>
<p>「No. Going elsewhere.」</p>
<p>「Alright then…」</p>
<p>「It’s too dangerous to go alone!」</p>
<p>「Not alone. Together with Urushi.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「I understand… However, do make sure you return by the morning. We’ll be disqualified if you fail to make it back.」</p>
<p>「Nn. No problem.」</p>
<p>We went back to the kitchen so we could get Urushi to tell us what he’d found.</p>
<p>「Bark bark bark!」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>Urushi tried to relay his message by raising his front legs whilst making dog noises. We were able to get the fact that he was trying to tell us something, and that his message contents were rather urgent. However, we were unable to discern any further detail.</p>
<p>I was ready for this exact situation though. I’d devised a method that could potentially allow him to communicate with us, and so, I explained it to him.</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『You think you can pull it off? Alright, try it on me first.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『Hmm… Yeah, it didn’t work.』</p>
<p>The concept was to use the Level 8 Dark spell Brain Trick. The spell’s effect allowed one to directly implant anything they imagined into their target’s mind and thereby cause hallucinations. It sounded like a spell that would normally fall under the illusion element, but it wasn’t. It counted as dark due to the fact that it would operate directly on the target’s brain. As a result, it was much more difficult to detect than any sort of illusion based magic.</p>
<p>Specifically, the concept was to have Urushi project his memories as opposed to something he imagined. That, in turn, could potentially allow Urushi to communicate with us despite being incapable of speech.</p>
<p>However, it didn’t go as smoothly as I’d assumed it would, probably because I didn’t have a brain for the spell to mess with in the first place.</p>
<p>『Try it on Fran instead.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Ready.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Nn! Can see clearly. Mastermind. Lord’s second son.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>It seemed like it worked. Sweet, communicating with Urushi would be even easier going forward.</p>
<p>Fran explained to me everything Urushi had bore witness to.</p>
<p>『Alright. So, the lord’s second son is the one behind everything.』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>『Never in my wildest dreams would I have ever imagined that we ended up accidentally saving the city.』</p>
<p>「Surprising.」</p>
<p>『But now he’s after us because of it.』</p>
<p>I had to admit that we were a bit outmatched. We had to deal with Waint, Bluke, Zerais, Rynford, and even Zerrosreed The Berserker to top it all off.</p>
<p>We were up against an entire organisation, one that’d already weaved their web. It was going to be tough, especially given how little time we had to deal with them.</p>
<p>I guess it’d help if we were to borrow an organisation’s power as well… though I’m not all that sure that the people I had in mind would actually be willing to help us.</p>
<p>『Let’s go pay the Lord’s manor a quick visit.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>

<p>I didn’t bother differentiating between the girls this time around. Honestly, I don’t even remember which one’s which at this point.</p>
<p>Important Note: Translations <i><b><u>may</u></b></i> undergo a temporary slowdown for approximately two weeks because of recent video game releases.

		<p><b>121. The Lord’s Manor</b></p>
<p>The Lord’s Manor was smack in the middle of town, right where the commercial, residential and noble districts intersected. It was about a five minute trip with Urushi going at top speed.</p>
<p>「Comfortable sensation.」</p>
<p><span id="more-458"></span></p>
<p>Fran narrowed her eyes as she enjoyed the cool night breeze. She normally probably would have found it chilly, but her armour was bestowed with cold resistance, so she found it pleasing instead. [1]</p>
<p>『Thank God it’s night time.』</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>Having Urushi leap through the sky at full speed during the day was a big no. We’d end up standing out way too much for comfort.</p>
<p>『Alright, it looks like we’re here.』</p>
<p>The gate leading up to the manor’s entrance was naturally tightly shut. In front of it stood a pair of guards. They seemed to be actively surveying their surroundings in order to ensure that nothing was off.</p>
<p>『Hmm, what do you think we should do? We’re going to be wanting to see the lord, so, do you want to try and ask the guard for permission, or kinda just like head on inside?』</p>
<p>「Ask guards.」</p>
<p>『Alright, but what if they say no? Cause I’m pretty sure they're going to end up asking us to leave.』</p>
<p>Realistically speaking, the chances of us actually getting an audience were pretty miniscule. We came in the middle of the night without any sort of appointment or prior notice. Moreover, we weren’t all that well known either. Fran was just another D ranked adventurer, and a young girl at that. The only two kinds of people that’d welcome her in this sort of situation were the overly nice and lolicons up to know good.</p>
<p>「Ask Flut and Satia.」</p>
<p>『Fair enough.』</p>
<p>I mean, they did really want us to drop by, but they might've already gone to bed given the time. That said, contacting the Prince and Princess was pretty much the only real card we had to play. Yeahhh, the situation wasn’t exactly what I’d call favourable by any means.</p>
<p>We figured that we’d probably have a better chance if we were a bit more upfront about the whole thing, so we descended at a location a bit further away and approached the gate in as natural a manner as possible. That said, both guards still found it rather strange for a child to be walking over to them at this time of day.</p>
<p>「A kid?」</p>
<p>「At a time like this?」</p>
<p>「Hi.」</p>
<p>「W-What did you need?」</p>
<p>Sweet, it looks like they’re at least going to hear us out instead of just chasing us away right off the bat.</p>
<p>「Came to see acquaintance.」</p>
<p>「Are you sure you didn’t get the wrong place? This here is the Lord’s manor.」</p>
<p>「I’m sure. Acquaintances staying here temporarily.」</p>
<p>「Hahahah. Only members of the nobility ever stay at the Lord’s manor.」</p>
<p>「Alright, that’s enough joking around from you. Go home, kid. It’s late, and you should be in bed.」</p>
<p>The guards were surprisingly good people. They didn’t shout at Fran to try and drive her away, and they even seemed genuinely worried about her.</p>
<p>「Flut and Satia. Should be here. Friends.」</p>
<p>「Flut, Satia? Who?」</p>
<p>「Wait, I’m fairly certain that Flut and Satia are the names of the Fyrias Kingdom’s prince and princess.」</p>
<p>「Oh, yeah, right. But those guys are royalty. There’s no way they’d be friends.」</p>
<p>「Hold on. I do remember them saying that one of their friends might end up paying them a visit, and that we should let said friend through should she come.」</p>
<p>「Ahhh, yeah. I remember now. H-Hey, what was your na – er, would you mind if I asked for your name?」</p>
<p>「Nn? Fran.」</p>
<p>「See, I knew it!」</p>
<p>「P-Please allow some time in order for us to authenticate any necessary details!」</p>
<p>And so, the guards ran around and exchanged information in a bit of a dumbfounded manner in order to confirm Fran’s identity.</p>
<p>The whole process ended up taking about a total of thirty minutes.</p>
<p>「How nice of you to visit!」</p>
<p>「We’re glad to see you again.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Me too.」</p>
<p>「We’ve heard much of your accomplishments. They say your entry in the King of Cooking is a dish completely unknown even to the judges themselves.」</p>
<p>「Our servants have claimed that they were extremely delicious. We really would like to try them ourselves.」</p>
<p>「Then stop by stall?」</p>
<p>「We can’t. We as royalty can’t possibly voice any dissatisfactions about the food Barbra’s lord is providing us. Besides, there’s all that troublesome food taster stuff too.」</p>
<p>Riiiight. Royalty didn’t have the liberty to just walk around in order to buy and eat whatever they wanted. That applied all the more to both Flut and Satia seeing as how they’d only just recently avoided an assassination. Serid, who just happened to be standing by, ended up giving a bit of a frown in response to the the prince’s words.</p>
<p>「Then can just sneak a few. Here.」</p>
<p>「Awesome! So this is the rumoured curry bread?」</p>
<p>「It’s still warm!」</p>
<p>「Paramount of flavour.」</p>
<p>「I-It’s that delicious?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「We’ll gladly accept the offer.」</p>
<p>Flut and Satia happily grabbed the food Fran presented them without even a moment’s hesitation.</p>
<p>Wait, whatever happened to the food taster stuff?</p>
<p>I looked towards Serid, only to find that he actually wasn’t bothering to say or do anything. All he did was keep the same frown on his face. In fact, he, like the prince and princess, also took a serving of the dish when we ended up deciding to offer it to him. He actually just took it without even the slightest bit of suspicion.</p>
<p>It looked like he actually trusted Fran. Though, I guess that did make sense. There was no reason for her to poison anyone present, especially after all they’d been through together.</p>
<p>「It tastes really good!」</p>
<p>The princess was the first to react.</p>
<p>「I think it might be the most delicious thing I’ve ever had!」</p>
<p>「Me too!」</p>
<p>「I do admit that the dish is indeed mortifyingly delicious.」</p>
<p>The fact that all three of them enjoyed it made me feel pretty good about myself. It seemed even royalty was within curry bread’s strike zone.</p>
<p>「Curry is best.」</p>
<p>「That's a claim I'm more than capable of understanding.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran looked at all three of Flut, Satia and Serid with a smug expression on her face. She ended up giving a happy nod each and every single time any of the three said the words "tasty" or "delicious."</p>
<p>『It should be about time for us to get down to business.』</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>Apparently, Fran’d been so happy with everyone’s reactions that she’d completely forgotten why we came here in the first place.</p>
<p>『We paid them a visit because we needed to see the Lord, remember?』</p>
<p>「Right. Accidentally forgot.」</p>
<p>「What’s wrong, Fran?」</p>
<p>「Came to ask a favour.」</p>
<p>「What kind of favour? We’ll try our best to see it through if it’s something we can help you with.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Want to see Barbra’s Lord.」</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「You wanted to see Sir Rhodas? What for?」</p>
<p>「Tomorrow. Coup d’etat.」</p>
<p>「Did you state that there would be a coup d’etat!? Explain to us the details immediately!」</p>
<p>Serid interjected the moment he heard about the the coup.</p>
<p>And so, Fran told the three everything she knew. She described the second son’s treachery, and the third son’s involvement therein while also making mention of the assassinations ordered.</p>
<p>Her explanation led Flut to immediately rise to his feet.</p>
<p>「Serid, I command you to arrange us a meeting with Sir Rhodas immediately.」</p>
<p>「By your will, Your Highness!」</p>
<p>「Believing me?」</p>
<p>It looked to us like the prince had taken Fran’s words to heart; his expression betrayed not even the slightest bit of doubt.</p>
<p>「I do. I know that I can trust you, Fran.」</p>
<p>「The images Urushi showed us looked quite realistic as well.」</p>
<p>「Telling a lie of such a calibur can result in execution, and I hardly take you for such a fool.」</p>
<p>And so, with that said, Serid left the room in order to book us an appointment with the Lord. Flut and Satia were royalty. Their words held quite the weight to them, so much weight, in fact, that the Lord himself came to their room before even five minutes had passed.</p>
<p>「I have come to answer your summons, Your Highnesses?」</p>
<p>「I’d like to introduce you to a friend of ours before we begin our discussions.」</p>
<p>「Fran. Adventurer. Nice to meet you.」</p>
<p>Rhodas was a noble with an incredible amount of power, but he ended shaking Fran’s head with a nod of acknowledgement regardless. It looked to me that he was being as careful as possible to ensure that he kept the Prince and Princess in a good mood. Treating her without respect despite the introduction would likely lead to the opposite of his desired result.</p>
<p>「And I am Rhodas Krysten, Barbra’s Lord. Your Highnesses, did you perhaps call for me in order to allow for this introduction?」</p>
<p>「Unfortunately that’s not all. We’d like for you to listen to what she has to say.」</p>
<p>「I see…? Very well then.」</p>
<p>I had to say, Rhodas was truly an exemplary noble. He was probably overloaded with doubts and questions, but he managed to retain a poker face and his answer only indicated the slightest bit of hesitation. He knew that he was dealing with royalty, and that it’d be best for him to go along with their demands.</p>
<p>「Nn. Here to discuss second and third sons.」</p>
<p>「Are you perhaps referring to Bluke and Waint?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>And so, Fran told Rhodas basically exactly what he’d just told Fyrians. Naturally, not even a noble as accomplished as him could remain calm when told of the fact that his kids were scheming up a coup.</p>
<p>「That’s preposterous! On what sort of ridiculous foundation could you possibly base those claims!?」</p>
<p>He eventually became unable to hold it any longer, and ended up cutting Fran off with a shout.</p>
<p>「The truth.」</p>
<p>「Then you must surely possess evidence!」</p>
<p>He rose from his chair whilst continuing to yell despite the fact that he was still in the presence of royalty.</p>
<p>「Urushi.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「A-And what precisely might you be doing now?」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry Sir Rhodas. No harm will come to you. Please relax.」</p>
<p>「Y-Your Highness, I…」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Ugh… I…」</p>
<p>Seeing Urushi’s memories caused Rhodas to grimace. It didn’t seem like he was willing to what he'd just witnessed.</p>
<p>「What you’ve presented me fails to suffice as evidence… But I highly doubt that a girl as young as yourself would otherwise have knowledge of Zerais’ features… Moreover, it is indeed a fact that this year’s festival has seen many more arrests than any other in the past. 」</p>
<p>He started muttering under his breath while sorting through the details.</p>
<p>「Well, Sir Rhodas? What are your thoughts on the matter?」</p>
<p>「We have yet to see any solid evidence, and as such, I cannot agree to deploying all the city’s troops.」</p>
<p>「I understand your concerns, but the danger posed by a potential coup d’etat should not simply be overlooked.」</p>
<p>「Before we discuss the matter any further, I must ask something of you, Your Highness. Do you trust the words that the young lady before us has said on this day?」</p>
<p>「I have full faith in her.」</p>
<p>「I see…」</p>
<p>The Lord spent a bit of time contemplating the pros and cons of each of his options.</p>
<p>If I were to guess, I’d say that he probably first considered if his sons were trustworthy. The next factor he thought of was likely whether or not listening to the Fyrians was a good move from a political standpoint. They were royalty, but they also hailed from a completely different country. He didn’t necessarily need to heed their words, but, doing so would allow him to build with them a trusting relationship. Moreover, they’d owe him a favour if we were wrong about the whole thing. The last thing he probably ended up debating was if what he’d been shown through magic was something that'd actually happened.</p>
<p>And so, after a few minutes passed, he finally managed to come to a decision.</p>
<p>「I understand the circumstances and will act accordingly. I cannot arrest either of my sons without evidence. However, I will have the guards that normally work throughout the night restrain them whilst claiming to be functioning as escorts. I will also work to increase the number of guards on patrol in order and have them search for both Zerais and Zerrosreed. I will then mobilize an additional unit in order to collect evidence as to not make waste of time.」</p>
<p>「We will contribute our own guards to your forces as well. The more heads we have, the easier the task will be to achieve.」</p>
<p>Honestly, we’d hoped for him to mobilize all his troops in order for him to quickly capture and arrest Bluke and his companions, but that was unrealistic, and what he was now was still sufficient. Besides, the troops Flut and Satia brought along were going to join in as well, so we still had more than enough manpower.</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>「And where, might I inquire, are you headed off to now?」</p>
<p>Rhodas questioned Fran as she rose from her seat. He’d probably assumed that she was just going to sit here and wait until the whole thing was done and over with.</p>
<p>「Finding evidence.」</p>
<p>We figured it’d be a good for us to take either Zerrosreed or Zerais into custody.</p>
<p>『Alright, Urushi. We’re going to be counting on that nose of yours, boy.』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>「Will be back.」</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>[1] Think along the lines of how cats like to narrow their eyes when you pet them sometimes.</p>
<p>I’d expected that I’d end up having to take breaks from both Fire Emblem and Nights of Azure because of the translations typically being really bad for my sanity. I was right. You can thank those two games’ localization teams for today’s release.</p>

		<p><b>122. Of Progress and Sudden Changes in Situation.<br>
</b><br>
Rhodas had hesitated in coming to a decision, but immediately swapped to a series of quick, decisive actions the moment he did. That is, he managed to sortie his troops within the hour.</p>
<p>A part of his rapidity was due to the lack of a need to make any sort of major preparation. He didn’t bother delivering an address. He simply told the guards that they were taking Waint and Bluke into custody, and that was that.</p>
<p>And of course, we ended up having to join them so we could show them to the manor’s location.</p>
<p>『Urushi, can you tell if the lord’s second son is actually there or not right now?』</p>
<p>（Woof!）</p>
<p>『Alright, good.』</p>
<p>It would’ve been a huge pain in the ass to end up not finding the Lord’s second son present even after going out of our way to get what was effectively a warrant for his arrest.</p>
<p>The lord had his troops stand by as soon as they entered sight range of our target. Turned out that he was still indeed hesitating, which, honestly, was pretty fair. He didn’t have any real evidence, the only thing he had to go off of was what he probably thought to be a suspicious girl’s testament. He didn’t know exactly who owned the manor, and thus, could potentially have to end up being liable for any damages caused, especially seeing as he was basically about to have the city’s guards assault it.</p>
<p>In other words, it was up to us to take the initiative.</p>
<p>『Fran.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「W-Whatever are you doing!? Return at once!」</p>
<p>Fran dashed out in front whilst ignoring Rhodas’ protests. Our target was the gatekeeper. We didn’t want to end up having to argue with him, and we figured that getting him talk would probably help convince the Lord that we were in the right.</p>
<p>「Huh?」</p>
<p>I appraised the man and verified that he was not only a criminal, but also afflicted with the whole heart of evil thing. Only after confirming all that did we strike; Fran silenced him by smacking him in the face with her fist.</p>
<p>We then tied him up and gagged him before healing him and waking him up.</p>
<p>「Mrrggphh!」</p>
<p>「Quiet.」</p>
<p>「Mrrggphh!」</p>
<p>Specifically, Fran had woken him up by kicking him hard enough to bend his spine into something that seemed to resemble a "less than" symbol. She then repeated the process until he finally stopped resisting. [1]</p>
<p>Only after that did Rhodas finally approach, several aides in tow.</p>
<p>「A-And what is it that you are doing right now?」</p>
<p>「Nn? Interrogation.」</p>
<p>「It appeared as but mere torture to me… That aside, who precisely is that man?」</p>
<p>「Dunno specifics. Some enemy.」</p>
<p>「And do you possess the evidence to support that claim?」</p>
<p>「Could tell at a glance.」</p>
<p>「Does that not simply mean that you have none whatsoever?」</p>
<p>Rhodas planted his face into his palms as he shook his head back and forth. He didn’t have the ability to use appraisal, so he obviously had no clue that the man was indeed one of our enemies. Thus, he was probably contemplating what he was going to do about this whole situation.</p>
<p>「Will ask questions now. Answer honestly, no more pain. Make a fuss, death.」</p>
<p>Hearing Fran’s words caused the gatekeeper to nod as fast as he could, with his face as pale as could be. He ended up just sitting there, looking at us meekly after we removed his gag.</p>
<p>「This manor. Who is owner?」</p>
<p>「The place is owned by The Eathra Company. I-I’m just a lowly guard, s-so that’s all I know!」</p>
<p>Hmmm, didn’t look like he was lying.</p>
<p>「Eathra Company?」</p>
<p>Dannan, one of Rhodas’ older aides, filled us in on a few details after he happened to catch sight of Fran repeating the unfamiliar name under her breath. Dannan was actually quite the impressive guy. He took on every single chamberlain-esque duty whilst also managing the lord’s domestic affairs. Moreover, he was even about as strong as the average D ranked adventurer. The old man was seriously just a huge bundle of talent.</p>
<p>「The Eathra Company is a subsidiary under Sir Bluke’s Tormayo Corporation. It is known as a rather greedy company, and widely detested as a result.」</p>
<p>The Tormayo Corporation was actually a rather expansive business. It mainly focused around the sale of luxuries to nobles, many of which Bluke would personally introduce to the store. It had so much wealth and influence that not even the Lord himself could really do much to it, at least not openly.</p>
<p>The Eathra Company had The Tormayo Corporation backing them every step of the way, so they were pretty much able to avoid all inspections and audits.</p>
<p>「I recall Sir Bluke stating that he knew little of Tormayo’s subsidiaries as he’d left management of its affairs to one of his retainers……」</p>
<p>Yeaahhhh, no. That was obviously a lie.</p>
<p>「Man named Bluke here?」</p>
<p>「Oh, you’re talkin about the guy that Eathra’s manager keeps bowing to, right? If so, then he’s definitely here. I see him all the time, so I can say fer sure that he went inside a couple hours back.」</p>
<p>「Last question. You, do lots of bad things?」</p>
<p>「Er, well, I…」</p>
<p>「Hmm..」</p>
<p>A loud cracking sound resounded through the night as Fran kicked the man in the back hard enough to cause tears to flow from his eyes.</p>
<p>「I-I’m sorry, I’m sorry! I’ll answer your question, so please, stop already!」</p>
<p>「Then answer. Shouldn't have hesitated in first place.」</p>
<p>「I’ve done lots of bad things. I’ve kidnapped women and dragged em back over. I’ve even done myself some arson when the company was faced with competition.」</p>
<p>The Eathra Company was pretty much made to do all The Tormayo Corporation’s dirty work. In essence, the company basically constituted the corporation’s dark side, but they were positioned in such a manner that they could be cut off with ease if their crimes were to come to light. Under normal conditions, their activities would likely have had remained in the dark due to Bluke's influence, but even so, the company had still gone out of their way to base itself in a location that made it easy for the people involved to cover stuff up.</p>
<p>「And is Bluke aware of all that is going on?」</p>
<p>「I would say that is a reasonable conclusion, given all the factors mentioned.」</p>
<p>Dannan's response to the Lord's question caused him quite a bit of grief.</p>
<p>「I can’t believe it… For Bluke, for my own son to be involved in <i>this</i> line of business…」</p>
<p>Rhodas seemed to be the doting type. Or rather, the type that trusted the members of his family unconditionally.</p>
<p>「People that cross Bluke get it bad. I’ve heard he’s killed a few, and sold a few others off into the illegal slave market.」</p>
<p>「C-Cease with your lies immediately… Bluke would never…」</p>
<p>Rhodas continued to protest, but it seemed that he’d started to doubt his son’s deeds. His tone had lacked its usual strength.</p>
<p>「I deprived him of his right to inherit my rule as a result of the intolerable manner in which he had looked upon the city’s common folk, and I had expected him to repent for his misdeeds as a result…」</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

        </div>
        
<p>「It appears that depriving him of his right to succeed has instead caused him to throw a temper tantrum.」</p>
<p>「That can’t be… Bluke…」</p>
<p>Wait wait, did Dannan just call this a temper tantrum? I'm pretty sure this counts as a bit more than just that. They do realize that he’s trying to kill his older brother and usurp his position, right?</p>
<p>「Very well. I will speak to Bluke myself. The testimony to which I have just born witness suffices as enough evidence to warrant action. Guards, I order you, take all who resist into custody, and if you happen to chance upon Bluke… Arrest him.」</p>
<p>「As you will, my Lord!」</p>
<p>We used the gatekeeper’s key to get ourselves within the building's premises.</p>
<p>We had the sixty person group split in half. Thirty odd troops surrounded the building, whilst the rest infiltrated and performed a raid.</p>
<p>Bluke had a bunch of hgis men stationed within the manor, but they were unable to stand up to the city’s guards. Hence, they were arrested and detained, one after the other. Resisting didn't do them any good.</p>
<p>Appraising them led to the conclusion that every single individual had been afflicted with both the Heart of Evil and Enraged status conditions. Did Bluke have all his subordinates drink the magic-infused water they made? I guess the only way to find out is to ask him ourselves.</p>
<p>We arrived in front of Bluke’s door after about five minutes. Urushi had found him with Presence Detection, so we knew for a fact that he was there.</p>
<p>Fran slammed the door open, only to find the man rummaging through his desk. It looked like he’d realized that something was going on, so he was getting some cash ready in order to ensure his escape.</p>
<p>「N-Name yourself!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Will not give name to criminals.」</p>
<p>「And you believe that you have the right to make such a claim despite trespassing as we speak?」</p>
<p>「Trespassing, she is not, Bluke. Her actions abide perfectly by law, as she is currently in the midst of an investigation with regards to an organization suspected to be engaged in criminal actions.」</p>
<p>「What? Father!? For what reason are you here…?」</p>
<p>「That would be a question I myself would also like to ask. Bluke, for what reason are you within the confines of a criminal organisation?」</p>
<p>「What are you saying, father?」</p>
<p>Bluke started to make an excuse, but I didn’t really care. My attention was directed elsewhere, specifically, at the fact that he was afflicted by the same two status conditions as everyone else in the building.</p>
<p>The hell? Did he drink the magic-infused water he made? That makes no sense. I mean, why would he? And does Enraged have anything to do with the whole Heart of Evil thing? Or are they independent of each other?</p>
<p>A soldier entered the room as I pondered.</p>
<p>「We’ve completed our mission sir. The entire manor is now under our control. We found a few wanted criminals within, but have managed to detain each and every single one. We also came across several young girls believed to be victims of the underground slave market. We’ve taken them into custody for the sake of protection.」</p>
<p>Both the wanted criminals and illegal slaves served to provide indisputable, incriminating evidence. There was no way Bluke could get away with the whole thing by just saying that he didn’t know about it.</p>
<p>「I will listen to all that you have to say once we arrive at the Knights’ Headquarters. However, be aware that I bear not the will to listen to mere excuses.」</p>
<p>「Impossible…! This is impossible! Impossible I say! How did you catch wind of my activities!?」</p>
<p>Did he seriously expect anyone not to notice? Did he think himself an intellectual, and his plan was super solid or something? Like, seriously it was pretty much completely full of holes.</p>
<p>Like, why did he think he could become Barbra’s Lord by making his father step down from his position? If the ordeal was actually so serious that they needed to arrest the Lord for it, then the country definitely wouldn’t have let his family retain any power. Rhodas' whole household would’ve gone down with him.</p>
<p>Oh well, either way, we managed to stop the coup, which was good. All we had to do now was to reduce the number of victims by detaining Waint and preventing him from selling anything his stuff tomorrow.</p>
<p>We could cure the abnormal stats conditions that all the people had by feeding them the Recovery Water we’d made. So yeah, all was fine and dandy.</p>
<p>Or it should’ve been, had Bluke not suddenly started screaming.</p>
<p>「Guhguahhhhh!」</p>
<p>「B-Bluke? What is the matter?」</p>
<p>「Gugugaugagaguaguaguaaaaaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>Bluke’s body began giving a black aura. Okay, yeah that totally didn't look all fine and dandy.</p>
<p>『Fran, have him drink the Water of Recovery.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Urushi, hold down.」</p>
<p>「Bark!」</p>
<p>Urushi held Bluke in position with his front paws as the man convulsed and continued to scream. Fran approached him and tried to pour some of the Water of Recovery out and into his mouth, but he kept moving and refused to drink even a single drop.</p>
<p>「Urushi, turn upside down.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Urushi did as he was told and flipped Bluke over so he had his back against the ground. Fran then finally managed to pry his mouth open and make him down glups of the Water of Recovery.</p>
<p>『Shit, we didn’t make it in time!』</p>
<p>I’d thought that we finally managed to resolve the situation, but I was wrong. Appraising him didn’t result in what I’d expected.</p>

<p>Description: Unknown.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>His status page looked exactly like that of a magic beast’s, and his species totally said he’d turned into some type of evil being. [2] The way his level had reverted back to one almost made it seem like he’d undergone some sort of evolution. That said, his stats were super high for a mere level one’s. He obviously wasn’t as strong as we were, but he probably had the strength to take down a guard.</p>
<p>Good thing he wasn’t an adventurer, or really strong to begin with or anything like that. If that were the case, we probably would’ve been screwed.</p>
<p>「Giggagagagagagaaaaa!」</p>
<p>「Gugagagagagaaa!」</p>
<p>And then, it happened. A series of similar screams resounded from outside the manor’s confines.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>[1] It's this symbol &lt;. This is actually a pretty common description in Japanese novels. More literally, the person is said to be bent into く (hiragana 'ku') shape.</p>

		<p><b>123. Luzerio<br>
</b><br>
Shouts and screams erupted from the building’s exterior as presence detection went off and informed me of a series of enemies.</p>
<p>Shit. It looked like Bluke wasn’t the only one that’d transformed.</p>
<p>「Bluke! Bluke, answer me! Whatever is the matter, Bluke!」</p>
<p><span id="more-480"></span></p>
<p>「Approaching, bad idea.」</p>
<p>「Blu-ugh!」</p>
<p>Rhodas ignored Fran’s warning and tried to approach his son, only to be immediately met with a kick therefrom despite the fact that Urushi was still holding the newly transformed Evil Human down.</p>
<p>「Sir Rhodas! Are you unharmed?」</p>
<p>「W-Worry not. I am fine.」</p>
<p>Rhodas stared blankly in a mix of shock and pain as Dannan helped him back up to his feet.</p>
<p>Naturally, his stare did nothing to halt, or even slow down Bluke’s transformation. The second son’s eyes were dyed a pure, jet black; his pupils almost seemed to disappear entirely. His skin had started to undergo a similar process; every last bit of it was tainted as black as the night itself as his muscles swelled till they bulged to the point of abnormality. Everything about him had changed, save for the features on his face. An eerie, sickening result.</p>
<p>I felt the urge to cut him down immediately, but refrained. His father was watching, and we wished not for Barbra’s lord to resent us.</p>
<p>Besides, there might actually be some way for us to turn him back to normal. Bluke knew tonnes about things areas in which we wanted more knowledge, so having him regain his sanity could potentially allow us to derive from him a fair amount of useful information.</p>
<p>「Guruuuuaaaaaahhh!」</p>
<p>He continued to struggle against his capture. It looked like he’d lost all sense of reasoning, and was unwilling to be detained.</p>
<p>Alright, for the time being, we should try having him drink a bit more of the Water of Recovery to see if it does anything.</p>
<p>And… nope.</p>
<p>Fine. What if we used Anti Curse?</p>
<p>And…. also nope.</p>
<p>Our tests led us to realize that he wasn’t actually in an abnormal state.</p>
<p>Both the Insane and Rampaging states were considered to be his default states, and thus, we weren’t able to get rid of either condition. In other words, we were going to have one hell of a hard time turning him back to normal or taking him in quietly.</p>
<p>『Let’s see if we can make him stop moving around.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Urushi, let go.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>「Stun Bolt.」</p>
<p>「Groooogaaaaa!」</p>
<p>Bluke had tried getting up the moment Urushi let go of him, but Stun Bolt had inflicted him with paralysis. And hence, he was now once again on the ground. He was still conscious, but no longer able to move.</p>
<p>『Alright Urushi, hold him down again. Have him stay there till we tell you otherwise.』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>『Let’s go take care of everything happening in the garden, Fran.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran rushed back into the hallway and leapt through one of the windows that faced the building’s garden, shattering it in the process.</p>
<p>『It looks like everyone that got arrested ended up transforming.』</p>
<p>All ten of the men that taken into custody had ended up breaking out of their bindings as a result of their "evolutions." There were far fewer of them than there were guards, but they still seemed to have the advantage due to their disparately high stats.</p>
<p>「What now? Capture all?」</p>
<p>『Eh… nah. Let’s just kill them. Detaining each and every single one would end up being a huge pain in the ass. Besides, they’re criminals anyways, so they’d probably just end up getting sentenced to death even if we did find out how to turn them back to normal.』</p>
<p>I mean, that’s kinda just what happens to anyone with a hand in a failed coup d’etat.</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>Fran accelerated through the use of Air Jump and used the resulting momentum to immediately cleave one of the Evil Humans in half. I threw in a wind spell and took out a second as she landed.</p>
<p>The captured men had been ruffians to begin with, so they were quite a bit stronger than Bluke. Evolution had turned each into an E or so ranked threat.</p>
<p>That said, they still weren’t anywhere close to being our match; it only took us about three minutes to finish them all off. I was honestly kind of disappointed by the results. They were actually pretty strong. I was expecting to be able to absorb their magic stones and get myself a few points. I was quite interested in all the skills they had too, but it turned out that they didn’t actually have magic stones. Oh well, can’t be helped, I guess.</p>
<p>The guards ended up falling onto their butts in exhaustion the moment they saw the last Evil Human fall.</p>
<p>We knew that they were tired, but, we would have to bother them a bit more. And so, Fran approached a man whose armour seemed a bit flashier than the rest, the guy we presumed was the squad’s chief.</p>
<p>「Hey.」</p>
<p>「Y-Yes? What did you need?」</p>
<p>The chief immediately tensed up and straightened his back as he realized Fran wanted to talk to him. It looked to me like he was feeling a mix of respect and terror for Fran’s strength.</p>
<p>「All the people in the manor accounted for?」</p>
<p>「Yes ma’am. The only other people we found inside are the ladies right over there.」</p>
<p>Following the chief’s line of set led us to a group of young girls, currently huddled up and trembling in fear. Quickly appraising them informed me that there wasn’t really anything wrong with any of them as far as status abnormalities went.</p>
<p>「Zerais, alchemist. Rynford, old man. Both not here?」</p>
<p>「I didn’t catch sight of either of the two.」</p>
<p>I’d assumed that the troops had managed to arrest the two of them, but apparently that wasn’t the case at all. We went around and inspected the faces on all the Evil Humans we killed just to make sure, but we didn’t actually find either of the two.</p>
<p>In other words, Bluke was, in fact, not actually the mastermind behind all this. The real mastermind had somehow caught wind of our actions and escaped. Moreover, he’d even manage to retaliate. Was this whole Evil Human transformation thing time based? Or was it done through some sort of remote controlled device? I couldn’t actually tell which of the two it was, but I could at least say that both would definitely be a pain in the ass to deal with.</p>
<p>Hmm… What now? We could have Urushi try sniffing around in order to track the guy down. We could also potentially search the manor and see if we could find any sort of clue.</p>
<p>（Master.）</p>
<p>『Yeah? What’s up?』</p>
<p>（There.）</p>
<p>Fran pointed to the area lying behind the slaves we’d saved. There, we saw the gatekeeper, still tied up just as he’d been before.</p>
<p>Wait. He didn’t transform? What?</p>
<p>He was currently afflicted with the “Agitated Heart of Evil” status condition. Unlike the other guys though, he didn’t have the enraged thing applied to him. Hmmmm… I guess that means the whole transformation thing is based on the amount of the magic-infused water one ingests? If so, then we were in luck, as it meant that the townsfolk that happened to have the former status abnormality wouldn’t end up transforming.</p>
<p>That said though, we couldn’t just leave the whole situation as it was right now.</p>
<p>We couldn’t actually get any use out of the Lord. He was still in a state of shock as a result of his son transforming into a sort of inhuman monster right before his very eyes. Hence, we decided that it’d be better for us to talk to Dannan instead.</p>
<p>「Understand?」</p>
<p>「Indeed. I see that you were telling the truth, and the situation is looking even worse than initially anticipated.」</p>
<p>We didn’t know exactly how many people were in danger of turning into Evil Humans, but chances were, it was more than just a mere ten or twenty. Moreover, it was fairly probably that they’d end up transforming in highly populated, public areas, which, of course, would lead to one hell of a problem.</p>
<p>「Rally troops.」</p>
<p>「That I will. The situation is nothing short of an emergency, and thus, we are also justified in mobilizing the knights.」</p>
<p>We informed Dannan of the specifics on how to differentiate those that might transform and those that might not.</p>
<p>「I see, so we must use Appraisal and be wary of those that carry the Enraged condition.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I understand. We shall immediately dispatch a request to the Adventurer’s Guild in order to secure several individuals capable of appraisal. Unfortunately, we will not be able to hire nearly as many as is possible. It is important for us to ensure that these events remain unknown to the public.」</p>
<p>Yeahhhh, Rhodas might <i>actually </i>end up having to resign if everything ended up coming to light. It seemed that ideally, he wanted to punish Bluke and Waint behind closed doors, secretly find and heal everyone affected by the abnormal status conditions, and finally somehow manage to catch both Zerais and Rynford.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Would you mind continuing to lend us your strength?」</p>
<p>「Don’t mind. Will chase down alchemist. Zerais.」</p>
<p>「Please and thank you. We will ensure we reward you accordingly.」</p>
<p>「Got it. Will first wander around manor. Searching for clues.」</p>
<p>「Please do. I suspect there to be several hidden rooms given the property’s scale. Be wary of their potential existence.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We had Urushi taken off Bluke-stomping duty, and instead tied the man up super tight before telling the guards to keep an eye on him. We needed our wolf's nose, so we couldn’t have him babysit the Lord’s son forever.</p>
<p>『Alright boy, we’re going to need you sniff around to see if you can find strong traces of Zerais’ scent anywhere. Find everything you can, be it his lab or a secret passageway.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi started wandering the manor whilst putting his sense of smell to work. After wandering around aimlessly for a bit, he finally ended up choosing to descend into the building’s basement. I’d a few suspicions about the building’s underground section, and it turned out that they'd been spot on.</p>
<p>The black wolf ultimately ended up leading us to a doorway.</p>
<p>「Woof bark woof!」</p>
<p>「Can’t feel anyone inside.」</p>
<p>『But I guess this is the place that smells most like him?』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Fran opened the door to find a facility that could only ever be described as a laboratory. It very much reminded me of Jean’s.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but want to grab all the tools left lying around for myself. Most, we could get use out of the, and the rest could fetch us a pretty penny on the market. Unfortunately though, I couldn’t actually grab any of it. The current circumstances more or less dictated that everything here now belonged to the Lord, and thus, taking the items for myself counted as theft. Oh well, we didn’t have the time to grab it all anyways, seeing as how we were stuck chasing Zerais.</p>
<p>『I guess I’ll have to pass it all up…』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>That said, there wasn’t actually too much of value left sitting around. I mean, there were a few potions and the raw materials used therein, but all the stuff here was stuff you could pretty much get anywhere.</p>
<p>I tried looking at a few of the documents he had sitting around, but wasn’t really able to make much sense of them. I was, however, able to discern that none of them contained any information that could potentially assist us in chasing the man down. I was feeling a bit down because of it, but luckily, Urushi wasn’t done just yet.</p>
<p>He sat himself down in front of a bookshelf and started scratching at the wall.</p>
<p>Wait, don’t tell me they actually had a secret escape route installed? Seriously? I moved myself over to Urushi and started to give the wall a good stare, but I couldn’t see any cracks or anything.</p>
<p>I tapped the supposed secret wall and several others with Telekinesis just to compare the sounds. Surely enough, the one right in front of me sounded much more hollow than the rest.</p>
<p>Hmm… but how did the hidden mechanism work? I mean, that bookshelf looked super suspicious, especially if you thought about all the stereotypes that came with this sort of situation. It could be one of the books… but it could also be the wall. Maybe there’s a place to press down somewhere? Man, thinking about all this is actually starting to get decently fun.</p>
<p>「Master? Spotted something?」</p>
<p>『Hmm, well, I’m pretty sure that there’s a hidden passage right here, but I can’t figure out how to open it. Oh, right, you should try figuring out the trick too, Fran. It’s pretty fu-』</p>
<p>「Like this?」</p>
<p>The room was suddenly filled by a loud thump as Fran gave the wall a full forced front kick.</p>
<p>It immediately gave into her strike and revealed the secret passageway despite having been covered in a layer of protective magic.</p>
<p>『Umm… Fran…?』</p>
<p>「One more time.」</p>
<p>She followed the front kick up with a spin kick and applied so much strength that she caused the entire room to start shaking. The wall was unable to sustain the force of the blow, and ended up collapsing and revealing a stairwell.</p>
<p>『Well… Whatever works works, I guess.』</p>
<p>「Nn? Let’s go.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Urushi began leading us down the stairs, and into a large, earthen tunnel. It clearly an escape route, and naturally, it didn’t have any sort of traps built into it.</p>
<p>「Someone’s there.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, I can feel his bloodthirst emanating from all the way over here.』</p>
<p>Crisis Detection kicked itself into action and warned us that whatever we were about to fight was more than just a mere small fry.</p>
<p>『Let’s make sure we’re ready to jump right into battle.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『Urushi, you stay hidden boy.』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>We cautiously advanced for about five minutes before finally reaching an area with about twenty meters of space in every direction. At the center of it all sat the thing that’d been thirsting for blood.</p>
<p>It was a man, one with a gentle looking smile, the sight of which for some odd reason pissed me off to no end.</p>
<p>「You know, I was seriously wonderin what kind of person it’d take to actually find that little escape route of ours. Never in my life would I have guessed it to be a mere little girl.」</p>
<p>「Zerais’ subordinate?」</p>
<p>「Wazzat? You seriously think someone as fuckin awesome as me would serve that gloomy-lookin, pussy ass bitch?」</p>

<p>His titles honestly made him look like a piece of shit. He was even apparently a Servant to the Evil God.</p>
<p>It was a bit different than Bluke’s title, which claimed him to be the Evil God’s Slave. This guy had the exact same title as the kobold we’d fought a few days back. I couldn’t tell the difference between being the God’s slave and servant, and unfortunately, Appraisal wasn’t really helping me as much as I wanted it to be. It just kept spitting out that the title’s description was unknown.</p>
<p>「Then, Zerrosreed’s subordinate?」</p>
<p>「You fuckin kidding me!? You think I’d obey that retarded musclehead?」</p>
<p>It seemed that we’d flipped his switch. It was clear as day that he knew Zerrosreed, but the two didn’t exactly get along.</p>
<p>「Only man I’d ever fuckin serve would be an Evil Arts User like Rynford. And you see, unlike that Zerrosreed retard, I’ve actually got brains, so Rydford trusts me ya know?」</p>
<p>Huh? Evil Arts User? That’s the first real thing we’ve actually learned about the old man. The way things sounded made it seem like he was the real mastermind behind all this.</p>
<p>That said, it seemed that this Rynford guy was real cold hearted. He was totally willing to order his subordinates to throw away their lives just so he could buy himself a bit of time.</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s tie him up and wring him of all he knows.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Kuhahahahaha! You seriously wanna go? Alright, bring it on brat, I’ll make you regret <i>everything.</i>」</p>
<p>Luzerio took up a stance with his spear and readied himself for combat.</p>
					
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>124. Luzerio’s "Trump Card"</b></p>
<p>Fran smashed me into Luzerio’s spear and caused a series of sparks to illuminate the underground space.</p>
<p>She was much more skilled than him, but had to hold back so we could keep him alive for information’s sake. Moreover, he had range on her, and was actually decently strong to begin with. He could match the average C ranked adventurer.</p>
<p><span id="more-486"></span></p>
<p>The combination of all the aforementioned factors led the two to fight roughly on par with one another. Unfortunately for Luzerio though, said abilities had caused him to realize why he still continued to draw breath.</p>
<p>「Fuck! Just die already, you shitty brat!」</p>
<p>「Refuse.」</p>
<p>「Fuck! Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck! How the fuck is a fucking kid strong enough to go even with me!?」</p>
<p>「Stop with denial. Not going even.」</p>
<p>「Shaddappppp!!!!」</p>
<p>He’d probably planned to take his time toying with Fran, but reality had instead grasped his dignity and slapped him in the face with it, for it was she and not he that ended up holding back. The fact that his strikes weren’t even so much as leaving scratches caused him to start screaming in frustration.</p>
<p>It would be in our best interest to wrap this up as quickly as possible so we could chase Rynford down, but his Paralysis Resistance was pretty high level, so I figured we probably wouldn’t be able to get him with Stun Bolt.</p>
<p>『Alright, I’m going to mess him up next time we clash. Try not to kill him if you can.』</p>
<p>（Got it.）</p>
<p>「Just die already mother fuckerrrrr!!!!」</p>
<p>I cast Wind Wall without chanting the moment Luzerio extended his spear in an attempt to get some decent damage in and caused his strike to deviate far from its intended path.</p>
<p>「What!?」</p>
<p>「Opening.」</p>
<p>Fran immediately knocked his weapon aside as I followed up my spell with another.</p>
<p>『Stun Bolt!』</p>
<p>「Garghghg!」</p>
<p>Yeeaaap, I knew he wouldn’t end up getting paralyzed.</p>
<p>「You fucking braaaaughhhh!!」</p>
<p>Stun Bolt didn’t really do anything but make him flinch, so he immediately turned around and reached to grab his spear. However, he was interrupted by Urushi, who promptly leapt out of his shadow and gave one of his legs a good bite.</p>
<p>「Growl!」</p>
<p>「Graahhghghgh!」</p>
<p>His right shank had been completely detached from his body. He promptly lost his balance and fell over while staring at his severed limb with a flabbergasted look on his face.</p>
<p>「…M-My leg! My legggg!!!!」</p>
<p>He glared at both Fran and Urushi whilst grinding his teeth in hatred and rage. It almost looked as if his stare alone could cause some sort of curse.</p>
<p>In spite of that, seeing Fran point her blade at his face caused him him to ultimately give up. He dropped the dagger he’d pulled seemingly out of nowhere, and ended up collapsing in a bit of a slump.</p>
<p>「Want information about Rynford.」</p>
<p>「The fuck you wanna know?」</p>
<p>「Describe.」</p>
<p>「Heh. Rynford is one helluva man. He’s got the ability to give bless people with the Evil God’s power. His lets us junk this shitty human shell we’ve got in so we can ascend and evolve!」</p>
<p>The Evil God’s power, eh? Yeah, Iunno, I wouldn’t really call Bluke’s little change to be an ascension by any means. The hell’s wrong with this guy? He wants to become that kind of reason deprived <i>thing</i> of his own volition? All you can do in that kind of state is rampage about. Yeah, I don’t really get him, or anyone with deviant-like tastes for that matter.</p>
<p>「Rynfords goal?」</p>
<p>「Rynford only has one goal, ultimate power!」</p>
<p>「Nn? Means reviving Evil God?」</p>
<p>My thoughts were more or less the same as Fran’s. I’d assumed that he wanted to revive or unseal the Evil God or something like that.</p>
<p>「Are you retarded? Revivin the Evil God would cause the world to end. You think we just want to die? Hell naw, you can’t kill people or fuck bitches if you ain’t alive.」</p>
<p>So does that mean he’s basically planning to use the Evil God’s power? But how’s he manage that if he’s not a believer?</p>
<p>「Evil God's what his name says he is, a God that rules over Evil. He ain’t got no qualms giving his power to sinful men like me.」</p>
<p>Ah, makes sense. So he’s okay with helping out anyone that’s evil, even if they don’t worship him.</p>
<p>「Rynford, where?」</p>
<p>「He’s already moved to another one of the bases Bluke’s prepped for him.」</p>
<p>「Location?」</p>
<p>「Hahahahahah! You want to know where it is? I’ll tell you where it is. It’s beside the Lord’s manor, right in the center of town. It’s the perfect place for Rynford to channel his magic through the whole ass city of Barbra!」</p>
<p>You know, he sure is being awfully cooperative. Is he retarded or something?</p>
<p>The moment the thought crossed my mind was the moment the ring on his finger broke whilst giving off a pale glow; Ruzerio almost seemed to disapear.</p>
<p>「Gyahahaha! Looks like you let your guard down, brat!」</p>
<p>He reappeared about ten meters away from us. It looked like the ring he’d just used had the ability to be sacrificed in order to allow him to teleport a short distance. After teleporting, the man let loose a painfully loud laugh while pulling out a small container and draining its contents in an instant.</p>
<p>「Y’know why I was willing to talk? S’cause you’ll be dying right here, right now anyways!」</p>
<p>His words were accompanied by the emission of a black aura. He’d entered the same state Bluke had just a bit earlier.</p>
<p>Appraising him led me to observe that he had gained the Enraged status. I was more or less completely certain that the stuff he’d just downed had been some of Rynford’s custom made, magic-infused water. In other words, he’d chosen to turn himself into an evil human. It seemed he really did regard it as some sort of ascension.</p>
<p>The flesh around where his leg was severed even started to bubble as it readied itself to regenerate.</p>
<p>「I’m going to tear you to fucking pieagughgh!」</p>
<p>Annnd denied.</p>
<p>I’d started chanting Short Jump the moment he teleported away. We’d already seen what happened with Bluke, so we didn’t bother letting him do as he pleased. This wasn’t an anime, and there weren’t any awesome special effects that accompanied his transformation, so there wasn’t really any point in watching him as it completed.</p>
<p>Fran firmly grabbed ahold of his jaw the moment she blinked towards him, and held it in such a manner that his mouth stayed open. If she wanted, she probably could’ve just put a bit more strength into her hand and crushed it, but instead, she slammed him into the ground.</p>
<p>「Drink.」</p>
<p>「Gurajksdhgkju8asudghask」</p>
<p>She activated her dimensional storage, and opened it up right in front of her palm in order to force him to drink the Water of Recovery. He wasn’t able to close his mouth or spit it back out, and thus, he ended up ingesting a bunch of it.</p>
<p>「Gaaahhh! Gahahhhhh! Greruaughghg!」</p>
<p>Both his abnormal statuses disappeared; feeling the power drain from his body caused Luzerio to look up at Fran with a surprised, blank expression.</p>
<p>「The fuck… did you do to me!?」</p>
<p>「Fixed status abnormality.」</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「N-No way. No fucking way! W-W-W-What happened to all that overflowing power!? My power!? Fuuuuuuckkkkk!!! I’m going to fucking murder you, you fucking shi-!」</p>
<p>「Hmph.」</p>
<p>Fran threw a textbook worthy right hook and caught him smack in the jaw. Ruzerio immediately toppled over, likely as a result of a concussion.</p>
<p>「Shut up.」</p>
<p>It looked like his shouts had been hurting her eardrums because of how excessively loud they'd been.</p>
<p>『Well, that works I guess.』</p>
<p>What now though? He knew quite a bit, so, we were glad we managed to take him alive, but we were split between dragging him along with us and handing him over to the guards. Luckily, our thoughts were interrupted by a series of rushed footsteps coming from behind us.</p>
<p>「Are you alright?」</p>
<p>The chief guard greeted us as he approached. His timing was impeccable; we quickly handed off both the guy and all the information we got from him.</p>
<p>Or wait, no, hold up. Luzerio was way stronger than the soldiers, so leaving him as is was probably not the best idea.</p>
<p>「Wah!」</p>
<p>I cut off Luzerio’s remaining leg with a quick wind spell. He probably wouldn’t be able to put up a fight with both legs missing, so that was fine I guess. We quickly sealed the wound by healing him, so the only problem was that he’d woken up again as a result of the pain, a problem Fran quickly solved by giving him another concussion.</p>
<p>The chief had let out a bit of cry in response to our actions, which… wasn’t exactly what I’d call favourable. To him, it’d looked as if Fran had been the one to commit all the aforementioned acts of cruelty.</p>
<p>（Don’t mind. Would’ve done if Master didn’t.）</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess it’s a bit too late for me to be worrying about that kinda stuff, seeing as how we’d already scared them earlier anyway.</p>
<p>（Nn. More important. Advance.）</p>
<p>『Yeah, true. We should be focusing on that instead.』</p>
<p>Especially seeing as how we figured out where Rynford went.</p>
<p>Advancing through the underground path ultimately led us to a garden in what looked like an abandoned estate in the noble’s district. I’d hoped that we’d end up right inside the hideout, but unfortunately, things didn’t always go that well. The place we were right now wasn’t <i>right</i> next to the Lord’s manor, in fact, it was a decent distance away, but you could see the city’s centerpoint if you tried.</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s do this.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>『What is it boy?』</p>
<p>「Woof woof woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi looked like he wanted to head in a direction opposite that of the Lord’s manor.</p>
<p>『Is that where your nose is telling you Zerais is?』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>So does that mean Zerais and Rynford split up so they could each do their own thing? Or was the hideout Luzerio talked about fake all along? He wasn’t lying, but he could’ve ultimately been fed false info just so he could function as a sacrificial pawn when caught.</p>
<p>『Hmm… What do… Do we trust what Luzerio told us, or go after Zerais…?』</p>
<p>In this sort of situation, it’d probably be best for us to pursue the path that led to the greatest degree of certainty. We could always track Zerais down whenever because of Urushi’s nose, so there wasn’t any harm in giving Rynford’s supposed facts a quick check or two.</p>
<p>『Let’s head into the noble’s district for now. We’ll hunt Rynford down first.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Urushi used Air Jump in order to allow us to make a beeline for the Lord’s manor. Looking down allowed us to see the knights as they ran around the city doing everything they needed to; it looked like Dannan had actually managed to get his job done.</p>
<p>An ear splitting scream soon interrupted our travels; looking down caused us to see a woman being assaulted by what almost looked like a buff, black skinned Daruma, an Evil Human. [1]</p>
<p>We were in a rush, but not so much of one that we’d leave victims to their fates.</p>
<p>「Urushi.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi dove straight at the Evil Human and allowed Fran to slash at its neck as she passed it by.</p>
<p>But it didn’t die. Its head remained unsevered.</p>
<p>「Gruruooohhhh!」</p>
<p>It’d actually managed to realize that we were coming, so it’d raised its arms and sacrificed them to save its life.<br>

_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Huh, this one’s pretty strong. Did it used to be an adventurer or something? It looked like it even still had some of its old skills. In other words, my suspicions were spot on, the stronger the human, the stronger the resulting Evil Human.</p>
<p>Hmmm… That said, I do feel like I’ve seen the guy somewhere before. Where was it again…?</p>
<p>（Adventurer. Kicked up fuss at stall.）</p>
<p>『Oh, right! Yeah, I remember him now.』</p>
<p>He’d caused some trouble at our stall, so Colbert had kicked his ass. He used to be… an F ranker, but now he’d become as strong as a D ranker. Wow. That transformation really did some work.</p>
<p>Still though, we didn’t really have any trouble dealing him; Fran’s second strike split him right down the middle. Blood and other bodily fluids splurted from his muscled corpse as it fell apart from the seams.</p>
<p>「Hiiiiiiihhhh!」</p>
<p>The woman we saved had gone pale because the demonic-looking corpse had fallen right in front her, but she somehow managed to squeeze out a word of thanks.</p>
<p>「T-Thank you very much f-for saving my life.」</p>
<p>Crap… What now? We couldn’t really just leave her here, there might be more Evil Humans about.</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Huh? Kyaah!」</p>
<p>「Bear with it. Just a little.」</p>
<p>Fran lifted her up and hopped on top of Urushi’s back before immediately having him accelerate to where we saw the knights. The woman began to scream, but we couldn’t really blame her.</p>
<p>「Kyaaaaahhhhhh!!!!」</p>
<p>I mean, who wouldn’t scream if a three meter tall wolf popped up in front of them and started carrying them off at super high speed?</p>
<p>「Kyaaaaahhhhhh!!!!」</p>
<p>Hopefully, this wouldn’t end up leaving her with any sort of trauma. Hopefully.</p>

		<p><b>125. Rynford<br>
</b></p>
<p>「Very well, we shall take the lady into our care.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「We thank you for your services.」</p>
<p><span id="more-499"></span></p>
<p>「Thank you so much Fran! You saved my life!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Bye.」</p>
<p>「Take care of yourself out there!」</p>
<p>The woman we helped was much more composed now than she’d been just five minutes prior. Having Urushi leap through the sky with her on his back ended up delivering to her a bit too much of a shock, so we’d descended instead. In spite of that, the atmosphere had ended up being a bit weird throughout the trip’s duration. She ended up tightly clinging to his fur, and continued to do so until it had finally come time for us to part.</p>
<p>We ended up having the knights tell us a bit about everything they knew as we dropped her off. It seemed that the whole situation had actually turned into quite the big deal. A bunch of pretty important places were already under attack. We had to hit the gas if we wanted to get everything under control.</p>
<p>『I think I see it.』</p>
<p>「There?」</p>
<p>We positioned ourselves above the Lord’s manor and surveyed its surroundings.</p>
<p>The Lord’s property was vast. It contained ten different mansions, but in spite of that, we were immediately able to distinguish our target from its peers. The atmosphere around the building in question seemed much heavier than any other around it. We felt a powerful aura from it, one that was quite similar to that of the Evil Beings we’d recently defeated. It was dark, and clearly wicked in nature. That, however, was where the similarities ended. The aura before us was on a completely different scale, it was so powerful that staring at the building from which it came seemed had started to give me goosebumps in spite of the distance between it and us.</p>
<p>Both Fran and Urushi started the place down, scowls plastered all over their faces.</p>
<p>『That’s definitely it.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>I was honestly kind of tempted to just go charging in through the front door, but we knew far too little about our enemies for that to work, so we fell back on our usual stealth-based tactics.</p>
<p>We minimized our presences as we descended into the mansion’s garden. The place lacked any sort of barrier, so infiltration turned out to be rather simple.</p>
<p>『We’ll do the usual and whittle their numbers down bit by bit.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>We started by circling around the place so we could scout out the number of enemies we’d have to take down.</p>
<p>The process took around ten minutes, and informed us of the fact that the building didn’t actually contain that many people. Moreover, all ten or so individuals we detected had gathered at the building’s centermost area.</p>
<p>That, however, was all we could figure out. It didn’t look like we had any other choice but to break in to the mansion's premises in order to get a bit of a better grasp of what was going on.</p>
<p>Oh well, whatever works, I guess.</p>
<p>『Get yourselves ready for combat. A fight could start at any time now.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>I had Fran and Urushi each down a Mana Potion in order to top off their magical energy levels. Fran ended up wielding Deathgaze over me this time around, as I was getting myself ready to shoot off a telekinetic catapult if need be.</p>
<p>And so, we entered the building. Apparently, no one noticed us break through its back door.</p>
<p>We held our breaths as we slowly moved towards the place from which we were detecting the building’s temporary inhabitants. The air seemed to be pumped full of mana, it was almost like we’d entered a haunt. Chances were, the change in atmosphere was one caused by some sort of magic item.</p>
<p>Not a single enemy attacked us on our way. We arrived at our destination with so little trouble that I honestly ended up feeling more disappointed than anything.</p>
<p>（Master. Door.）</p>
<p>『Yeah. It looks like all our enemies are on the other side of it.』</p>
<p>I could feel our enemies from beyond the large double doors before us. It seemed that the other side contained some sort of hall-like structure. The proximity we had to our foes led us to analyze them in more detail. Said process of feeling out their magical energies led us to the definite conclusion that what awaited us was a group of Evil Humans.</p>
<p>Recognizing our foes but led to a single question: what now? They hadn’t bothered to put themselves on guard. In other words, they were extremely confident in their own prowess. Hence, I didn't barge in immediately. It went without saying that I strongly prefered avoiding the any choices that could potentially lead to us waltzing in on a bunch of ridiculously strong foes far out of our league.</p>
<p>Our enemy was capable enough to make people like Zerrosreed and Luzerio into his subordinates. It was very plausible for him to have a bunch of other C or D ranked minions at his disposal. We’d end up in quite the bad spot if we were attacked by a large group of transformed humans formerly of such a caliber. I didn’t think we’d win unless we managed to catch them off guard and blast them all with a bunch of full powered spells at once.</p>
<p>However, I doubted that such a strategy would allow us to capture Rynford alive, especially if we were going all out. I really did want to get ahold of him without actually murdering him for informations sake though… I mean, we could always just attack everywhere except for where he was. Would that work, or…?</p>
<p>（What now?）</p>
<p>（Woof?）</p>
<p>Nah, scratch that. It was possible for Fran and Urushi to end up sustaining major, and potentially even irreparable injuries if we tried to hold back. Their safety was my number one priority. No way in hell I was going to bet their lives for the sake of keeping some shitty old geezer away from his grave. Besides, leaving him alive might end up completely screwing us over if we messed up. It was not only possible, but likely for him to try to destroy the city immediately, should he escape our grasp.</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s get in there and hit everyone with everything we’ve got.』</p>
<p>（Certain?）</p>
<p>『Yeah. We don’t even know whether that Rynford guy’s really here or not to begin with, and he might end up getting away even if he is here, so we’d best finish him off before he messes even more shit up.』</p>
<p>Sorry Rynford, but you’re a dead man.</p>
<p>『Anyways, let’s get a move on.』</p>
<p>（Nn.）</p>
<p>（Growl!）</p>
<p>The room shook as Fran kicked down its door and started firing off her spells. Only after we started attacking did I look around in order to ensure that all our targets were in fact Evil Humans — which, fortunately, they were, especially seeing as how we couldn’t actually stop the attacks we’d already launched.</p>
<p>『Exploding Flare! Hazardous Gale! Exploding Flare!』</p>
<p>I felt a vague bit of nostalgia as I cranked out a series of full powered blasts for the first time in a long while; I overboosted my attacks whilst using Parallel Processing and Sorcery in order to bombard an incredibly large area without much delay.</p>
<p>The Level 4 Flame Spell, Exploding Flare, was one that incinerated a massive area. The use of a wind spell allowed us to increase the size of its explosions even further.</p>
<p>「Fire Wall!」</p>
<p>「Groooowll!」</p>
<p>『Stone Wall!』</p>
<p>I’d used the combination at too close a range, so we ended up getting hit by a bit of the resulting hot air, but Fran managed to get out unscathed by using the defensive spells she’d chanted in advance. Exploding Flare was ridiculously powerful; its aftermath seemed equivalent to that of a napalm blast's. Both sides of the room had its walls get completely blown away. Even we felt like we were about to get sent flying despite the three layers of protection we had.</p>
<p>『Did we end up going overboard?』</p>
<p>「Better than opposite.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>The building’s second floor was basically completely gone by the time the explosions finally settled down. The first had ended up half collapsed as well. Of all the areas encompassed by our strikes, the most damaged was obviously the hall in which the Evil Humans had been gathered up in. All four of its walls had been completely obliterated. Its newfound, exposed appearance almost made me think that the place was instead supposed to have been a courtyard, the courtyard of a building that took up the Lord's entire Marquis-sized property, that is.</p>

<p>「Hmm… Your status and demonstrated abilities seem a bit disparate. Were you using some sort of magic item?」</p>
<p>Holy shit. He’s completely unharmed even after all that? Luckily, he was the only one in such a state. Seven Evil Humans were piled up in front of the short, aging man. The three in front had basically been completely obliterated; little was left of their corpses. The four in the back were a bit better off, but they still looked somewhere in the medium to well done range.</p>
<p>There were three more Evil Humans beyond the pile of corpses. They ended up taking a bit less damage because they’d used their allies as meat shields, but, they weren’t exactly what you’d call in a decent state either. One was going to die in a minute or so regardless of what was done to him. The other two could potentially be saved were they to be treated, potentially being the key word.</p>
<p>Rynford had clearly used his subordinates as to defend against our bombardment. I’d assumed that they were capable of nothing more than just running amok on a sort of rampage, but it seemed that he could order them around somehow. Well, I guess that did make sense seeing as how he was a Master of Evil Arts.</p>
<p>Or, so I thought, but apparently I was wrong.</p>
<p>「M-Master Rynford! Please retreat!」</p>
<p>「We’ll hold them off!」</p>
<p>Much to my surprise, the Evil Humans were speaking much in the same manner as well… regular humans.</p>
<p>I quickly appraised them, only to discover that they were quite different from all the other members of their species that we’d run into thus far. First and foremost was the fact that they actually had their own names. They also weren’t affected by any of the status conditions shared by their peers. Last but not least was the fact that their titles claimed them to be the Evil God’s servants as opposed to his slaves.</p>
<p>So in other words, they managed to become Evil Humans whilst also retaining their sanity?</p>
<p>「Those. Can speak?」</p>
<p>「I guess you ran into some other Evil Humans in town then. The men here are unlike the mongrels thrashing about within the city’s confines. They became Evil Humans by seeking out our Lord’s, the Evil God’s, grace on their own accord.」</p>
<p>Oh, I get it now. So it really was the title that differentiated the two types. The slaves were the ones that’d been forced into a transformation whilst also being deprived of their reason, whereas the servants were the ones that accepted the Evil God’s power as their own.</p>
<p>Luzerio had a title saying he was a Servant to the Evil God, so he probably would’ve retained his sanity as well then. Whew, thank God we got rid of him before he actually finished transforming.</p>
<p>「Conditions for transformation?」</p>
<p>「Normally, I would have asked why you’d assume that I’d tell you that, but I might as well provide you a reward for making it all the way here.」</p>
<p>「Enough with superfluous speech.」</p>
<p>「How assertive you are for a mere girl, but fine. It is actually very easy for anyone to evolve into an Evil Being if they so wish it. All one must do is drink the Evil God’s Magical Water that I happen to be able to create. After that, all that must be done is for me give them a little bit of a push. That’s it. Simple, right?」</p>
<p>Very simple. Too simple, in fact. Is that seriously all it takes for a human to turn into some sort of Evil Being? There would probably be more of them if that were really the case. I’m pretty sure Rynford isn’t the only Master of Evil Arts out there, so if it really were that easy, then there would at least be a bit more awareness of the topic. That, however, didn't seem to be case given the fact that neither Rhodas nor Dannan seemed to know much about the phenomenon at all. In other words, the concept of Evil Beings wasn’t actually all that wide spread. It simply couldn’t have been. Hence, transformation just had to have some sort of additional condition attached to it. There was no way it was actually just that simple.</p>
<p>Rynford was hiding something, and that something was probably related to why was here in the first place.</p>
<p>What was it that Luzerio said again? Something about pouring magical energy into the city’s center so it could spread throughout its entirety? What exactly does pouring magical energy into the city do?</p>
<p>I looked at the area behind Rynford, only to see something that made me feel a bit… off. It was quite difficult to spot at first glance, but he’d drawn a magic circle onto the floor.</p>
<p>Through the use of the Sorcery skill, I managed to trace its energy flow. It seemed to be taking in Rynford’s evil-tainted magical energy and dispersing it. In other words, it was doing exactly as Luzerio described, it was spreading his magical energy throughout the city. The manner in which it was placed made the whole thing almost seem like a ritual of sort, and said ritual was probably that whole last push that Rynford had mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>「Your little display was quite interesting, girl. How about it? Would you like to subordinate yourself to me? I’ll grant far more power than you have now.」</p>
<p>「Your goal…?」</p>
<p>「Wonderful, what a quick reply! I see that you’re still acting quite prudent, but that’s a good thing in and of itself. Very well, I will tell you my goal. My goal is to revive our saviour, The Evil God, and obliterate all that this world has to offer!」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>「Is probably what you’d think, right?」</p>
<p>Rynford went on to repeat basically exactly what Luzerio had said. His goal was not to revive the Evil God, but instead, to spread its divine might throughout the land.</p>
<p>He had no interest in any goals stemming from sources akin to excessive religious zealotry; he didn’t intend on destroying the world or plunging all its citizens into despair for the sake of his God’s glory.</p>
<p>「Well? How about it? I will give you all the power you seek if you choose the path of subordination. I can even provide you an evolution, though it will be one that slightly deviates from the norm.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Declined. Won’t become subordinate.」</p>
<p>「Are you sure? You willfully turn down evolution despite being a member of the black cat tribe, the tribe whose members are said to be unable to naturally evolve?」</p>
<p>「Nn? Demand explanation.」</p>
<p>「I recall hearing that your tribe was long abandoned by God, and thus, lost its ability to evolve. I can’t speak for the claim’s authenticity, but that’s what they say.」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>「I’ve the ability to allow you an evolution, and an immediate one, at that.」</p>
<p>Rynford offered Fran one of his old, wrinkled hands as a wide grin spread itself across his face.</p>
					
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>126. Temple<br>
</b></p>
<p>「I’ve the ability to allow you an evolution, and an immediate one, at that.」</p>
<p>『It’d probably be a good idea for us to play along a bit in order to get him to tell us a bit more.』</p>
<p><span id="more-510"></span></p>
<p>The Principality of Falsehood would allow us the ability to discern the truth from lies, so listening to him a bit longer wouldn’t really result in any sort of harm. That said, his comment regarding the Black Cat Tribe’s ability to evolve meant that evolving as a Black Catsman probably had some sort of trick to it. This was a chance for us to learn a bit more about the process, so, the risk was well worth it, at least in my eyes.</p>
<p>（Information already sufficient. His evolution not true evolution. Involves transformation into Evil Being.）</p>
<p>『True.』</p>
<p>（Won’t lower head to man like this. Not even as act.）</p>
<p>『Ah, I getcha.』</p>
<p>Alright, yeah. Fran's choice was definitely the better of the two choices. Rynford thought his words to be the truth, but there was no way for us to determine the correctness of the information he provided. Not everything he thought to be true really would be true, after all. Moreover, we had no idea what he’d end up doing should we show him some sort of opening. Playing along wasn't exactly what you could call perfectly safe.</p>
<p>「Nn. Can just force information from him later.」</p>
<p>Fran pulled tightened her grip on me as she got herself into a combat ready stance.</p>
<p>「Oh? So you choose not to obey? Fine. I’ll just defeat you and force you into a transformation.」</p>
<p>「Impossible.」</p>
<p>「Fuofuofuofuo! Your words appear much sharper than your skills. I assume you possess some sort of trump card, but I assure you that the magic tool you just used will be insufficient if you wish to defeat me.」</p>
<p>Ah, right, he had Appraisal. He must’ve seen Fran’s fake stats, and thought her to be far too weak to defeat him. He’d likely feel different if he ended up seeing her real stats. I guess that was technically the whole point of using the skill in the first place though, so yeah.</p>
<p>『Welp, his fault, not ours.』</p>
<p>I activated my telekinetic catapult and launched myself right at him. There were only ten meters between us, so my flight but lasted for an instant.</p>
<p>But I was unable to impale the old man.</p>
<p>「That’s a formidable magic sword you have there. Still, it lacks the power needed to pierce the divine protection bestowed upon me by the Evil God himself.」</p>
<p>I was stopped and sent flying by some sort of ridiculously powerful protective barrier. I hadn't gone all out because I didn’t use Overboost, but I hadn’t really held back either. He’d actually managed to block an attack that made use of element enhancements, Poison Fang, and Vibration Blade.</p>
<p>Shit. I ended flying a bit too far. There was quite a bit of distance between Fran and I.</p>
<p>（Master, Urushi. Stay at current location.）</p>
<p>『Alright. I’ll sit around and peek at his skills to see if I can figure anything out.』</p>
<p>（Nn.）</p>
<p>（Woof.）</p>
<p>「How close. You would have been able to interrupt the ritual had you killed me with that blow. That said, delaying its completion for another ten minutes would be all your interruption would've managed, for not even my death can stop the gears I’ve set into motion!」</p>
<p>「Ritual?」</p>
<p>「Fuofuofuofuo! It doesn't matter how much information you pry from me! It's far too late! The ritual has already reached a state of completion!.」</p>
<p>The magic circle Rynford had hidden behind him began to shine with a blindingly bright light the moment he made his declaration. Magical power started flooding out from within it and scattering into our surroundings.</p>
<p>「With this, the city will give rise to an additional 330 of the Evil God’s Slaves! I’d originally planned for a number ten times that, but, all is fine. Zerais’ plans will more than compensate for what we lack.」</p>
<p>I knew he was using that magic circle for something! That said, I was too late to do anything about it. He’d already used it to transform everyone he could into Evil Humans.</p>
<p>「And with that, I’ll be taking my leave.」</p>
<p>「Wait!」</p>
<p>Fran whipped Deathgaze at the old man, but it ended up getting repelled.</p>
<p>「Fuofuofuo. What a weak throw. I see that I was correct in assuming that most of your abilities stemmed from the sword you had. Well, I don’t quite care either way. Men, apprehend her. Kill her if she resists.」</p>
<p>「Yessir.」</p>
<p>The two remaining Evil Humans had somehow managed to recover from their critical injuries. Both now semi-healthy specimens turned towards Fran after acknowledging their master’s orders.</p>
<p>「Don’t be struggling now, if you want to live that is.」</p>
<p>「Dedicate yourself to Master Rynford’s service.」</p>
<p>「I am inclined to forgive you if you do as any good girl and beg for your life.」</p>
<p>They were looking down on us, which did make sense given that we’d disguised Fran’s stats in order for her to seem like any other D ranked adventurer. Numerically speaking, she appeared to Rynford as someone far inferior to both of the Evil Humans before her.</p>
<p>「Absolute refusal.」</p>
<p>「Then die. Farewell, girlie.」</p>
<p>Rynford disappeared as he finished making that one last statement. Shit! Did he teleport somewhere? Evil Arts users could do that? God fucking damn it! I can’t believe he actually managed to get away!</p>
<p>「Prepare to die, brat!」</p>
<p>「We’ll have you pay for wronging Master Rynford!」</p>
<p>Their words were accompanied by a series of twisting expressions, not out of cruelty, but because Fran had killed one of them in an instant.</p>
<p>「T-That’s impossible! Where the hell did that sword come from!?」</p>
<p>The answer was obvious, the weapon she now held in her hands was one she'd procured from her dimensional storage. Specifically, she'd pulled out a blade that hadn’t seen much use in quite a while, the magic sword Phantom Pyroxene.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>Rynford’s other minion was also disposed of in an instant. There wasn’t any trading of blows. The events that transpired failed to amount to anything that even possibly be considered a battle. Fran had simply eliminated her foes. That was it. Her advantage over them was clear, she surpassed them both numerically, and in terms of the number and overall quality of her skills. Her superiority, combined with the fact that her opponents had been off guard, had allowed her to slay them without so much as batting an eyelash.</p>
<p>『It’d probably be a good idea for you to get rid of the magic circle too.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>Rynford had mentioned something about Zerais, so chances were, the two were in the midst of joining up. In other words, Urushi would be able to track both of them down for us at once.</p>
<p>We left the building after casting a few spells to blow the magic circle up. Barbra was bustling with noise as a result of the old man’s actions. Screams were coming from all over the city. The port was giving off a bright red glow; it had obviously been set aflame, a result that almost seemed natural given that three hundred odd Evil Humans had been let loose.</p>
<p>There simply wasn’t enough time for us to fix everything ourselves. We had no choice but to hope that the knights would succeed in the completion of their duties.</p>
<p>『Let’s chase Rynford down.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>Again, that didn’t mean we ignored everything and just singlemindedly charged towards our destination. We still stopped to eliminate whatever enemies we happened to encounter on our way there. All the aforementioned enemies had ended up being forced into their transformations, and so not a single one of them had managed to retain a sane state of mind.</p>
<p>Seeing the Evil Human’s rampaging about had honestly made us feel a bit hesitant about leaving most of them as is, but Rynford and Zerais were probably plotting something to make this whole ordeal even worse than it already was, so we still ended choosing to pursue them instead.</p>
<p>『Take the route that'll get us to where Zeras and Rynford are fastest.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>We managed to reach the source of Rynford’s scent about twenty odd minutes later. The trip had resulted in us butchering three additional Evil Humans along the way.</p>
<p>『You sure it’s here?』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>There didn’t seem to be much magical energy leaking from the building’s premises, and we weren’t able to sense any presences inside of it either. But I trusted Urushi's nose. If he said that this was the place, then it probably was.</p>
<p>『Why a temple of all places?』</p>
<p>The place that Urushi had led us to was, without a doubt, a place of worship, a house of God.</p>
<p>This world’s religious practice wasn’t one segregated by different sects or cults. Every single temple was dedicated to every single God. People of certain races and occupations might end up having greater dedication to one God than the rest, but it’d never be by a large margin.</p>
<p>All in all, the church was a simple, powerless organisation. It never named any particular popes or pontiffs. This was the result of the people believing it forbidden to use the Gods’ names in self interest. It was said that anyone that did commit such a taboo would soon meet fate in the form of death. That, to me, seemed like nothing but just another urban legend, however, this world's denizens apparently believed it to be true. I couldn’t help but feel as if applying such an axiom to the religious organisations we had back on Earth would result in about eighty percent of their staff getting wiped out.</p>
<p>There was a sort of Priest-like position, but it wasn’t anything special. Priests were just responsible for managing their temples, and that was it. Anyone could become a priest so long as they had the Oracle skill.</p>
<p>Job classes could actually be considered one of the Gods’ blessings, and thus, one could change their job at any given temple simply by offering a prayer. Each prayer would come with a three thousand Golde fee in order for the temple to pay its maintenance costs and keep its priests out of poverty.</p>
<p>One could also change jobs at the Adventurer’s Guild, as Fran had done twice already in the past. The reason for that was because the guild possessed a magic item that happened to have said ability. I’d assumed that said item was considered a blasphemy or something, but apparently, all the second hand information I’d obtained said that it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Anyways, enough digressing. All that aside, a temple was still a temple. It only made sense for the Gods’ Divine Protection to prevent anything less than desirable from entering its grounds.</p>
<p>So, given that, how the hell did Rynford managed to worm his way inside? The guy was totally connected to the Evil God. No doubts there whatsoever.</p>
<p>『Just what the hell is going on here…?』</p>
<p>「Will know once inside.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『T-True, I guess…』</p>
<p>We killed our presences as we approached the building. There weren’t any back doors, and the windows were too small to climb through, even for Fran. They’d only been constructed for the sake of letting light into the building's interior.</p>
<p>Peeking through the windows didn’t reward us with any clues either. That said, we did manage to sense a slight big of magical energy.</p>
<p>『I can feel a blatant evil energy in this magic, so it’s gotta be him… But still, why the temple?』</p>
<p>We’d never entered any temples ourselves, but we’d passed by a few on occasion. The magic that we’d felt on all those occasions had been pure. What we were feeling here was far too sinister to be of the same make.</p>
<p>Looks like we’re going to have to break in, I guess…</p>
<p>『Alright… Let’s go.』</p>
<p>We steeled ourselves as we gave the door a gentle push and made our way inside.</p>
					
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>127. A Battle Within the Temple<br>
</b><br>
We steeled ourselves as we gave the temple's door a gentle push and got ready to make our way inside.</p>
<p>（Person sighted.）</p>
<p>Peeking through the resulting crevice allowed our eyes to catch a figure within the building’s deepest depths. The temple was dark, but we were able to make out the small framed individual regardless.</p>
<p><span id="more-519"></span></p>
<p>『Yup, that’s definitely Rynford.』</p>
<p>（Woof woof!）</p>
<p>He’d yet to notice us. The old man had probably never in his wildest dreams imagined that we would be so quick in chasing him down. It looked like we were going to be able to blindside him again, but we were going to have to mix up our method of attack. The whole fire and wind based thing we had going earlier was a fairly solid tactic, but it wasn't applicable given the strength of his protective barrier. I also held the sneaking suspicion that destroying the temple wasn’t exactly the best course of action. The Gods probably wouldn’t be so happy with us if we did. There was a chance that they might not consider Rynford's evil deeds as something of enough note to counterbalance completely blowing up one of their places of worship.</p>
<p>That said though, we couldn’t just wait for him to leave or anything. Who knew what he’d do if left to his own devices?</p>
<p>Besides, our eyes had managed to catch themselves a little something of interest.</p>
<p>『Those crystal thingies he’s got are looking pretty suspicious.』</p>
<p>（Nn. Definitely of value.）</p>
<p>Three massive crystals sat around Rynford, each giving off an evil, bluish purple glow. They were probably why the temple’s energies seemed so off and misaligned.</p>
<p>『You two focus on the crystals. I’ll get Rynford.』</p>
<p>（Got it.）</p>
<p>（Bork!）</p>
<p>（Master.）</p>
<p>『What’s up?』</p>
<p>（No holding back. Will kill him. Here and now.）<br>
『You sure? He might be able to give you some info on evolution.』</p>
<p>（I’m sure. Master promised, will make me evolve. So, will definitely evolve some day. Won’t need to rely on information from him.）</p>
<p>Right. I did tell her that when we first met. I’m glad she remembers, and that she trusts me so much… I-It’s not like I’m moved or anything! Whatever! Who cares! Either way, my motivation’s hit its peak.</p>
<p>『Yeah, you’re right. I’ll definitely make sure you evolve.」</p>
<p>（Nn.）</p>
<p>（Woof woof!）</p>
<p>『See, even Urushi says he’ll help you out.』</p>
<p>（Thanks.）</p>
<p>（Ruff!）</p>
<p>『So yeah, let’s do this. Short Jump!』</p>
<p>I teleported myself above Rynford, charged up my Telekinetic Catapult and launched myself towards him.</p>
<p>「Nuasdhf!? What the!?」</p>
<p>I had totally just rammed him from his blind spot, and his surprised reaction gave way to the fact that he hadn't picked up on the attack in advance. In other words, his barrier was the automatic type.</p>
<p>「You again, girl!? How did you manage to…」</p>
<p>Rynford had started shouting at Fran out of surprise, but both she and Urushi ignored him and went straight for the massive ass crystals.</p>
<p>「Shit! What’s with this damn sword!? It’s keeping me from moving!」</p>
<p>Oh? Did I just hear what I thought I heard? So he can’t move while his barrier’s out? Good to know, good to know.</p>
<p>I continued to use Telekinesis to push myself against his barrier in order to stop both myself from flying away and him from moving. The act was even draining his mana as a bit of an added bonus.</p>
<p>「Evil Smash!」</p>
<p>Rynford fired a spell in Fran and Urushi’s direction. Surprisingly, it passed right through his barrier. Holy crap though, that barrier was hella amazing. It activated on its own, was strong enough to repel my Telekinetic Catapult, and even allowed attacks that came from inside of it to fly out. Not being able to move was honestly pretty fair as far as compensation went.</p>
<p>The old man had fired thirty odd projectiles in the pair’s direction, but neither of the two had gotten hit. There was simply no way in hell either Fran or Urushi would be hit by something as telegraphed as a clump of magic flying in a straight line. As the attack had failed to put any pressure on them, both my companions soon began unloading on Rynford's magic crystals.</p>
<p>「Stop that!」</p>
<p>Claw, fang, blade and spell assaulted the mineral-like objects and sent them flying all over, and so, despite the fact that they'd been reinforced, they cracked. They’d probably break if hit a few more times.</p>
<p>「Will you stop that already? Shit! I have no choice but to first focus on getting rid of this damn sword!」</p>
<p>Yeah, I figured that’s what he’d end up deciding on, but yeah no. Not happening.</p>
<p>『Burst Flame!』</p>
<p>I purposefully backed off a bit before casting a fire spell a few times. The spell was actually quite weak, but, it would light the target’s surroundings on fire and keep the flames lit for ten odd seconds.</p>
<p>『Burst Flame!』</p>
<p>『Burst Flame!』</p>
<p>Burst Flame was the perfect skill for this situation. It was weak, but I could pretty much spam it to force him to keep his barrier up. Better yet was the fact that the flames obscured his vision and prevented him from tracking me down. As a result, he pretty much ended up being stuck randomly misfiring his attacks.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>「Haaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Growl growl!」</p>
<p>The crystals were ultimately unable to endure Fran and Urushi's endless assault, and hence, one soon crumbled.</p>
<p>Oh sweet! The whole evil atmosphere has cleared up quite a bit! Looks like the crystals were what'd been causing it in the first place.</p>
<p>「How… dare you!」</p>
<p>「Hehe. Victory.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Rynford seemed to understand that one of the crystals had been destroyed despite not having any vision of it, for he let loose a hate filled groan. I couldn't help but want to smirk as I realized that our strategy had been extraordinarily effective.</p>
<p>「The path will close if she destroys another crystal… It looks like I have no choice, but to… 」</p>
<p>The old man suddenly turned off his barrier so he could better protect the crystals. His strategy was reasonable given Burst Flame’s relatively low power, but still, it was risky. It was a move that he wouldn't have been able to choose had he not resolved himself for death.</p>
<p>Rynford dashed towards Fran, his body cloaked in a layer of flame.</p>
<p>「Damned girllll!!!!」</p>
<p>However, I’d long predicted that this would happen. I knew he was eventually going to switch to suicide bomb mode, and so, I’d already plotted my next move in advance.</p>
<p>『Take this!』</p>
<p>I repeated the action I’d taken at the battle’s start, and teleported above him before releasing a bunch of telekinetic energy.</p>
<p>「Ggagargghghajh!」</p>
<p>Blood splurted from Rynford’s mouth as he let loose a pained scream. I had landed a direct hit, and my blade had pierced right through his torso.</p>
<p>The man had been split in two by the attack’s force. The angle from which I hit him had made it so that the upper portion of his body almost kind of looked like the busts you’d find at art exhibitions.</p>
<p>I had applied a bunch of telekinetic force in order to hit the breaks the moment after I collided with Rynford, and so, I had luckily managed to avoid giving the floor anything more than just the slightest nick.</p>
<p>Technically, I had caused a bit of damage earlier as well. I tried to stop Burst Explosion’s flames from spreading, but, I had ultimately ended up leaving the floor a bit scorched. Just a bit though! The Gods won’t mind. I mean, I’m working against the Evil God’s followers here, so they shouldn’t, right? Right…?</p>
<p>I gave the sculptures in my vicinity a bit of a fearful glance, but it didn’t look like they’d reacted in any which way. I guess that made sense. They hadn’t even done anything to Rynford after all, and normally, you’d expect his actions would incur all sorts divine wrath and punishment, so I’m sure I’m still safe.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I’m really sorry. Seriously, I swear I am.</p>
<p>「You sons of bitches! You’re not getting away with this!」</p>
<p>Rynford began screaming curses as I took my sweet time apologizing to the Gods above. Wait, the hell? How’s he not dead? The old man should’ve long been turned into a corpse, but it looked like he was still just full of energy.</p>
<p>「I swear I’m going to fucking break that sword, put it on an altar and sacrifice it to the Evil God himself!」</p>
<p>We immediately tried to finish Rynford off, but he’d already deployed his defensive barrier, so our attacks were unable to reach him. Moreover, he’d even began to regenerate. It looked like he truly had long become something inhuman.</p>
<p>「Zerrosreed! Get the hell over here, right this instant! Summon Clan!」</p>
<p>Rynford had realized that he was at a disadvantage, and thus, he opted to summon one of his subordinates. I’d planned to focus fire said summon the moment it arrived, but was denied the option altogether. The sneaky old bastard had managed to cast the spell within his barrier's confines.</p>
<p>And of all people, he had to have summoned Zerrosreed. We’d yet to meet the guy, but I knew for fact that he would be our toughest opponent yet. He, as a human, had been powerful enough to considered as strong as a B ranked adventurer.</p>
<p>But now, he’d likely transformed into an Evil Human and become even more powerful. It’d probably be best for us to retreat. We couldn’t match something on that level by ourselves.</p>
<p>Or so I thought…</p>
<p>「W-What!? It didn’t work? Summon Clan: Zerrosreed!」</p>
<p>Huh, interesting…? The spell had managed to generate a magic circle, but once again, summoned… absolutely fucking nothing.</p>
<p>「What the hell do you mean, he refused!? C-Could he have betrayed me!?」</p>
<p>Apparently, the old man and his companions had had some sort of falling out.</p>
<p>『Well, I guess this our chance to finish him off.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Will defeat here and now.」</p>
<p>「Growl!」</p>
					
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>128. Rynford: Evil God's Incarnate</b></p>
<p>Rynford reacted to Zerrosreed’s betrayl with a hateful shout, which, in turn provided me yet another chance to assault him with a telekinetic cata-port. [1]</p>
<p>A loud grinding noise filled the temple as I smashed into Rynford’s automatic barrier. That, however, was still just the onset.</p>
<p><span id="more-527"></span></p>
<p>「Burst Flame.」</p>
<p>『Burst Flame!』</p>
<p>「Arooooo!!」</p>
<p>I’d said it all haughty-like, but to be completely honest, my actions hadn’t really changed much at all. I was still draining his mana and keeping him from moving by spamming a bunch of weak skills at him. His barrier would probably end up dissipating if he ran out of magical energy , so I figured it was probably the right thing to do.</p>
<p>「Nraaaghh! Not this shit again!」</p>
<p>Rynford was looking pretty desperate, so we might actually be able to finish him off if we kept this up a bit longer.</p>
<p>「Damn it! The Path has yet to fully open… but it simply cannot be helped. Oh great God of Evil, grant me your power!」</p>
<p>Orrrrr not. Well, I figured he wasn’t about to just sit there till he died.</p>
<p>The old man started to chant, his face still twisted in rage. All the evil energy within the temple gathered around his frame.</p>
<p>The fuck? It almost looked like the temple was giving Rynford its power. Was it because of those crystals he had…?</p>
<p>Shit. Crisis Detection had kicked itself into full throttle. It was reacting just as much as it had been back when we ran into the Midgard Wyrm.</p>
<p>『Fran! Urushi! Get out of there!』</p>
<p>I teleported Fran and I out immediately after confirming that Urushi had dove into the shadows. Our escape was accompanied by the sound of a large explosion. Dust and stone erupted from the temple as it collapsed.</p>
<p>「Gugaaaaaaaa!!」</p>
<p>A roar echoed throughout the night, and with it came a wave of evil-aligned magical energy.</p>
<p>Holy crap he’s huge!</p>
<p>A muscly, black skinned giant, a fifteen meter tall Evil Human-like thing rose from within the temple’s rubble.</p>
<p>At first, I’d thought that it was something Rynford had summoned, but I was wrong.</p>
<p>「Get back here! You’re not escaping me, little girl!」</p>
<p>His shout contained such force that it almost seemed to make the air tremble.</p>
<p>The giant that stood before us was none other than Rynford himself, as evidenced by his mutated but still recognizable face.</p>

<p>Holy shit. He was even more powerful than the demon we’d fought back in the day. His threat level was somewhere between an A and a B, and he even possessed skills the likes of which we’d never heard of before. Engaging him without first finding ourselves some backup was pretty much equivalent to committing suicide.</p>
<p>『Okay, we need to get out of here.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>I started chanting as Fran and Urushi kicked themselves into top gear.</p>
<p>『Short Jump!』</p>
<p>The spell activated after we’d travelled about fifty meters worth of distance. It looked like Fran and I were going to be able to get away if we kept this up. Urushi had the ability to dive into the shadows and whatnot, so he’d be fine too.</p>
<p>That, however, was when things stopped going well.</p>
<p>『Gah!』</p>
<p>「Ow!」</p>
<p>「Whimper!」</p>
<p>Fran and I ended up colliding with what appeared to be some sort of thin wall. The same thing had happened to Urushi as well despite the fact that he was he was still hidden within the shadows.</p>
<p>「You shall not escape the Evil God’s Cage, one of the new abilities with which I was blessed!」</p>
<p>Shit, so that’s what that new skill did!? Looking around made me realize that the cage we were trapped in had was one that extended about fifty meters in every direction with Rynford at its centre.</p>
<p>『Inferno Burst!』</p>
<p>「Fire Javelin!」</p>
<p>I switched from spamming spells to using my Telekinetic Catapult against the barrier’s outer walls.</p>
<p>『Shit! That didn’t work either!?』</p>
<p>The cage, however, remained in tact. In fact, my durability had ended up going down instead. His defensive wall was even stronger than it’d been before.</p>
<p>『Dimension Jump!』</p>
<p>The next spell I tried was one that would let us teleport about a hundred meters. It was kind of finicky, but still better than Short Jump in either case.</p>
<p>Fuck, it’s not working!? Does the barrier have some sort of anti-teleportation property!?</p>
<p>「Evil Flare.」</p>
<p>If I were human, the sudden influx of evil oriented magic energy would likely have caused every single one of my body’s hairs to stand on end. I felt a sense of crisis, a taste a fear. As a result, I ended up firing off the spell I’d been chanting.</p>
<p>『Short Jump!』</p>
<p>A fireball passed right through our previous location before exploding into flames. It was so powerful that it ended up hitting us despite the fact that we were a whole thirty meters away from its point of impact. Luckily, I managed to set up a magical barrier and prevent most of the damage. We would’ve been in a pretty bad spot if we ended up taking a direct hit from it.</p>
<p>「Not a bad dodge, but not good enough! Evil Barrage!」[2]</p>
<p>『What the!?』</p>
<p>「You think you can dodge this?」</p>
<p>Fifty volleyball sized lumps of evil energy materialized around him and started flying at us. Each moved differently; some flew in a straight line, others moved in a more circular arc. The different in movement patterns, combined with the fact that each projectile moved at its own speed, made the attack ridiculously difficult to avoid.</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>『Fire Shield!』</p>
<p>「Haaahh!」</p>
<p>『Wind Wall』</p>
<p>We defended ourselves against the spell by dodging, striking down the projectiles, blocking, and using defensive spells.</p>
<p>Luckily, the individual projectiles were rather weak, they didn’t do that much damage. The problem lay in the fact that getting hit even a single time would lead us to flinch and thereby get hit by the rest.</p>
<p>Shit, what now? Let’s see… we were going to have to somehow escape his barrier, which either meant we would either have to slip or break right through it.</p>
<p>Slipping through it seemed difficult as it stopped both space/time and darkness magic. Do I use up the rest of my points on space/time magic then? Ehh… nah, that seemed like a bad idea if anything. There was no guarantee that pointing stuff would allow us to pass through the barrier.</p>
<p>What if I used my points to get us a bit more brute force? I could probably shove a few into flame magic. Actually, I could probably change up my approach and go with something like purification magic instead. That’d probably be more effective given that he was classified as something evil. Probably.</p>
<p>Actually, we did have yet another option to fall back on if we wanted to go for pure destructive force.</p>
<p>（Master. Will use Latent Potential Release.）</p>
<p>『Wait, don’t!』</p>
<p>Fran had hit the nail on the head. Latent Potential Release would allow us enough power to not only run away, but probably even kill him given how much stronger it’d made us during that whole Lich thing.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>But I wasn’t going to let her use it, absolutely not.</p>
<p>『I’m going to try a little something first.』</p>
<p>I spent six of my remaining eighteen points and maxed out space/time magic, as I figured it seemed like the best option given the current circumstances.</p>
<p>〈Space/Time Magic has reached its maximum level. As a result, you have now obtained the unique skill, Dimensional Magic. Its level is currently set to 1.〉</p>
<p>With the unique skill came the Chronos Clock, Quick, and Slow spells, but as I couldn’t really use them in the current circumstances. I instead tried to activate one of the new space/time spells we learned.</p>
<p>『Long Jump!』</p>
<p>But not even that would let us escape Rynford. We once again ended up with our faces against his barrier. It seemed that the amount of distance our teleport carried us was completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>The old man’s projectiles quickly caught up to and swarmed us once more.</p>
<p>（Should use Latent Potential Release）</p>
<p>『Let me do it then.』</p>
<p>（No. Me.）</p>
<p>『Don’t. That skill’s side effects are ridiculous. You might even end up dead.』</p>
<p>（Still want to）</p>
<p>『Listen to me Fran! No means no!』</p>
<p>（Mrmmph.）</p>
<p>Our exchange was immediately followed by the situation spiraling out of control.</p>
<p>「Guhh!」</p>
<p>『Fran!』</p>
<p>We weren’t able to avoid all the incoming projectiles; one hit Fran head on. Said projectile was immediately followed by many of its kind, and Fran was subject to bombardment. Shit! We lost too much focus!</p>
<p>I immediately teleported us a short distance away and set up a magical barrier.</p>
<p>We managed to escape the attacks and reduce the amount of damage we took, but Rynford didn’t let up. He immediately followed his attack with another.</p>
<p>「Evil Flare!」</p>
<p>「Uaaahhh!」</p>
<p>The old man had managed to catch onto the fact that it was very difficult for us to use short jump several times in a row, so he’d intentionally forced us to use it while also engulfing our destination in scorching hot flames. Both Fran and I immediately deployed our magical barriers at full power in response.</p>
<p>「Kuuaaaahhh!」</p>
<p>『Fuuckk!!』</p>
<p>Our full powered, double barrier was unable to hold against his attack, and so, we were blown about twenty meters away.</p>
<p>「Finally managed you catch you. Quite the pesky little fly you were.」</p>
<p>We narrowed managed to escape death, but it wasn’t too far off. I’d been pretty roughed up, but Fran was looking even worse. She was barely conscious, and her left arm had been burnt black as coal.</p>
<p>『Fran!』</p>
<p>「Ugh…….」</p>
<p>It looked like his next attack would end up finishing us off.</p>
<p>『Fuck off! I’m not letting you harm another hair on Fran’s head!』</p>
<p>I fiddled around with my status as I healed her up.</p>
<p>〈Chant Shortening has reached its maximum level. As a result, you have now obtained the unique skill, Chant Nullification.〉</p>
<p>Chant Nullification: This skill eliminates the need to chant magical invocations. Spells can now be cast simply through the recitation of their names, but at a greater mana cost.</p>
<p>Sweet! I’d been planning to buy time by continuously chanting short jump and teleporting around, so having this skill really helped. It gave us the ability to teleport nonstop as opposed to having to risk damage every time. I was a bit concerned about its increased mana cost, but this wasn’t the time to be brooding over something like that, so whatever! Let’s just do this shit!</p>
<p>『Short Jump!』</p>
<p>『Short Jump!』</p>
<p>『Short Jumppp!!!』</p>
<p>I teleported all over the place in order to avoid Rynford’s attacks and keep Fran safe.</p>
<p>「Argghhh!! I had suspected that you had that skill, but why is it that you can use such a difficult spell so many times in succession!? Just die already! Damn it! Die!」</p>
<p>Instantly casting the spell made it cost about twice as much mana, but that was honestly perfectly fine. It allowed us to spam it and escape Rynford’s assault, which in turn caused him get frustrated. Hell yeah! Keep getting mad! Start messing yourself up by getting tilted!</p>
<p>I started looking for a way out of this situation as I teleported all over the place. If I couldn’t find one, I’d probably end up having to use Latent Potential Release.</p>
<p>「Master…?」</p>
<p>『Let’s see if we can try to find some sort of weak point or something.』 [2]</p>
<p>We continued to dodge and dodge and dodge in order to escape his attacks, but we weren’t able to inflict on him any sort of serious injury. His regenerative abilities outdid everything Fran and Urushi could output.</p>
<p>I tried catapulting myself at him a few times too, but even that failed. It didn’t even actually inflict any major on him. In fact, using the telekinetic catapult ended up giving him an opportunity to counter attack us.</p>
<p>I made sure I at least appeared calm so Fran wouldn’t end up panicking, but honestly, I’d begun feeling a bit frustrated and impatient. We were exhausting ourselves, my mana was starting to run low. I was on the verge of just saying fuck it and using Latent Potential Release.</p>
<p>But then it happened.</p>
<p>The Evil God’s Cage vanished as a high pitched, clear, bell-like sound rang through our surroundings.</p>
<p>「W-What!?」</p>
<p>We had no idea what happened, but it seemed like it was something outside Rynford’s expectations.</p>
<p>I immediately cast all my other thoughts aside and took advantage of the opportunity presented.</p>
<p>『Urushi, Fran, we’re getting the hell out of here, right now!』</p>
<p>「Bark!」</p>
<p>『Dimension Jump!』</p>
<p>I hid us behind a building immediately after teleporting about a hundred meters away.</p>
<p>『You alright?』</p>
<p>「Nn… Somehow.」</p>
<p>『Whew. Good.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「You okay too, Urushi?」</p>
<p>「Ruff.」</p>
<p>I didn’t really know how or why, but we had managed to escape. Whew!</p>
<p>「Nugrahhhhhhhhhh!!!」</p>
<p>The next thing that happened left us in a state of shock. Rynford had let loose a pained scream. Not a howl, or battle cry, but a scream.</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>We hurriedly turned around and beheld the sight before us.</p>
<p>『Holy shit!』</p>
<p>「Lots of swords.」</p>
<p>The evil being’s body had been filled with blades.</p>
<p>A large, snake-like thing had wrapped itself around him and restrained all his movements. Around him stood a small group of individuals.</p>
<p>One crushed Rynford’s right leg with his bare fists. Another had impaled his left with a large, knight-like spear. Some dashed along the ground as others flew through the air. But despite their differences, they were all working together towards a single goal: Rynford’s defeat.</p>
<p>「All really strong.」</p>
<p>『Y-Yeah, they are. Who the hell are they anyways?』<br>

		<p><b>129. Side: Combatants</b></p>
<p><i>Side: Forrund<br>
</i><br>
People first started turning into monstrosities about an hour ago.</p>
<p>I already defeated approximately thirty of them, but their end was nowhere in sight. Many continued to run rampant, and we had no guarantee that people would stop turning into them. Resolving the situation required getting rid of its cause.</p>
<p><span id="more-542"></span></p>
<p>I headed in the direction from which I sensed the most evil energy as I continued to eliminate any monstrosities I came across.</p>
<p>「T-Thank you very much!」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>「U-Uhm…」</p>
<p>「…No prob.」</p>
<p>I gestured at the man thanking me that there was no need for any expression of gratitude, and that he should instead focus his energies on making his escape as the area was still unsafe. But for some odd reason, he ended up apologizing to me with a pale, panicked expression before scrambling away.</p>
<p>I didn’t understand what had happened. I was planning on offering him an escort in order to ensure his safety, so why did he run away…?</p>
<p>「Haaaahh…….」</p>
<p>I sighed.</p>
<p>I never understood why, but things had always been like this. I made sure to stay quiet and expressionless, but everyone would always say that I seemed to give off an air of intimidation. I’d never thought so myself, but apparently that’s just how they saw me. It’s gotten so bad that I’d actually started getting used to scaring everyone I met.</p>
<p>I wasn’t really good at talking to people, so I tried going for gestures instead, but people were still scared me anyways. I was completely at a loss. I didn’t understand how I was supposed to act.</p>
<p>「Can’t be helped. I’ll just keep looking for monstrosities instead.」</p>
<p>I jumped atop the tallest building, some sort of four story business, and surveyed my surroundings.</p>
<p>The change in height granted me a much clearer view of the city.</p>
<p>「Hmm…」</p>
<p>None of the monstrosities had bothered using the night as cover. They didn’t conceal their evil energies or intentions, so I was able to find one almost immediately. It was attacking a group of livestock as opposed to a human, and it was only about three hundred meters away. There was far too little distance between us for me to even consider the possibility of missing, so I decided to deal with it from where I stood.</p>
<p>「Pierce.」</p>
<p>A single magic sword materialized itself in the air, abided by my will, and flew towards its target. The blade carried with it more speed than an arrow and more power than a spear. It pierced the monstrosity with ease, destroying it in a single blow. As it had fulfilled its duty, the blade no longer needed to remain, and so, it dissipated, it returned itself to the void from which it came.</p>
<p>The skill I used was my extra skill, Sword God’s Blessing. Its ability allowed me to create copies of any magic swords I’ve ever touched. The only restriction the skill had was that it possessed a sort of threshold. It was unable to imitate any blade whose abilities that exceeded said threshold. For example, I had once tried imitating Ignis, the Godblade, but my reconstruction of it was to no avail.</p>
<p>At first, the Sword God’s Blessing had only allowed me to create swords. However, honing my skills for years on end eventually allowed me to develop the ability to control them as well. Training with the skill had decreased the amount of time and mana it took me to construct each blade. At present, I had the ability to birth and fire a hundred swords at once.</p>
<p>「…Target sighted.」</p>
<p>I managed to catch sight of another monstrosity. This time around, however, it was attacking a human, so I decided to descend and deal with the issue in person.</p>
<p>Questions flooded my mind as I moved my body towards its destination. I couldn’t help but wonder how this event had come to be. It was far too obscure to be considered something caused by nature, as the monstrosities themselves gave off a sense of evil. They reminded me of one of the high ranking Evil Beings I’d defeated in the past.</p>
<p>The incidents cause simply had to be an unnatural factor. My guesses were that it was either the result of a plot or the loss of control over a sort of forbidden magic item. In either case, I would have to seek out and deal with the problem’s source.</p>
<p>I no longer had a hometown, but Barbra may as well have been my second. I refused to let it fall, I would protect it without fail.</p>
<p>「Forrrund Annonnkul, taking off!」[1]</p>
<p><i>Side: Phillip </i></p>
<p>「Steel your nerves, men! Show the world why Barbra’s knights as known as the elite!」</p>
<p>「Sir! Yes sir!」</p>
<p>「By your command!」</p>
<p>「For honour!」</p>
<p>My subordinates roared in response to my provocation. They looked to be in good form.</p>
<p>「Move out!」</p>
<p>Naturally, I, as the commander, was obligated to put on a display in which my men would find no shame. I raised my spear and charged straight into the horde of monsters before me.</p>
<p>My father had informed me that this incident was one perpetrated by none other than my very own younger brothers. I, as their flesh and blood, had no choice but to make amends for their mistakes.</p>
<p>I first learned of this information just before the clock struck midnight. My father had paid me a visit in order to inform me of Bluke’s plan. I was shocked by its contents, and dreaded the fate he had faced.</p>
<p>「Father, that simply cannot be. Are you sure that you speak the truth!?」</p>
<p>「I am… It is undoubtedly true… The city has already begun descending into a state of madness…」</p>
<p>The words that came out of my father’s mouth had almost seemed like a mere delusion given his haggard state. However, even the most meagre glance at Bluke’s form resulted in my realisation that my father was as correct as could be.</p>
<p>It was none other than my duty as a sibling to right my younger brothers’ wrongs and clear the Krysten family’s name of its sins. Regrettably, I must concede that our clan has betrayed the citizen’s trust, thus, it was necessary for me to risk my life in combat in order to regain it.</p>
<p>Many of the monstrosities bore faces recognizable as those belonging to the city’s nobles, likely a result of my youngest brother, Waint, marketing his goods towards an aristocratic audience. It was a nobles duty to protect the country’s people, yet, the monstrosities had fallen to the point where they instead attacked them. I felt but pity for their souls. I steeled my resolve and decided that I would strike them down before they stained their hands with the people’s blood.</p>
<p>I knew not whether they rejoiced upon being felled by the blade of my spear. However, I felt it a necessary purge, for I bore no remorse in slaying a noble capable of casting the citizens’ lives away for the sake of preserving their own hide.</p>
<p>「Buaaaahhhhhhh!」</p>
<p>「Screeeeech!」</p>
<p>But even then, I sympathized with the fates that had befallen them.</p>
<p>「Oh Magical Lance, Granbolt, demonstrate your abilities! Fell all foes of mine!」</p>
<p>My beloved spear gave off a brilliant shine as it consumed my mana to viel itself in a coat of lightning.</p>
<p>「Penetrating Charge!」</p>
<p>The technique pierced through the throats of two different monstrosities as Granbolt electrocuted and paralyzed my foes.</p>
<p>「By my order, waste not this opportunity! Slay our enemies!」</p>
<p>My men made use of the opportunity I had created for them. They charged straight towards the monstrosities and sent them to their graves. Our coordination had allowed us to clear an entire area of them in but a single swoop.</p>
<p>「The coast is clear, we shall move onto the citizen’s residential district. If you bear any wounds or complaints, raise your voices now or risk losing the opportunity.」</p>
<p>「Sir! We’re ready to march!」</p>
<p>My subordinates responded with shouts full of vigour.</p>
<p>「Very well, we shall split into two squadrons. Divide yourselves into five man units. Scatter throughout the district and eliminate any monstrosities you cross. I shall work alone. Many a task requires my attention.」</p>
<p>「Sir! Yes sir! Orders acknowledged sir!」</p>
<p>「Forget not that not all our foes will immediately fall before us. Many powerful beings lie within their ranks.」</p>
<p>「We will sir. You take care of yourself too.」</p>
<p>It has come time for me to locate the incident’s mastermind.</p>
<p>Ten minutes passed as I scoured the city for villains. It was then that I witnessed it. A manor in close proximity to my own had bursted into flame.</p>
<p>Side: Zerrosreed</p>
<p>『What is the meaning of this!? Have you betrayed me, Zerrosreed!?』</p>
<p>Shut the fuck up! I’m having fun here you old shit!</p>
<p>「Dorahhhhh!!!」</p>
<p>「Gugyaagaaaa!」</p>
<p>「Hahahahahahahaha! That's what I'm talking about! And he was just a D ranker before transforming too!」</p>
<p>「Gyooohh!」</p>
<p>I was fighting one of the guys Rynford turned into an Evil Being just cause he happened to catch my eye.</p>
<p>Guy was an experienced D ranked adventurer, and a strong one at that. Hahahaha! Just crossing swords with him has got my blood boiling. Going along with that stupidly long plan the old shit had turned out to be worth it. Even managed to get myself some of the Evil God’s power.</p>
<p>Trying to kill the guy was fun, but he couldn’t really hold much longer. Was fine though, fun was to be found wherever I looked!</p>
<p>「Chestooooo!!!」[2]</p>
<p>「Gaahhh…..」</p>
<p>I used the power I gained from Zerais’ human experiments and absorbed the evil energy that that came off the dude’s corpse.</p>
<p>Skill was called cannibalism. Let me absorb power from anything that was “the same as me.” Think he said that meant both Evil Beings and Evil Beasts.</p>
<p>Rynford’s gotten me a tonne of prey. This rate, I could just go around hunting down evil beings to make myself stronger. And you know what? I might as well eat that old ass mother fucker while I’m at it too and make myself even more powerful!</p>
<p><i>Side: Colbert</i></p>
<p>「Urraaaaghhhh! Dimitris Style Martial Art: Impact Wave!」</p>
<p>My fist drove itself into the muscular daruma’s face. It was strong, but failed to match me given that I had removed my restraints. [3]</p>
<p>「Colbert’s already defeated another one!」</p>
<p>「He sure is strong.」</p>
<p>「It looks like strong people end up turning into strong monsters.」</p>
<p>Lydia seemed to have hit nail on the head. The woman I had just defeated was a former E ranked adventurer. The transformation rendered her too difficult a foe for The Scarlet Maidens to safely combat.</p>
<p>One of the inn’s employees had also undergone the same sort of transformation, however, the had ended up much weaker. Even they had been able to dispose of him without too much trouble.</p>
<p>If Lydia's conjecture was to truly be the case, then the area in which we were currently located could be considered relatively safe. The most dangerous areas likely lay near the Adventurer’s Guild and Knight’s Headquarters. Another cause for concern was the noble's district, seeing as how a part of it had already erupted into a pillar of flame. That, of course, was not the end of my concerns. My final worry lay with Miss Fran, as I was almost convinced that she knew the incident’s cause.</p>
<p>I do hope she manages to make back safely.</p>
<p>「Oh yeah, I’ve been meaning to ask, have you like powered up or something, Colbert?」</p>
<p>「You can tell?」</p>
<p>「I can.」</p>
<p>「You’re clearly moving faster than you were before.」</p>
<p>「I guess I don’t really mind letting you know. I’m currently studying the Dimitris school of martial arts. Specifically, I’m undergoing a trial in order obtain the school's recognition.」</p>
<p>「Ohhh, I see.」</p>
<p>「Makes sense.」</p>
<p>The girls were able to understand exactly what I meant despite my lack of a detailed explanation. I did understand why that was though. The Dimitris school’s trial was rather famous.</p>
<p>「Huh? What’s that supposed to mean?」</p>
<p>Apparently Judith was unaware of the trials and their details, so I decided to offer her a short explanation.</p>
<p>I was sure she knew of Dimitris and his exploits, but I explained his profile to her regardless. I told her that he was an S ranked adventurer known as the world’s strongest Fighter. I described his feats, and made mention of how he defeated a dragon with his bare hands, and even managed to pummel a demon to death unarmed. After solidifying his style, he eventually created a school in order to pass it on and allow it to be learned by future generations.</p>
<p>His school of combat was so mighty that not even the Gods could overlook it. His techniques were obtained official recognition as a skill, a feat that had only ever occured twenty times in the past.</p>
<p>The martial arts had long been recognized by the Gods as the most efficient mode of combat, a consensus reached upon the witness of a match between the God of Battle and the God of War. Martial arts came to be known was known for their flexibility, their capacity to allow their users to react to and deal with almost any given situation. Each martial artist had their own techniques, their own special attacks and feints, but their techniques all fell under the umbrella known as martial arts regardless.</p>
<p>The same applied to all forms of combat. That is, if I were a swordsman, my sword related skills would continue to be known as Sword Arts and Sword Techniques regardless of any methodologies and thought paradigms I had established. Under normal circumstances, I would never be able to obtain the “Colbert Style Swordplay” skill regardless of how hard I trained. That much was common sense.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>However, common sense was a factor that failed to extend into the realm of the ingenious. The gifted sometimes refined themselves to the point where not even the Gods dared deny their abilities, and thus, they were granted skills in their name. The techniques they created were engraved into the very world itself.</p>
<p>And that was precisely what had happened to Demitris. His style was ultimately classified as a derivative of the martial arts series of skills.</p>
<p>I enrolled myself in his school and trained in the Demitris ways until my Demitris Style skill had ascended to its eighth level. Only then did I finally managed to meet the school’s minimum requirements for formal apprenticeship.</p>
<p>Rather, I had managed to qualify myself for the trial that would lead to my admission to formal apprenticeship, the world renown Demitris school’s trial.</p>
<p>The trial’s contents required the examinee to become an A ranked adventurer whilst suppressing their strength with one of Demitris’ carefully crafted sealing stones.</p>
<p>The sealing stones possessed the ability to disguise one’s stats. It would hide the Demitris Style Martial Arts skill and the sealed state from any would be appraisers. The reason for this was that clients may otherwise make claims against the examinee. It was possible for them to state that the examinee caused them losses as a result of them failing to give their full, unsealed effort.</p>
<p>Of course, it was possible to undo the seal if desired, as evidenced by my actions.</p>
<p>「I see, that explains that.」</p>
<p>「I plan to seal my abilities away once after we put this incident is behind us, so please refrain from spreading the word if possible.」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry, we will.」</p>
<p>「So what now, Colbert?」</p>
<p>「I do think we’ve managed to avert any crisis, but I’d like you three to remain here at the inn and protect it just in case.」</p>
<p>「What’ll you do?」</p>
<p>「I will be heading over to the Adventu—」</p>
<p>A loud smashing sound cut me off before I managed to convey my intentions.</p>
<p>「W-What was that?」</p>
<p>「I-I think that’s where the temple is.」</p>
<p>「That thing’s enormous!」</p>
<p>「That… looks like it’s bad news. My Crisis Detection skill has activated despite how far away we are from it.」</p>
<p>I can’t say for sure whether or not the monster standing near the temple’s ruins was the cause of this whole incident, but I knew that I simply could not leave it be.</p>
<p>「It may even end up destroying Barbra in its entirety if worse comes to worst.」</p>
<p>「Is it really that strong?」</p>
<p>「To be frank, I doubt I’ll be able to defeat it.」</p>
<p>「Even with your seal undone!?」</p>
<p>「So it’s too strong? Even for True Colbert?」</p>
<p>I would very much appreciate if she would stop calling me that.</p>
<p>「At most, I would be able to buy the city some time assuming I was by myself.」</p>
<p>「What if w-」</p>
<p>「Don’t.」</p>
<p>「Why not?」</p>
<p>「I’d prefer not to send you to your deaths in vain.」</p>
<p>My reply caused all three girls to lower their gazes. I was sure that they understood that they would encounter instant deaths should they follow me, and that I would likely meet the same fate in an effort to protect them.</p>
<p>「I’ll be off. I leave the inn’s protection to you.」</p>
<p>「Alright…」</p>
<p>「I’ll… We’ll do everything we can!」</p>
<p>「Let’s go help the knights get everyone evacuated!」</p>
<p>「Great idea, but don’t be pushing yourselves too hard.」</p>
<p>「Same goes to you, Colbert!」</p>
<p><i>Side: Amanda<br>
</i><br>
I arrived in Barbra two days after receiving Fran’s letter. I had done everything in my power in order to arrive as quickly as possible. In fact, I’d travelled in a straight line, I passed through mountains and forests without so much as changing directions. Naturally, I had been using magic to make this possible. My excessive consumption of mana potions had led my stomach to swell uncomfortably.</p>
<p>There was no way for me to leave Alessa under normal circumstances, as at least one A ranked adventurer was required to stay within the town's premises at all times in order to deter the Kingdom of Reidos from attacking.</p>
<p>I was quite lucky in the sense that I just so happened to have a scapegoat on hand. I owed Jean my thanks. He was a B ranker, but treated like an A ranker when it came to any sort of situation related to war. In fact, I’d say that the Reidosians feared him much more than they did me.</p>
<p>Jean’s nickname, “The Annihilator” was one that stemmed from a Reidosian conflict. His abilities would really shine whenever he was put up against any sort of army. His forces would absorb the enemies and grow seemingly infinitely as the battle progressed. On one occasion, his undead corps had in fact managed to completely obliterate a Reidosian unit 5000 strong. Their army feared him, and for good reason at that.</p>
<p>His presence and accomplishments were why I was able to safely push, er, leave the city in his hands and head off in Barbra’s direction.</p>
<p>Fran had said that she thought the orphanage to be in a terrible state, and frankly, I was inclined to agree. I had nothing but respect for Io, who, in spite of her situation, was able to continue feeding the children delicious meals.</p>
<p>It was fine though. I immediately bought the orphanage the moment I arrived and provided it with all sorts of funds and support. Seeing the children thank me made the whole trip well worth it. Their smiles gave me enough fuel to fight another ten years worth of battles.</p>
<p>The next task on my list was to pay Fran a visit. She was running a stall, so I decided to drop by under the guise of a customer as a bit of an added surprise. I was really looking forward to seeing a surprised look on her face. Keyword: was.</p>
<p>「Haaaaaahh!」</p>
<p>My whip easily cleaved a monstrosity in two. It seemed rather weak. It had been an adventurer prior to its transformation, but the resulting monster didn’t seem like anything a D ranker couldn’t handle.</p>
<p>「Right, I should hurry over to that giant.」</p>
<p>A roar echoed through the night right as I finished exterminating all the monstrosities in the orphanage’s immediate vicinity. The battlecry was followed by an immense wave of evil energy, the likes of which I’d never felt before.</p>
<p>Glancing at the monstrosity, even from a distance, told me that it was a dangerous foe to face. It would likely destroy the entire city if I let it be, and that, of course, would mean that the orphanage would be reduced to wreckage and rubble.</p>
<p>I felt pretty confident in leaving the orphanage in the knights’ and adventurers’ hands, but I still wanted to return as soon as I could.</p>
<p>I was worried about Fran too.</p>
<p>My next course of action would of course be to take down the giant foe and search its surroundings for clues. There was some doubt as to whether or not I would be able to defeat it unassisted, but I simply had no choice. Thus was the duty of the A ranked adventurer.</p>
<p>Besides…</p>
<p>「That thing’ll end up hurting a lot of children if I leave it to its devices!」</p>
<p>I sensed several other individuals carry out actions identical to my own. It appeared to me that they were the city’s higher ranking adventurers.</p>
<p>「There’s one.」</p>
<p>I approached the closest individual.</p>
<p>「Good evening.」</p>
<p>「Woah! H-Huh? G-Good evening.」</p>
<p>The person I met with was an adorable young lady with silver hair. She was carrying her body rather effectively, but I could still see quite some room for improvement. She didn’t seem strong enough to be handling a task like challenging the giant, and so, I decided to advise her to stop.</p>
<p>「Are you heading to that giant thing over there?」</p>
<p>「I-I am. Are you?」</p>
<p>「Yes, I am. The name’s Amanda. What’s yours?」</p>
<p>「Charlotte. I’m not very strong, but I’m sure that there’s something for me to do regardless.」</p>
<p>She seemed quite motivated. I wasn’t able to immediately determine how I should be going about changing her mind. The other adventurers joined us before I managed to arrive at a conclusion.</p>
<p>「Hey there. Are you planning to help give that thing a good bashing?」</p>
<p>「It is for that precise reason that I have arrived.」</p>
<p>It seemed that all members present had felt it dangerous to challenge the creature alone.</p>
<p>「Hundred Blade Forrund, Amanda of Hairiti, Knight Captain Phillip, and even the guildmaster: Dragonfeller Gamud? Quite the gathering of big shots we have here.」</p>
<p>The man who spoke, Colbert, seemed rather surprised. He stated that the knight captain was said to be at least as strong as a B ranker. I was aware that the guildmaster was a former A ranker himself. Forrund and I were both A rankers as well, meaning we had more than enough capable individuals to take down the gigantic monstrosity.</p>
<p>「And who might you be?」</p>
<p>I turned towards our last supposed companion.</p>
<p>「No one important, don’t be minding me. Just think me a nameless helper or something.」</p>
<p>「If you were to ask me, I’d say you resemble the Berserker.」</p>
<p>「What, you wanna take me in or something? At a time like this? You guys need all the help you can get.」</p>
<p>「I’m aware of that, I’ll be counting on you then.」</p>
<p>His points were valid, so I decided to accept his help, at least for now.</p>
<p>「’Course. I can’t actually beat you guys down yet, not as I am right now anyways. Besides, I’m way more interested in that giant thing over there than you guys in the first place, so we can all spend some time getting along for now, right? And of course, I’m talking to the guy glaring at me from over there too.」</p>
<p>「…I’ll overlook you for now.」</p>
<p>Colbert and the Berserker seemed to have some sort of bad blood with one another. The atmosphere was almost explosive in nature. I suspected that I may have had to discipline them before moving onto eliminating the giant, but fortunately, both men clearly understood that this wasn’t the time for any sort of internal conflict.</p>
<p>Again, we definitely had enough battle power to take our foe down.</p>
<p>However, there was still an issue. The monstrosity had a barrier around it, one that the Hundred Blade claimed to be unable to break. He was known for his brute strength, so I highly doubted that anyone else present would be able to shatter the barrier.</p>
<p>「The barrier seems to both block out magic and ignore the laws of physics. We’re stuck waiting until that thing runs out of mana.」</p>
<p>How troublesome.</p>
<p>The Hundred Blade also informed us that there was someone inside the barrier, and that that someone was currently engaging the monstrosity in combat. We had no choice but to wait until the combatant managed to deplete the monster’s mana pool. The barrier appeared as if it may also end up being temporarily released if the person fighting was to fall, as apparently, it had originally been constructed in order to keep the individual within its confines. Ideally, I would prefer for the latter option not to happen. The person was brave enough to challenge the monstrosity before any other had arrived on scene. It was their actions that allowed us to arrive before the town’s destruction, so I would like for them to live.</p>
<p>Charlotte timidly entered our conversation as we went back and forth on how we should best approach the problem.</p>
<p>The young lady stated that she had a skill that allowed her to purify evil energies. She could potentially eliminate the barrier.</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>「Really. The ritual I would perform would be one that combines both dance and song. I’m not really good at fighting, but I should be able to at least do that much.」</p>
<p>「That’s perfect. Everyone has their specialities, and yours is one that just happens to be exactly what we needed.」</p>
<p>And so, we came up with one some claimed to be a plan. I myself doubted the the claim, as all we decided on was that we would attack the monstrosity the moment Charlotte removed its barrier.</p>
<p>「Here goes…」</p>
<p>Charlotte’s bracelet vibrated and gave off a bell-like noise as she started to dance.</p>
<p>「Let’s get ourselves ready while she finishes up with the ritual.」</p>
<p>I raised my whip and began focusing my magical energies.</p>
<p>The time to fight was upon us.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>[1] Think what people say as their Gundams launch. Unfortunately, I have no idea what they normally use in the English versions of it…</p>
<p>[2] This is something Japanese people sometimes scream when going for the finishing blow. It is meant to convey one's spirit as a fighter. It's sometimes translated as something along the lines of "take this," but that doesn't really work in my opinion. It's literal meaning of "chest" (the target area) fails to capture it as well. I decided to leave it in alongside this note for the time being because I've yet to determine the best possible translation.</p>
<p>[3] I am 99% sure that the author messed up here. Colbert probably doesn't know what a Daruma is because that's a Japanese thing and he is a denizen of the fantasy world the Japanese person was transported to. That said, it is possible for Darumas to exist in this fantasy world because it is created by a Japanese author.</p>

<p>「Pierce, oh blades of mine.」</p>
<p>A hundred or so swords materialized out of nowhere and shot straight towards Rynford’s body. We were watching the battle from pretty close up, so I could actually tell that every single blade was distinct, each possessed its own unique properties and abilities.</p>
<p><span id="more-549"></span></p>
<p>This wasn’t the first time we’d come across the guy who'd launched the attack. I still remembered catching sight of him at the end of our hunting trip.</p>

_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Forrund? Oh yeah, I remember Colbert mentioning him and calling him an A ranked adventurer. I think his nickname was Hundred Blade Forrund or something like that? Either way, he really did seem just as strong as Amanda.</p>
<p>His extra skill was pretty impressive too. Its description said it’d let him duplicate any magic sword he managed to get his hands on, with the exception of anything super high tier. That really got me thinking, would he be able to copy me…? What would happen if he did? I was feeling pretty curious about it, but honestly, I'd prefer not to find out. Neither of the two conclusions were what I would call trouble free, so I’ll have to sure I stay as far away from him as possible.</p>
<p>Colbert looked like he was participating in Rynford’s subjugation as well. He seemed a bit stronger than usual, seemingly because of that Demitris Style skill. I don't remember seeing that last time I appraised him. Had he been keeping it hidden with a piece of equipment or something? If so, then why the sudden change?</p>
<p>Everyone else present was pretty strong too. The Gamud guy really seemed to stand out in particular. His Divine Hammer Arts allowed him to swing his giant warhammer around like it was nothing. His strikes were so powerful that they actually ended up making Rynford stagger despite the difference in the two combatant's sizes. It turned out that he was actually Barbra’s guildmaster, which more than explained his strength.</p>
<p>The knight named Phillip was also doing pretty well. He swung a large knight's spear around with ease despite being covered from head to toe in plate armour. The most interesting part about him was that his last name was Krysten, meaning he was probably Rhodas’ eldest son. Bluke must not have understood the extent of his elder brother’s strength. Any assassins he sent after Phillip would probably have ended up dead.</p>
<p>Zerrosreed was fighting alongside them for some odd reason as well. I guess he probably had his own reasons, seeing as how he betrayed Rynford and all that. He didn’t seem intent on attacking Colbert for the time being either, so I didn’t really think we needed to pay his loyalties all that much mind, at least not for now. I was moreso worried about his current species. He wasn’t just your everyday Evil Being, he’d apparently become a subspecies known as a Demonic Being. That Cannibalism skill pretty bad news. It wasn't the type of skill that either Fran nor I could make much use of, but to him, the city was pretty much like an all you could eat buffet. Wait, did he betray Rynford just so he could consume him? Hmm… I get that he’s technically an ally for now. I don’t plan on attacking him, but it’d probably be pretty bad to just leave him be…</p>
<p>「Fran!」</p>
<p>「Amanda?」</p>
<p>「Are you alright? I hadn’t been expecting you to be the one fighting that gigantic monstrosity!」</p>
<p>「Here, why?」</p>
<p>「I hurried over the moment I got the letter you sent me.」</p>
<p>The weird snake-like thing currently keeping Rynford restrained turned out to be Amanda’s whip. Wait, didn’t we only just send that letter like three days ago? Holy crap she got here fast.</p>
<p>『You sure it’s okay for you not to be in Alessa?』</p>
<p>「Don’t worry about it, I’m having Jean watch over the town in my place.」</p>
<p>『Wait, isn’t Jean just a B ranker though?』</p>
<p>「He is, but he’s treated like he’s an A ranker in times of war.」</p>
<p>Amanda told us a few things about Jean and convinced me that he was well deserving of his nickname. The ability to command an entire army’s wroth of undead? Yup, sounded threatening enough to me.</p>
<p>A young girl ran up to us as Amanda gave Fran a bit of a hand. She seemed terrified of Rynford, and kept glancing in his direction as she approached. In spite of her fears, however, she still managed to reach Fran and offer her a potion.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Um… Are you alright?」</p>
<p>「Seen somewhere before?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, we have. She was one of the Lunar Banquet’s dancers.』</p>
<p>「My name is Charlotte. How are your injuries?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Fine. Just slight exhaustion.」</p>
<p>She was more than just a little bit exhausted, both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>「I want to talk to you a bit more, but first, I’m going to have to go get rid of the monster that hurt you, okay?」</p>
<p>「Make sure you be careful out there!」</p>
<p>Charlotte gave Rynford another quick glance as she spoke.</p>
<p>「Don’t worry about it. I’ll be right back.」</p>
<p>Amanda gave both Fran and Charlotte a light wave before leaping towards the Evil Human. Her kind smile had transformed into a ferocious one, she seemed rather angry at the fact that Rynford had hurt Fran.</p>
<p>She immediately began attacking him with what I assumed was some sort of skill. Her whip grew several times longer and attacked him from every direction at once each time she gave her wrist so much as even the slightest twitch. Every single one of her strikes was as powerful as one of our sword techniques.</p>
<p>The other combatants’ attacks were inflicting quite a bit of harm of damage as well. They were all clearly stronger than us.</p>
<p>Just looking at the scene really made it hit home that Rynford had never actually been invincible or anything like that. So, knowing that, why was it that I never thought of anything but running away? Did we really have no way of fighting him at all?</p>
<p>I understood the answer to both questions. I had been afraid of Rynford, and my fear of him had ended up making me feel as if it was simply impossible for us to defeat him. I ended up doing nothing but thinking about how we could go about running away, even after getting two new unique skills. I mean, the outcome we arrived at wasn’t necessarily a bad one. We managed to avoid the worst case scenario of death, but thinking back on it, we’d been far too cowardly. Why did not try pointing one of my offensive skills instead? We might’ve been able to face him head on if I had.</p>
<p>（Master.）</p>
<p>『What’s up?』</p>
<p>（Frustrating.）</p>
<p>『Yeah… It sure does feel frustrating doesn’t it…?』</p>
<p>Watching Amanda and everyone else present fight filled me with a sense of irritation. I was going to have to fix the fact that I was still weak. I needed to train, and seriously, at that. It was something I needed to start the moment this issue was dealt with and out of the way.</p>
<p>『…No, that’s not right.』</p>
<p>I realized that I was still letting my fears get ahold of me. There was no reason for me to wait until everything was done and over with. The battle had yet to end. We could still join the fray and contribute to Rynford’s defeat.</p>
<p>There was no point to just sitting around and mulling over my sense of frustration. The enemy that’d caused it was right there in front of us. We had no reason to rule out combat as an option as we had before. I understood that I still felt the subconscious urge to run the hell away, but now, we were immediately presented the chance to turn that emotion on its head.</p>
<p>What we needed to do now was not to wait, but to fight.</p>
<p>『Let’s go, Fran.』</p>
<p>（Will pay back for frustration.）</p>
<p>Fran understood my intentions. It seemed I was still no match for her in terms of mental fortitude.</p>
<p>「Are you planning to join the battle?」</p>
<p>Fran was given a worried look as she rose to her feet. I thought for a second that Charlotte had intended to stop us, but, she instead ended up giving us a bit of encouragement alongside a potion.</p>
<p>「Do your best out there.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I can’t fight myself, but I will at least be able to offer you my assistance.」</p>
<p>Charlotte brought her hands together as she spoke. A mysterious light enveloped Fran’s body, accompanied by the chiming of a bell filled our ears.</p>
<p>「I have given you a barrier that exorcises and wards off evil energies. But be careful, it's rather frail.」</p>
<p>「Monster's barrier. Broken by you?」</p>
<p>「Yes, that's correct.」</p>
<p>Wow, seriously? I’m sorry I thought your stats were really low.</p>
<p>（Everyone amazing.）</p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>
<p>Stats were important, but they weren’t all that mattered. The abilities to adapt and draw out one's potential to its fullest were just as important.</p>
<p>Fran went silent for a bit, seemingly lost in thought.</p>
<p>『What’s the matter?』</p>
<p>（Master. I’ll lead.）</p>
<p>『What do you mean?』</p>
<p>（Couldn’t do anything when running from Rynford. Not just this once. Always relied on Master. This time, let me lead.）</p>
<p>『Fran…』</p>
<p>I’d actually been thinking that I was trying too hard to do everything by myself. I didn’t ask Fran for her opinion nearly as often as I should have, but, it looked like all that was about to change.</p>
<p>『Alright, got it. What are you planning though?』</p>
<p>（Want to try something new.）</p>
<p>『Like what?』</p>
<p>（Finishing move like Master’s Overburst. Thought about it for a long time already. Conclusion, attack that uses everything we have at once.）</p>
<p>Her use of the word “we” meant that she wanted me to be doing something as well. More importantly though, it implied that she was confident she’d be able to draw out every last bit of my power. Awesome! As a sword, I couldn’t feel more blessed. I was sure that I would one day grow to rival even the Godblades if I were to remain in Fran’s hands.</p>
<p>（Want specific skills to be set.）</p>
<p>I think this might be the first time Fran’s ever asked me to set any specific skills in combat.</p>
<p>『Alright, take your pick.』</p>
<p>And so, with Fran’s selected skills in tow, we took off and dove straight in Rynford’s direction.</p>
					
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>131 Strength and Technique<br>
</b></p>
<p>「Master. Thing I wanted to try.」</p>
<p>『Lay it on me. I’m ready for whatever, though I’m a bit nervous because we aren’t really going to get to practice it or anything.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Skills. Air Compression, Magic Thread Weaving… 」</p>
<p><span id="more-556"></span></p>
<p>Fran ultimately ended up asking me to set fourteen different skills: Flame Magic, Wind Magic, Atmospheric Circulation Control, Air Compression, Air Jump, Vibration Fang, Anti-Weight, Weight Boost, Elemental Blade, Charge, Parallel Processing, Magic Thread Weaving, Magic Poison Fang, and Coordination.</p>
<p>She got to work the moment I had them set, and raised both arms in front of her with her palms facing forward. She made use of the Atmospheric Circulation Control skill and created herself a pair of cube-shaped blocks of air, each about a meter and a half in diameter. Each was populated by a bunch of thin magic threads.</p>
<p>『Oh, I get it now! Nice thinking!』</p>
<p>The combination allowed her to manipulate the threads in midair and move around in kind of the same manner as Spiderm*n or someone with a Three Dimensional Maneuver Gear.</p>
<p>Fran immediately moved the threads behind her and leaned on them to pull them back. They were elastic, so they quickly sprung back against her and launched her through the air.</p>
<p>At first, I’d thought that her actions resembled those of a pro wrestler, but a bit more observation led me to think of the threads as the spring in a pinball machine.</p>
<p>Fran used Air Compression and covered me in a layer of wind as she leapt into the air and delivered a powerful overhead swing.</p>
<p>「Nn. Works well.」</p>
<p>She nodded with a satisfied look on her face. I didn’t know exactly what she was planning, but it looked like it was going well.</p>
<p>「Time for practical application. Will explain in detail.」</p>
<p>Fran filled me in on her plan. The thing she had in mind was nothing short of interesting, though, under normal circumstances, it would likely be labeled as reckless.</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s do this.』</p>
<p>As per her suggestions, I used Long Jump and teleported us way up into the sky directly atop Rynford’s head.</p>
<p>「Starting now.」</p>
<p>『I’ll support you with everything I got!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran began compressing the air and generating magic threads the moment she teleported. Unlike our little trial run, however, this time, she was going all out and pouring every last bit of magical energy she could muster into her spells. She soon started free falling, but didn’t seem to mind as she calmly placed the thread she constructed above her head.</p>
<p>She then used Air Jump to leap straight up, and did exactly as she had during the little practice session earlier. This time, however, she didn’t fly launch herself horizontally. Instead, she propelled her body straight down.</p>
<p>And that was just the beginning.</p>
<p>Fran used Air Jump and Wind Magic in tandem to create herself a series of vertical footholds, which she ran straight down in order to raise her speed even further. She readied me for action by raising me above her head and used Atmospheric Circulation Control to minimize the amount of wind resistance generated while also using Weight Boost to bolster my weight to a point well over the fifty kilogram mark.</p>
<p>I’d become incredibly heavy for a weapon, but the combination of Fran’s strength stat and the Anti-weight skill allowed her to continue wielding me without any issue.</p>
<p>We rapidly closed in on Rynford, while using the Espionage skill to to remain undetected.</p>
<p>I molded the shape of my body as she got ready to swing. She’d requested me to take on a form with a backwards arching blade. There were a few other instructions as well, and so, in the end, I ultimately ended up as something that closely resembled a katana, a result that left me shocked. I’d never told her about katanas before, the idea she had was one that she’d formed all on her own.</p>
<p>The only worry I had was that our sword skills wouldn’t end up applying to katanas. We did have a few potentially applicable skills, like Single Edged Sword Arts, but their levels were all fairly low. The fact that Single Edged Sword Arts and Double Edged Sword Arts had been differentiated meant that they likely were mutually exclusive, so I made sure to leave two edges and retain a more longswordy shape in general. [1]</p>
<p>「Oh?」</p>
<p>Rynford finally noticed us after we got within the twenty five meter range, which made sense. It was pretty hard to avoid detection without any cover given our proximity to him.</p>
<p>「You were still alive, girl!?」</p>
<p>Rynford stared at her with bloodshot eyes as he let loose a hate filled scream. A rancid, purple miasma accompanied his words and leaked out of his mouth as he shouted. The smoke-like substance was filled with evil energy; everything that touched it, be it skin or armour, would end up melting away as if dipped in acid. The most annoying part about it was that it had an incredibly large area of effect.</p>
<p>So what do? I had no idea how we were supposed to go about avoiding it.</p>
<p>「One trick pony.」</p>
<p>I didn't manage to think up a solution myself, but it was an attack that we’d already seen time and time again. Fran had long predicted it and prepared a countermeasure.</p>
<p>「Burnia」</p>
<p>Burnia, a level two flame spell, allowed its caster to use the power of an explosion in order to provide themselves a burst of speed. It was a bit difficult to use, as the caster would end up getting caught in the explosion radius.</p>
<p>Fran quickly created a barrier of wind that served not one or two, but three functions. It reduced the amount of damage the explosion inflicted upon us, allowed her to increase her velocity even further, and even protected her from the miasma's effects as she charged straight through it.</p>
<p>Rynford’s eyes bulged as he realized that she managed to break through his smokescreen without taking any damage.</p>
<p>「Damn you, you impudent brat!!」</p>
<p>He rapidly raised both arms and guarded his face against the assault he couldn’t help but label as dangerous.</p>
<p>What an idiot.</p>
<p>He’d fallen for our feint. Fran had directed all her bloodlust at him while gazing straight into his eyes, so he’d assumed that we’d been targeting his head.</p>
<p>But that was far from the truth.</p>
<p>「Haaaahhhhh!」</p>
<p>『Haaaahhhhh!』</p>
<p>Fran’s strike was aimed not as his cranium, but at his torso.</p>
<p>The level five Collaboration skill allowed me to understand her intents without the two of us having to perform any sort of actual communication. I casted Elemental Blade to wreath my body in flame, activated Vibration Fang, and triggered Magic Poison Fang right as we got ready to strike.</p>
<p>And of course, I wasn’t the only one to act. Fran had activated the exact skills, but with Magic Poison Fang substituted out for Weight Boost. She seemed to know that my blade wouldn’t hold out for too long, so she made sure that the six skills we casted remained active for only a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>That, however, was more than enough. Fran drew me from the air she had compressed around me like a sheath and concentrated all her energies into a single godspeed slash. [2]</p>
<p>Her attack wasn’t like my Telekinetic Catapult. It wasn’t something as simple or dull as a display of brute force, but rather, a finely crafted technique that embodied the very meaning of the term “ultimate.” [3]</p>

<p>「Nraaaaghhhhhhhhh!!」</p>
<p>The vicious strike left a deep wound that extended all the way from Rynford’s shoulder down to his midsection. I felt my blade sever his very heart in two.</p>
<p>We weren’t able to immediately check out our handywork in detail, as I was forced to teleport Fran away before she crashed into the ground.</p>
<p>「Thanks Master.」</p>
<p>『Whew, barely made it.』</p>
<p>Fran was calm despite the fact that we would’ve ended up face planting into the earth’s surface if I waited even a second longer. Not to brag, but I could tell she really trusted me.</p>
<p>We turned back towards Rynford shortly afterwards in order to examine the effects of our actions.</p>
<p>「Curse you! Curssseee yyouuuuu!!」</p>
<p>That single strike removed half his life force. He had no choice but to take a knee as blood spilled out of his newly opened wound.</p>
<p>Wait, he’s <i>still</i> not dead!? Holy shit! Why the hell is he still alive after having his heart literally cut in half? Damn stubborn old man, just die already!</p>
<p>I was surprised that we didn’t manage to finish him off, but all was good. Our efforts hadn't gone to waste.</p>
<p>『We did it Fran.』</p>
<p>「Nn! Ultimate obtained.」</p>
<p>The only problem with our newfound secret technique was that it could only be used under a specific set of circumstances. We wouldn’t use it in any sort of cramped environment, so it probably wasn’t going to be all that useful whenever we went to the dungeon we’d been planning to check out.</p>
<p>Well, that only applied to the attack as a whole though. We could still use parts of it. That pseudo-sword draw technique? Yeah, I could see us using that all the time. Unlike the pain in the ass stuff you’d see in real life back in Japan, the sword draw technique Fran had devised was actually practical. It could be used for more than just a horizontal slash from one’s waist, and the blade would actually accelerate far more quickly than usual when pulled from its sheath. Moveover, the technique had great synergy with the Weight Boost skill when used with a vertical slash.</p>
<p>It looked like Magic Poison Fang was doing its job too. Rynford’s state now claimed him to be envenomed. That said though. he had Resistance to Abnormal Status Conditions and Regeneration so he wasn’t actually taking all that much damage. That said, the fact that we’d more or less nullified the effects of Regeneration meant that he was now far more vulnerable to all the other combatants’ attacks. In other words, he was pretty much screwed.</p>
<p>「Don’t let the opportunity Fran’s given us go to waste!」</p>
<p>「Mmph.」</p>
<p>「Great job, Miss Fran!」</p>
<p>「Orders acknowledged!」</p>
<p>「I’ll show you what it means to have a Dwarf’s strength!」</p>
<p>「Hahahaha! These guys’ve all got some fight in em, but that’ll have to wait. Right now, it’s your turn, you old shit!」</p>
<p>「Do your best everyone!」</p>
<p>The all star team followed Amanda’s orders and focus fired Rynford. We wanted to join them, but that little trump card of ours had caused my durability to plummet. I wasn’t able to heal up enough in time to join them even with Instant Regeneration. Fran was pretty much completely out of mana too, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Rynford’s left arm was mauled by a spear as the rest of his body was pierced by countless magic swords and struck over and over again by an unrelenting whip. He was then lifted off the ground by one of Colbert’s uppercuts, only to have his right leg smashed back down and pulverized by the Guildmaster’s hammer.</p>
<p>「Gugagagagagaaaahhhh! Y-You sons of bitchesss!!!」</p>
<p>「The finishing blow is mine!」</p>
<p>「Damned traitor…!」</p>
<p>Zerrosreed’s assault had ended up removing his other leg and caused him to crumple onto the ground. Turned out the Beserker really had been going for the finisher. Bastard was trying to use his Cannibalism skill to make himself even stronger.</p>
<p>But luckily, it turned out that the battle had still yet to end.</p>
<p>「Hoooowlll!」</p>
<p>Urushi imitated Fran’s actions and dashed straight down from somewhere way up high. He drove his fangs into Rynford’s neck and gave it a good tear before plummeting back into the shadows the moment he was about to faceplant.</p>
<p>Damn boy! You totally just stole the spotlight right there!</p>
<p>「Graaaaggh… Why… Not like this…」</p>
<p>And leaving only those four words, Rynford breathed his last.</p>
<p>「Oh god fucking damn it! Stupid god damn dog got in my way again!!」</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>[1] This is a minor technicality with the Japanese language that normally isn’t enforced. 刀 (pronounced katana or tou) refers to swords with one edge, whereas 剣 (pronounced tsurugi or ken) refers to swords with two edges. Note that these meanings are actually relatively vague and the latter in particular is often broken and just used for swords in general, hence why it was translated as just Sword Arts up until this point. Now that the author has made the distinction, it will be translated as Double Edged Sword Arts going forward. Note that this may still be incorrect, and it could actually just be Sword Arts with certain types of swords having their own categories. Also note that 刀 (single edged sword) is often used to refer to the Japanese Katana in particular. Context clues in this case make it seem like it’s for single edged swords in general, but in other cases, it could just mean Katana Arts. Another note is that I forgot I was going to translate the “(Weapon) Arts” one as “Way of the (Weapon).” Since it completely slipped my mind for the past month or so, I’m going to hold off on it and keep “(Weapon) Arts” for consistency’s sake for the time being. I’ll change it sometime down the line if the author continues to fiddle with minor connotations. I also only now realized that I forgot to mention that the “Arts” part of “(Weapon) Arts” alludes to the “Arts” in “Martial Arts.”</p>
<p>[2] The sword drawing technique referenced here and later in the chapter is “Battoujutsu.” You might recognize it if you were a Rurouni Kenshin fan, but it’s basically a technique in which one uses a sheath to draw and swing their blade with ridiculous power, accuracy and speed. As mentioned by Swordbro, it isn’t something that’s really what you’d consider practical in real life.</p>
<p>[3] The word used here is “必殺,” pronounced “hissatsu.” There is no English term that shares the same connotation, so I used the closest game related one I could think of. By ultimate, I mean ultimates in any sort of hero based game. Examples of these include League of Legends, DOTA, and Overwatch. Ultimates are ridiculously powerful, signature techniques that serve to define the character they belong to. The Japanese term used here tends to allude to being a finishing move/insta kill. A popular example would be the Giga Drill Breaker.</p>

		<p><b>132. Rynford's Demise<br>
</b><br>
Urushi’s attack functioned as the finishing blow; Rynford was deprived of his life force and left only the ability to voice one final hateful cry before passing away. His body promptly reacted to his passing. His flesh began peeling off his muscles and his corpse rapidly decomposed into a fine ash.</p>
<p><span id="more-563"></span></p>
<p>His end was abrupt, so abrupt, in fact, that it almost seemed underwhelming.</p>
<p>「Whimper…」</p>
<p>Urushi popped out from the shadows as Rynford’s remains continued to degrade. The combination of his pain filled whimper and the blood dripping from his mouth indicated that something wasn’t quite right.</p>
<p>『What happened boy? You alright?』</p>
<p>「Rynford’s fault?」</p>
<p>「Whipmer…」</p>
<p>We quickly peeked into his maw and found the source of his pain. The large wolf's fangs were in a sorry state. Ever last bit of his jaw seemed to have been suspect to some sort of damage. Worst of all were his canines, which had been torn out altogether. Their now empty sockets had even started to hemorrhage.</p>
<p>Despite all the damages incurred, I couldn’t really say I was even the slightest bit surprised. The attack Fran and I had used was one that came with enough drawbacks to completely wreck my blade. Urushi had copied us, so it only made sense for something similar to happen to his fangs.</p>
<p>『Don’t be pushing yourself too hard now, alright?』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>「But, actions performed were cool.」</p>
<p>「Bark!」</p>
<p>I quickly patched him up by throwing a few heals at him.</p>
<p>〈Fran has leveled up.〉</p>
<p>〈Fran has leveled…〉</p>
<p>The battle had ended, so the System Announcer chimed in with a few notifications.</p>
<p>Rynford had been worth a tonne of experience. Fran managed to gain three levels; she hit level forty despite the fact that the exp had ended up getting split nine ways.</p>

<p>The Evil Resistance skill looked like it was something that’d resulting from all the damage she’d just taken. Her new title was pretty interesting as well. Appraising it ended up giving me the following results.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Evil Killer: A title bestowed upon those that have felled Evil Beings.<br>
Effect: Grants the user the “Evil Killer” skill.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>It seemed to be the type of title you got from killing some sort of super strong enemy as opposed to just killing a certain number of weaker enemies.</p>
<p>More importantly was the fact that she was about to hit her level cap. Thinking about what would happen filled me with curiosity. I couldn’t wait.</p>
<p>Naturally, Fran wasn’t the only one to level up. The same had happened to Urushi.</p>

_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Looked like Urushi had managed to get himself a pair of new skills too. Wait, Evil Resistance? I don’t recall him taking nearly as much damage as Fran… Hmm… I guess it was probably because of Prey Absorption. The skill would let him absorb a portion of the abilities of anything he ate, and I guess he did technically ingest Rynford’s flesh and blood when he finished him off, so that's probably where he got that.</p>
<p>There doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with him, but would it perhaps be better to have him not eat Evil Beings from now on?</p>
<p>『Alright, that’s done and over with, so we should probably be going after Zeraise now.』</p>
<p>（Nn.）</p>
<p>The only issue was that we had absolutely no idea where he was. I really wish we’d managed to get Rynford to tell us or somet- Oh wait. We could probably just get it out of that Zerrosreed guy instead.</p>
<p>『Or… not? Where’d he go?』</p>
<p>「Nn? Vanished.」</p>
<p>「Huh? Oh! Darn it! The Berserker got away!」</p>
<p>Amanda had overheard Fran’s muttering, so she ended up giving the surroundings a quick once over that ultimately culminated in a frustrated shout.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>When the hell? Didn’t he literally just try finishing Rynford off?</p>
<p>「It looks like he might have the Anti-Perception skill…」</p>
<p>「Oh, I see him! He’s right over there!」</p>
<p>The spot Amanda was pointing to was about fifty meters from where we were. Holy crap, when the hell did he leave…?</p>
<p>「The last hit should've been mine! I could’ve gotten my hands on a good chunk of that shitty old geezer’s power! Everything would’ve gone perfectly if not for that god damned meddling dog! Fuck this, I’m out!」</p>
<p>「You won’t be getting away!」</p>
<p>Colbert immediately dashed after Zerrosreed, but the berserker had been one step ahead of him.</p>
<p>「Hahaha! Zeraise’s up in the Alchemist’s Guild if you need him, by the way, so goodbye to you!」</p>
<p>「Huh? He teleported?」</p>
<p>As evidenced by Amanda’s surprised response, Zerrosreed had teleported himself away. Appearance wise, it looked pretty much identical to the stuff I could use. Rynford did something similar just a bit earlier as well, so my guess was that it was the effect of some sort of skill derived from the Evil Arts. Neither Zerrosreed nor Rynford seemed to have been able to use the skill on more than one occasion though, so it probably had a few constraints on it or something.</p>
<p>「Tsk. I should’ve expected as much from someone with such a big bounty on his head, but he sure is good at running away. I’ll definitely get him next time!」</p>
<p>It looked like he managed to escape, but I figured we could still get him if we had everyone give us a hand. That said though, I decided to put the idea aside for the time being as capturing Zeraise was much more important. We had no idea as to whether or not Zerrosreed was telling the truth, but he did already have a pretty good track record as far as betrayal went, so chances were that he was. Having some of us split off to go after Zeraise served in his favour, so there was all the more reason for him not to lie.</p>
<p>「The air still gives off a sense of evil…」</p>
<p>Forrund’s words momentarily cleared my mind of all my thoughts regarding Zeraise and Zerrosreed, and reminded me of the Evil Crystals Rynford had been using. I didn't really know if they'd cause anything bad to happen without any outside fluence, but it probably wasn’t a good idea to just leave them be anyways.</p>
<p>「Might still be here. Evil Crystals.」</p>
<p>「What Evil Crystals?」</p>
<p>Fran quickly answered the Guildmaster and began talking about the crystals Rynford had been using. Her explanation immediately led everyone around her to turn pale and immediately start digging through the temple's debris.</p>
<p>Charlotte played a pretty key role. Apparently, she was fairly sharp as far as evil energies were concerned, so she managed to find both crystals almost immediately. They were buried under a bunch of other stuff, but Gamud was pretty good at earth magic, so he managed to get them out in a jiffy.</p>
<p>「So these are the Evil Crystals you were talking about…」</p>
<p>「Evil energies thinner?」</p>
<p>Fran had been on point. The Evil Crystals were giving off much less energy that they’d been prior to Rynford's transformation.</p>
<p>「You said that these were placed within the temple’s grounds?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Rynford performed ritual.」</p>
<p>「I see…」</p>
<p>「Have you figured anything out, Charlotte?」</p>
<p>「I’m not too confident in my theory's correctness, but…」</p>
<p>According to Charlotte, temples effectively functioned to allow communication with the Divine Realm in which the Gods resided. Oracles and other similar individuals could use the connection in order to create a path, which in turn was used for job changes and the like. A job change in particular involved making use of the Divine Realm’s axioms in order to overwrite the data that pertained to one’s job.</p>
<p>The paths were governed over by the Gods themselves, so it was impossible for normal human beings to use them as they pleased.</p>
<p>Charlotte had deduced that the Evil Crystals had the ability to warp said path, and instead direct it towards the sealed off Evil God.</p>
<p>A few of the people that’d fought with us, Colbert included, immediately voiced their objections, but they were quickly overruled by Amanda and Gamud, who stated that it could be possible. Very little was known about the Evil God's powers, and thus, warping the path could potentially fall within the realm of the Evil God's capabilities.</p>
<p>Apparently, the Evil God had been split into a great number of smaller pieces upon its defeat. The core in particular had been taken into the Divine Realm, where it was placed under surveillance. We had no real way of confirming whether or not that was actually truth, but we assumed it was as that was what the legends said.</p>
<p>Either way, we decided to destroy the Evil Crystals. They probably wouldn’t see any decent use even if we did just leave them here, and not a single one of the individuals presented objected to the idea, so we had everyone join in and quickly smashed the crystals to bits.</p>
<p>Alright, that’s another task done. All that’s left for us to do now is hunt down Zeraise.</p>
<p>「Amanda. Need help with something.」</p>
<p>「Sure, what is it?」</p>
<p>「Can request anything? No objections?」</p>
<p>「There’s no way I’d turn you of all people down, Fran. So, out with it. What did you need me to do?」</p>
<p>Luckily, Amanda was more than willing to cooperate, so we quickly told her and everyone else about Zeraise. Specifically, we explained that he was the mastermind behind all this, that he was still at large, and that he still seemed to be up to something.</p>
<p>「I am surprised to hear that Zeraise has yet to leave the city… I shall make good use of this opportunity and pay him back in full force for involving my brothers in his schemes.」</p>
<p>「I hadn’t heard his name in quite some time. I’d assumed that he’d already dropped dead.」</p>
<p>「We may be able to encounter the Berserker should we track him down.」</p>
<p>「I’m going to have to give those baddies a bit of punishment for the children’s sake.」</p>
<p>「Indeed.」</p>
<p>It seemed that everyone was willing and ready give solving this whole case a go, so we had Colbert, the person most familiar with the city’s layout, lead us over the Alchemist’s guild. The party we moved with was one of extraordinary strength. With them around, taking Zeraise in would be easy as pie.</p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><strong>133. The Alchemist’s Guild</strong></p>
<p>It didn’t take long for us to arrive at the Alchemist’s Guild. We ran into a few Evil Beings along the way, but they all ended up dying instantly seeing as how our party’s specs were what they were. We had practically mowed straight through the city. The only person that had trouble keeping up was Charlotte, but we quickly rectified that issue by having her join Fran on Urushi.</p>
<p><span id="more-569"></span></p>
<p>I couldn’t help but accuse our the wolf companion of being a huge pervert. He refused to let men ride him, but was more than willing to shoulder a pretty girl or two. It might’ve also been because he thought of her as weak though, so I couldn’t actually say for sure. I mean, he was totally okay with the orphanage's children after all, regardless of gender.</p>
<p>Thinking about it made me arrive at the conclusion that he seemed to think that men should be able to manage without any sort of assistance, an opinion quite similar to my own. I wonder… Did the summoning process intentionally pull in a creature with a personality that resonated with mine or something like that?</p>
<p>「I have eyes on the Alchemist’s Guild, but …」</p>
<p>「Oi, ain’t that our guild’s bunch right there?」</p>
<p>The situation was basically exactly as Colbert and Gamud had described; a melee had broken out in front of the Alchemist’s Guild. I could tell at a glance that the adventurers present were fighting a group of things, but I couldn’t immediately discern what those so called things were as they didn’t seem to be Evil Beings. I’d almost thought them to be the undead at first, but I could feel them giving off some sort of life force, so that couldn’t have been the case.</p>
<p>I didn’t manage to figure out what the things were before getting within appraisal range, so I just went and did that instead of thinking about it. They turned out to be Demonic Beings. In other words, they were the same species as Zerrosreed. Unlike the Berserker, however, the Demonic Beings the adventurers were fighting weren’t really all that strong. Hence, I was much more interested in their abnormal status conditions than anything else about them. Apparently, they were in the Impaired state. The hell was that supposed to mean?</p>
<p>「Let’s go back up the adventurers for now.」</p>
<p>「Indeed!」</p>
<p>「Here goes!」</p>
<p>Colbert and Gamud had both been a full step ahead of Amanda, as they’d already started charging the moment she started issuing orders. Phillip and Amanda jumped in immediately after, while Fran and Forrund wordlessly brought up the rear. Urushi didn’t join the fray, and instead sat around on standby as Charlotte’s guard.</p>
<p>「I’m here to help!」</p>
<p>「Guildmaster!」</p>
<p>Turned out that Eugene had joined the fray as well, as a member of the Adventurer’s Guild, of course. He had been firing off spells into the crowd in order to defeat the Demonic Beings.</p>
<p>「Eugene?」</p>
<p>「You’re here too, Fran?」</p>
<p>「What happened? Want explanation.」</p>
<p>「Well, you see…」</p>
<p>The Adventurer’s Guild was first notified of the Alchemist’s Guild’s plight about an hour back. One of the older alchemists that had kept in touch with Eugene even after the incident had barged into the Adventurer’s Guild in a panic and requested his friends’ assistance.</p>
<p>Apparently, one of the Alchemist’s Guild’s higher ups had been working together with an alchemist outside their ranks in order to conduct illegal experiments. The experiment's participant then went on to using his concoctions in order to seize control over the Alchemist’s Guild’s upper stratum. He then forced those with less influence to assist in the experimentation.</p>
<p>Specifically, the less influential alchemists had ended up being forced to function as lab rats. The old man had managed to escape his colleagues’ fate as he had coincidentally holed himself up in his room and continued his research without exposing himself to the guild’s other members.</p>
<p>The illegal experiments worked towards the goal of obtaining more information about Demonization, the process of imbuing magic stones inside of human beings in order to strengthen them. Interestingly enough, Demonization was in fact the precise topic that had led to the expulsion of Eugene’s disciple.</p>
<p>That disciple’s name had of course been Zerais. The Alchemist’s Guild had supposedly washed its hands of Zerais’ experiments the moment he was expelled, but one of the guild’s higher ups had not only preserved all the data obtained, but also offered the fugitive both shelter from the authorities and the opportunity to continue his research.</p>
<p>The man seemed to have two reasons for his actions. The first was apparently that he believed the research to be of monetary value, governments and militaries would pay out the ass for that kind of information. The latter seemed to be that he, as an alchemist, thought that it would be wasteful to throw away all the useful data obtained.</p>
<p>「Then, those things. Former alchemists?」</p>
<p>「Precisely. I attempted to have their magic stones removed with the adventurers’ assistance, but unfortunately it was to no avail…」</p>
<p>They’d tried pretty much everything they could think of. They experimented with healing magic, purification magic, surgery, and even brute force, but none of it was to any effect. The demonic beings were much like magic beasts, they would die the moment their magic stones were removed or destroyed. And of course, the human used the demonic being’s base would end up dying as well in the process.</p>
<p>「Can’t communicate?」</p>
<p>「We tried, but again, to no avail. The magic beings appear to have all gone insane.」</p>
<p>Zerrosreed seemed to have retained his ability to think though. Was that because he’d had the magic stones transplanted into him as an Evil Being or something?</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Half had already been let loose by the time we arrived, but managed to encircle the Alchemist’s Guild’s building before the other half escaped its confines.」</p>
<p>It was quite difficult for the adventurers to capture the Demonic Beings alive. There were a few small fry here and there, but many could use magic. Asking adventurers to take in something that powerful without killing it first was more or less equivalent to asking them to off themselves.</p>
<p>Hence, they’d only tried removing magic stones from the demons they happened to accidentally render incapable of combat.</p>
<p>「So we have no choice but to kill them?」</p>
<p>「Exactly.」</p>
<p>Eugene responded to Amanda’s question with a nod.</p>
<p>Well, I guess we kinda have to lend him a hand or two. I’m feeling a bit paranoid that one of them is going to suddenly power up the same way Rynford did, so yeah.</p>
<p>（Master. Gunning for magic stones.）</p>
<p>『Right, yeah, good point.』</p>
<p>Fran immediately dashed into the melee and swung me at one of the Demonic Beings, to which I responded by promptly absorbing its magic stone on contact.</p>

<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>And of course, I gave his status a quick peak right before he died. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to get my hands on the Painting skill he had, and to make matters worse, he was only worth a single magic stone point.</p>
<p>『Let’s hurry up and get this over with.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We followed Amanda and went even deeper into the mob of Demonic Beings, but much to my dismay, not a single one of them was worth more than just one measly magic stone point.</p>
<p>The moment I started grumbling my complaints was the the moment I spotted a Demonic Being that seemed to stand out from its peers.</p>
<p>「Strong.」</p>
<p>『Sure looks like it. His stats are pretty high, and he isn’t Impaired either.』</p>
<p>He was much stronger and faster than the other Demonic Beings. And, although it sat at a measly level one, he did technically have the Sword Arts skill. Fran ended up disposing of him in an instant anyways, but he still was pretty strong when compared all the others.</p>
<p>And you know what? Best part is that he gave more than just one magic stone point. Killing him and ended up getting me <i>three whole points</i>. Does the amount of points I get vary based off their state? Or is it something else instead?</p>
<p>「Will find even stronger Demonic Beings.」</p>
<p>『Go for it.』</p>
<p>We ended up charging straight for the Alchemist’s Guild’s building despite it basically being the enemy’s HQ.</p>
<p>「Any plans as far as taking control over the building goes, Gamud?」</p>
<p>「There ain’t really anything to take control of. There don’t seem to be any human beings inside the place anymore.」</p>
<p>According to Amanda and Gamud, the Guild’s interior was basically devoid of human life. There was some evil energy flowing out of from within it, but the amount was miniscule relative to what we felt back at the temple, so I didn’t really think it to be an issue.</p>
<p>Urushi, however, thought otherwise.</p>
<p>「Growl.」</p>
<p>He barked a low, guttural bark while staring straight at the building before us.</p>
<p>「Is something wrong, Urushi?」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>The wolf answered Amanda with a pair of more vigilant barks.</p>
<p>「Something coming.」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Are you certain? My senses are failing to react if so…」</p>
<p>Neither Forrund nor Philip were able to sense whatever it was Urushi was detecting. In other words, this was probably the work of his newly acquired Evil Detection skill, as no one else present happened to have it.</p>
<p>The skill was still just level one, but it seemed quite effective seeing as how he was able to outdo several A ranked adventurers in terms of detection.</p>
<p>「I sense it now as well!」</p>
<p>「Really? You too, Charlotte?」</p>
<p>「Really. It seems to be coming from somewhere underground. Right, Urushi?」</p>
<p>「Woof woof woof!」</p>
<p>「Well, your impressions seem to match up, so I don’t see any reason to be doubting you.」</p>
<p>「Incoming attack detected.」</p>
<p>「It seems so. I can feel it in my fists.」</p>
<p>Everyone else finally started picking up whatever Urushi had sensed after about a minute or so.</p>
<p>Whatever was coming for us seemed a lot weaker than I’d initially anticipated. It was only giving off as much evil energy as your average Evil Being. However, I was still quite curious about it as it seemed to carry with it a sort of artificial nature. The part that piqued my interest the most was how it felt a lot more like clump of pure evil energy than an actual living thing.</p>
<p>All my questions were answered three minutes later, as whatever we'd detected finally made its way outside the Alchemist’s Guild’s confines.</p>
<p>「Is that a golem?」</p>
<p>「Huh. I can’t appraise the damn thing, it’s got Appraisal Blocking.」</p>
<p>Gamud was unable to learn anything about the golem despite having his appraisal skill leveled to 3. I tried taking a quick glance at it with the Eye of Empyrea, but even then, the only thing I got was its name. Apparently, it was a Magic Stone Soldier.</p>
<p>「Growl.」</p>
<p>『Get ready. Looks like it’s shifting right into combat mode.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>

    < /br>

        
		<p><b>134. Zeraise’s Goal</b></p>
<p>Five Magic Stone Soldiers emerged from within the Alchemist Guild’s depths. For some odd reason, they seemed to give off a heavy, intimidating air despite looking like a bunch of armoured gorillas.</p>
<p><span id="more-578"></span></p>
<p>They could also be described as golems with elongated arms. Either way, their bodies were made purely of a red and black, crystalline substance.</p>
<p>Their short legs made it so that their longer arms extended all the way down to the ground. A bit of further observation led me to realize that they very much resembled the robotic soldiers that guarded a certain castle in the sky.</p>
<p>None of the five gave off even the slightest bit of life force. It looked like they really were golems as opposed to powersuits or the like.</p>
<p>「Be careful. I can’t appraise these damn things for the life of me. There’s no way for us to tell what they have up their sleeves.」</p>
<p>「All the more reason to attack them before they’ve a chance to attack us!」</p>
<p>Although Colbert kind of seemed like the kind of guy that’d enjoy charging right in, he was experienced enough to understand that running up to and punching an enemy whose abilities he knew little about was not exactly the best idea. Hence, his preemptive attack instead took the form of a skill somewhat similar to sword arts’ Sonic Wave. That is, he fired off a shockwave in the Goldems’ direction by punching the air.</p>
<p>The shockwave flew straight towards them. I could tell at a glance that it had more than enough power to mangle a hobgoblin and grind it to pieces.</p>
<p>But it had no effect.</p>
<p>Colbert’s shockwave almost seemed to vanish altogether the moment it came into contact with the Magic Stone Soldier standing in front. It hadn’t even taken any damage from the attack.</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell if it’d used a skill or invoked some sort of magic, but in either case, it seemed as if it hadn’t been affected at all. Man, not being able to appraise something is a huge pain in the ass.</p>
<p>Seeing the Magic Stone Soldier’s ability had caused our allies to halt in precaution. Four of our five enemies immediately took note of our hesitation and began swinging their arms in a large arc. It seemed that they were in the midst of gathering magical energy there within.</p>
<p>「Watch out! They’re mounting an assault!」</p>
<p>「Oh Barrier of Wind.」</p>
<p>「Howl! Granbolt!」</p>
<p>『Fire Wall.』</p>
<p>We setup our defenses the moment the golems unleashed their attacks.</p>
<p>「They’re using composite attributes!?」</p>
<p>「That thing was as strong as a high tier spell!」</p>
<p>We had managed to ward off the golems’ barrage, but the brute force that they came with had left quite an impression nonetheless. The wind bullets they fired had been about as powerful as what you’d expect from Storm Magic, but that wasn’t all. They’d also thrown a few rarer elements into the mix, namely ice/snow, lightning, and lava.</p>
<p>The fact that golems were able to use magic was, in and of itself, a pretty rare occurrence, so seeing them use powerful spells derived from rare elements made the whole situation seem outright unrealistic.</p>
<p>Both Amanda and Gamud had shouted in surprise, and although Forrund refrained from speech, I could tell that he felt the same based on the fact that he’d gone wide eyed.</p>
<p>「So, how are you finding my Magic Stone Soldiers?」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>『Is that a hologram? Or is he using illusion magic or something?』</p>
<p>A man had materialized between us and the golems right after Amanda had another one of spells do nothing whatsoever to an enemy golem.</p>
<p>At first, I’d thought that he’d teleported here or something, but I'd very obviously been wrong. His translucent form and the occasional static that seemed to pulse through his body both evidenced that he was obviously just an illusion.</p>
<p>The man was so good looking that it pissed me the hell off. He looked to be about twenty, and had the ever so rumoured blonde hair and blue eyes. His stature was a bit on the smaller side, just enough so that I almost felt the urge to warn him to be wary of pedophiles.</p>
<p>「Who?」</p>
<p>「Zerais!」</p>
<p>「Oh, long time no see, Master of mine.」</p>
<p>Eugene ended up shouting out the man’s name and revealing to us his identity, but I still had a hard time digesting it. Like, was that seriously him? I really didn’t expect him to be so young and whatnot. I’d always pictured Zerais as an older dude in a lab coat.</p>
<p>「You haven’t really changed much.」</p>
<p>「Oh that? That’s just because I happened to get my hands on a bit of demon blood.」</p>
<p>Ohhh, I get it. If you inject yourself with the blood of a longer living race, you’ll end up looking much younger than you actually are.</p>
<p>「Are you the reason the guild’s alchemists are the way they are?」</p>
<p>「Well yeah. I put them all through my Demonization experiments, but as you can see, they ended up turning into failures. It looks like you need someone that’s really strong, both in mind and body, if you want to actually get something out of shoving a magic stone inside of a human being. All the small fry I tried the experiment on ended up dying because their bodies rejected the magic stones. The ones lucky enough to live all ended up losing their minds. They might as well be zombies with the way they are, but oh well, I guess that’s fine too since they’re pretty easy to control.」</p>
<p>Zerais proudly started to blab about everything he’d done. The look he had on his face pissed me off to no end. He seemed to love attention, so he ended up giving us a bunch of information for pretty much no reason at all.</p>
<p>「I still need just a bit more work on the Demonization end of things, but those Magic Stone Soldiers I’ve got over there are pretty much complete already. How are you finding them? Strong, right? I figured out how to make them when I was doing research on demons. I couldn’t really get things to go the way I wanted at first, but one of my collaborators gave me a bit of a hand and helped me push them towards completion.」</p>
<p>「Rynford?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. Oh wait, I’ve got a pretty good idea who you are. You’re that adventurer girl, Fran, right?」</p>
<p>「Rynford? Who’s that?」</p>
<p>Hmmm, I see, so Eugene didn’t even know Rynford existed.</p>
<p>「He’s one of the Evil God’s servants, and the guy behind this whole mess. Though, I can’t really say I didn’t lend him a hand or two. He taught me Evil Arts and several methods for handling evil energies, so I paid him back by teaching him all about alchemy and magic stones. Anyway, I know the night’s been a bit of a rowdy one, but why don’t you join in on all the festivities? Oh yeah, I just realized I lied a bit. I think I did end up participating in planning tonight out, since I did need two or three thousand souls, you see.」</p>
<p>Zerais’ smile was so pure and serene that it almost seemed like his actions hadn’t caused him to feel even the slightest bit of guilt.</p>
<p>「W-Why would you…」</p>
<p>Eugene narrowly managed to squeeze out half a question as he stared his disciple down. The half insectman's face had clearly gone pale.</p>
<p>「Hmmm… Well, to sum it up, I guess it’s cause I wanted to leave proof of the fact that I existed.」</p>
<p>「What? I don’t understand what you’re saying.」</p>
<p>「I guess I’ll remove a step’s worth of abstraction then. My goal is to leave become so famous that my name goes down in history. I’d like for people to remember me, even a thousand years down the line.」</p>
<p>「Are you serious, Zerais…? You’re willing to throw away people’s lives for that mundane a reason…?」</p>
<p>Eugene’s face stiffened. He took on a much more teacher-like air despite the fact that didn’t seem to be able to comprehend the fact that his former disciple had gone mad.</p>
<p>「When was it…? When was it that you were first led astray…?」</p>
<p>「When? Well, I was always like this. The only difference is that I used to be a bit better behaved is all. You know, Master, I really do appreciate all you’ve done for me. Your lessons are the only reason why I’m even starting to get close to accomplishing my dream, you know?」</p>
<p>Eugene was honestly a pretty good, down to earth guy, but as a result, he couldn’t understand why his apprentice was acting the way he was. He failed to comprehend his malice, no, his outright lack of concern for anyone but himself.</p>
<p>In other words, I was trying to say that Eugene was far too kind and naive. Though it sounded like I was kind of shitting on the guy, I really meant it as a good thing. Eugene’s kindness and naivety seems to have been what’s gotten him to where he is today. My guess was that he had believed that Zerais had been somewhere out in the world atoning for his sins with his day to day actions.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>The way I saw it though, Zerais hadn’t even the slightest desire to repent. He was more like a rotting apple. In fact, he’d gotten so rotten that he started draining the life of the other, healthier apples around him. At this point, I’d say it was even fair to start calling him a mutated apple. He seemed pretty normal from the outside, but his insides were a total mess of toxic sludge. Anyone that tried to eat him would probably instantly die of food poisoning, so it’d be best to throw him out altogether. Yup, we needed to seek him out and eliminate him right away.</p>
<p>「Besides, what’s so abnormal about wanting to get famous anyway? I’m pretty sure it’s a normal thing pretty much everyone wants.」</p>
<p>「You’re right, Zerais. Fame is something commonly sought after, but that does not mean that you can just go around doing whatever it is you want. You cannot simply trod on the lives of other human beings! Are you truly satisfied with leaving behind a name soiled by a legacy of infamy?」</p>
<p>「Like I care. I don’t mind being infamous at all. In fact, I’d rather be infamous than just famous, you know?」</p>
<p>「Why? Demanding Reason.」</p>
<p>「Well, Fran, why don’t I put it this way? Have you ever heard the tales of King Yvel and Saint Myurell? If not, then what of Dragonslayer Sigmund?」</p>
<p>「Know none.」</p>
<p>「See? That’s exactly my point. All three of the people I just mentioned were outstanding individuals famous for their accomplishments. The first had worked with a group of knights to hold back a horde of goblins 1,000,000 strong. In his time, he was known as The Heroic King. The second was a wandering saint, she travelled the lands and spent her entire life healing its people. The third was an adventurer that threw away his life in order to free the continent of Khrome from a Dragonic Lord that would’ve otherwise brought about its destruction. Their achievements were all quite amazing, don’t you think?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Amazing.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, but despite that, you didn’t know about them until just now. In fact, few do, their names are unsung. But, what if I ask you about Trismegeist the Rebel? You know him?」</p>
<p>「Heard of.」</p>
<p>「Of course you do. Pretty much everyone knows him. And now you get it, right?」</p>
<p>Wait, who the hell is Trismegeist?</p>
<p>『Hey Fran, who’s Trismegeist?』</p>
<p>（Famous alchemist. Really bad person. Destroyed continent of Goldishia.）</p>
<p>Fran quickly briefed me about the guy and his deeds.</p>
<p>Trismegeist was apparently a man that existed long in the past. He was a king, but not just any king. The kingdom he ruled over was so vast and powerful that it effectively had control over an entire continent. Yet, he wasn't satisfied. He had tried to brith an almighty magic beast for the sake of achieving a single goal: world domination. And of course, his ambitions weren’t ones that could be achieved through normal means. Hence, he unsealed the Evil God’s heart and attempted to use its power.</p>
<p>The magic beast that resulted from such a decision was immensely powerful, so much so that it ended up obliterating an entire continent and almost all its people. Said magic beast continued to grow in strength by eating the very land itself. It got so large that it became capable of engulfing every last bit of landmass that remained in a single, fell swoop. The people despaired, but the Gods descended and offered them salvation. They created a massive barrier and entrapped the continent sized magic beast, the Abyss Eater. It’s said that the Abyss Eater continues to thrive within the barrier to this day.</p>
<p>On a side note, the Gods cursed Trismegeist in order to force him atone for his sins. Specifically, they provided him immortality while also leaving him within the barrier, hence forcing him to suffer as the beast consumes his flesh in perpetuity.</p>
<p>I’ve no real way of knowing whether or not the story is a factual depiction, especially seeing as how it’s used a bedtime story in order to discourage kids from misbehaving. But still, holy shit that’s terrifying. Like, damn, that is one hell of a curse. Gods, you scary as hell.</p>
<p>「Boy am I jealous of Trismegeist. Must be nice to be him!」</p>
<p>「What are you saying, Zerais!? That’s ridiculous! Wait…Don’t tell me you plan on undoing one of the Evil God’s seals…?」</p>
<p>「You know, that’s actually exactly what I had in mind. Don’t you worry though, I’m not planning on doing something as drastic as freeing a piece as major as its heart.」</p>
<p>「Are you trying to say that you think you can take control of it!?」</p>
<p>「In fact, yeah, yeah, I am. I can do it you know? I mean, just look at me! The only problem is that my little old collaborator had to end up dying on me before we actually got a chance to take a stab at it. I haven’t gotten enough souls either, and I can’t actually undo the seal myself. I mean, I may be gifted, but I’m not actually capable of using the Evil Arts.」</p>
<p>Whew.</p>
<p>「But you see, the thing is, I’m starting to get real annoyed with Fran over there, you know? First she takes the package I was having shipped over, then she got in the way when I tried having a few of my employees deal with the orphanage and whatnot, and now she’s even helped kill Rynford and his merry little friends.」</p>
<p>The orphanage? Wait, so he was the one after Io’s recipe?</p>
<p>「Want recipe why?」</p>
<p>「Nothing special. Just a bit of idle curiosity, you know?」</p>
<p>「Curiosity?」</p>
<p>「Yup, curiosity. At first, it was because Bluke wanted to know about it and wouldn’t stop nagging me, so I started by embezzling all money that normally would’ve been used on the orphanage's operating expenses. You see, it costs money for me to get my hands on magic stones and equipment and the like, so I didn’t see any reason for me not to. I figured that they might start selling off the children if they didn’t have enough money to get by, and I was definitely in need of extra lab rats. It was totally a win win situation, right? I decided to pay the orphanage a quick visit in person a bit later on so I could start checking out the children ahead of time, but I then ended up realizing that the dishes that they served there were really quite strange, you see.」</p>
<p>「Dishes?」</p>
<p>「I mean, look at their ingredients. The stuff that they served there was obviously way better tasting than it really should’ve been. I thought that they might have access to some sort of technology that’d let them inject mana into their ingredients or something. Turned out that I was completely off the mark though.」</p>
<p>Zerais lightly laughed as he recalled his mistake.</p>
<p>Holy shit, this guy’s a huge fucking asshole. We can’t actually get to him, or even find him right no, but that didn't really seem like too much of a problem at all. Amanda was giving off an incredible amount of bloodlust, so I figured he’d probably just made it to the top of her hit list. No mistaking it, he was totally in for a fate far worse than death.</p>
<p>「Anyway, this conversation’s dragged on for a bit too long already, so I’m going to be heading out. Oh yeah, and, just in case you were still wondering, I’m not actually at the guild anymore.」</p>
<p>「Running away?」</p>
<p>「Yes I am. My plan’s a total failure now that Rynford’s dead. I’d been planning to have his mass produced Evil Beings kill a bunch of people so I could use their souls to summon a piece of the Evil God’s flesh. It would’ve worked too, especially if Rynford had managed to draw from the Evil God’s power. Oh well, there’s always a next time. Have fun playing around with my Magic Stone Soldiers. Buh bye.」</p>
<p>Zerais' projection gave a quick wave and disapeared immediately after he finished speaking.</p>
<p>『Seems like he was telling the truth. I can’t sense anyone in the guild at all.』</p>
<p>（Urushi. Can’t chase?）</p>
<p>（Whimper.）</p>
<p>『Tsk. God damn it.』</p>
<p>（Woof…）</p>
<p>『Oh uh… whoops. My bad Urushi, I wasn’t trying to say it was your fault or anything.』</p>
<p>Oh well, can’t be helped I guess. Let’s deal with these guys for now and figure out what to do about Zerais later.</p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>135. Versus: Magic Stone Soldiers</b></p>
<p>「So that was Zerais? He sure was an obnoxious one.」</p>
<p>「I can’t stand the fact that he’s managed to get away.」</p>
<p>「I fail to comprehend the extent to which he belittles the value of the citizen’s lives…」</p>
<p><span id="more-586"></span></p>
<p>「How terrible he is!」</p>
<p>「We’re going to have to deal with these things first if we want to hunt that asshole down though, you know?」</p>
<p>「Right.」</p>
<p>The entire all star cast seemed pretty pissed off at Zerais, but they all assented to the fact that the alchemist had already effectively escaped regardless.</p>
<p>We couldn’t really go after him anymore because we flat out had no idea where he was. Moreover, we kinda needed to take out the Magic Stone Soldiers before they caused any more harm. If we were lucky, we might even be able to get a clue or two out of investigating the alchemist’s guild afterwards.</p>
<p>That said though, defeating them would be a milestone in and of itself. We didn’t know precisely what their abilities did, but they seemed to be able to nullify any sort of ranged attack regardless of whether it was based in might or magic. They didn’t seem to be deploying any sort of barrier or anything like that, so I really had no idea what the hell was going on.</p>
<p>Colbert had tried throwing another ranged martial art or two at the things, but his attacks were once again rendered useless.</p>
<p>「Well, projectiles don't work, so it looks like we're stuck with good old close quarters combat. I'm a lot more durable than you lot, so I'll volunteer myself to go up first.」</p>
<p>Gamud stepped up as he made a declaration whose contents sounded fairly logical. The fully armoured dwarf was the splitting image of a tank. I really couldn’t imagine him going down all that easily, especially if he had a few buffs applied and whatnot.</p>
<p>「Sounds like a plan.」</p>
<p>Amanda assented with a nod.</p>
<p>「Then here I go!」</p>
<p>The guildmaster dashed towards the Magic Stone Soldiers with a huge smile on his face.</p>
<p>He reached one of the golems in a blink of an eye and immediately swung his hammer towards it. His speed was incredible, especially for someone wearing full plate armour.</p>
<p>「Hah, these things react slow as hell!」</p>
<p>The dwarf immediately swung his hammer without using any sort of technique or art and delivered a single forceful blow. Despite him choosing not to apply any sort of skill, the strike still looked powerful enough to smash his target’s head to pieces</p>
<p>But it didn’t.</p>
<p>The noise that the hammer had caused was not that of a smash, but rather, a screech.</p>
<p>「Nuoooooowaaahhhhh!!」</p>
<p>The mallet-like weapon had ended up being forced to a stop right before it was able to make contact with the enemy golem. Gamud was sent flying, four spells on his tail. Fortunately, Phillip managed to block them before they caused him any harm.</p>
<p>「Are you alright, Guildmaster?」</p>
<p>「Ugh… The hell just happened…?」</p>
<p>Gamud seemed pretty confused, which, to be fair, made sense given how far he’d been blown away. The counterattack he’d been hit by was incredibly powerful, as evidenced by the huge dent in his orihalcum armour.</p>
<p>It was a bit unfortunate for him, but we still managed to get something out of it. Namely, Forrund seemed to have figured something out.</p>
<p>「Reflection.」</p>
<p>「Oh, that does seem fairly likely not that you’ve mentioned it.」</p>
<p>Amanda acknowledged the other A ranked adventurer's muttering with an enlightened, knowing tone.</p>
<p>「I think there was a moonlight spell that did something like that. I’ve seen someone use it once before」</p>
<p>「Same.」</p>
<p>Apparently, Moonlight Magic was a branch of magic that specialized in reflecting and invalidating enemy attacks. The Magic Stone Soldiers had already demonstrated that they were capable of all sorts of rare magic, so it actually seemed quite likely for them to be able to use Moonlight Magic as well. The specific behaviour that the golems seemed to be demonstrating was reflection against close ranged attacks and invalidation of longer ranged ones.</p>
<p>Holy shit that stuff is rare though. Like, damn, neither Forrund nor Amanda had seen it more than just once despite their long careers.</p>
<p>「It might be better for us to try wiping out the ones in the rear before attacking the one up front.」</p>
<p>「Agreed.」</p>
<p>We tried following Amanda’s suggestion, but it didn’t work out.</p>
<p>Colbert and Phillip were both immediately blown back the moment they tried engaging one of the golems in the back. In other words, all five units were capable of using Moonlight Magic.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>The golems’ stats didn’t seem all that high, but the properties of their spells made them incredibly difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>「So, anyone here know how to deal with this?」</p>
<p>「Yes.」</p>
<p>「Well, it’s probably not all that easy for them to keep reflecting and invalidating our attacks, so it should show a few openings if we just keep attacking them. Let’s try pelting it with weaker hits for now, ones that wouldn’t really hurt you much when reflected.」</p>
<p>「I see. That does sound rather promising.」</p>
<p>Phillip immediately stepped up for the job. He was wearing a tonne of heavy armour and looked like he could tank as many weaker hits as he wanted.</p>
<p>And so, the experiment commenced. He threw a chain of light stabs at the golems, only to find that one in every few attacks would end up actually hitting its mark. The issue was that the Magic Stone Soldiers were fairly durable, so they didn't end up taking any noticable damage.</p>
<p>Any attack that was strong enough to take the golems down would likely result in at least a few broken bones if reflected. And of course, that applied just as much to Colbert and Gamud as it did to Phillip.</p>
<p>We decided that we could probably join in as well. We wouldn't run into any issues so long as I kept our magic barriers up at max while Fran lightly slashed the Magic Stone Soldiers over and over.</p>
<p>We figured that the reflection spell might not actually activate if our attacks were too weak, so Fran ended up using as much force as she could while making sure to stay within the Magical Barrier’s defensible limits.</p>
<p>And so, with that condition in mind, we rapidly assaulted the closest enemy rear guard whilst completely ignoring all its counters.</p>
<p>The act led us to hear a series of ringing sounds followed by a loud smack.</p>
<p>I guess that means we hit it. Wait… what?</p>
<p>「Huh?」</p>
<p>The familiar sensation of absorbing a magic stone ran through me as the magic stone soldier we hit just flat out poofed.</p>
<p>Ohhhh, I get it. These things are literally soldiers made out of magic stones, which meant I could basically just absorb them as I could any other magic stones. Is this how life feels on easy mode or something? On well, either way, it seemed like I was pretty much the Magic Stone Soldier’s natural predator.</p>
<p>「Woah. What did you just do, Miss Fran?」</p>
<p>「You totally obliterated it in just one hit? Damn.」</p>
<p>「What sort of action did you perform?」</p>
<p>Oh shit. They totally just saw me absorb the magic stone soldiers. Crap, I need to come up with an excuse. I really don’t want to be telling everyone that it was one of my abilities. I didn’t want Forrund taking interest in me, so yeah… I guess we could just say it was because of a skill or something, but I’m not really sure if that’ll fly…</p>
<p>「Come on guys, asking other people about their skills is bad manners.」</p>
<p>「Well, true, but…」</p>
<p>「All that matters is that Fran has a way to beating these things with relative ease.」</p>
<p>「I guess you’re right…」</p>
<p>Luckily, Amanda managed to bail us out.</p>
<p>「In that case, I think it’d be best for us to provide Miss Fran with backup while she eliminates them.」</p>
<p>「Yeah.」</p>
<p>「Acknowledged.」</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for us to dispose of the remaining golems. The task went by especially quickly because the people helping us were so ridiculously strong. They easily held the Magic Stone Soldiers attention as I quickly absorbed them all.</p>
<p>It only took us three minutes to finish off all five Magic Stone Soldiers. Each yielded about three hundred Magic Stone Points, so I ended up getting approximately a thousand five hundred in total. I even managed to get my hands on Ice/Snow Magic, Lava Magic, and Moonlight Magic as a bit of an added bonus.</p>
<p>Man, that went so well. felt like I was working some sort of super well paying job or something like that.</p>
<p>Gaining all those magic stone points did wonders for my self evolution skill. Things were looking up.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Self Evolution: Rank 11.<br>
Magic Stone Points: 4486/6000<br>
Memory: 100<br>
Spendable Points: 2</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Each golem being three hundred points meant that they were worth roughly the same as B ranked magic beasts.</p>
<p>「Alright. That’s over with. We’d best move onto investigating the Alchemist’s Guild’s interior.」</p>
<p>「Good idea. Might still be something in there.」</p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>136. Zerais’ Ambition<br>
</b><br>
We immediately started investigating the Alchemist’s Guild after defeating the Magic Stone Soldiers that emerged from within it. I was honestly left blown aback by the fact that it was basically completely devoid of human life. In fact, the only living things we ever came across were the occasional mouse or roach.</p>
<p><span id="more-591"></span></p>
<p>It looked most of the alchemists had either been turned into Demonic Beings or killed in experiments' processes. This was further evidenced by the document Zerais had left in the facility’s basement. The observation logs there within described the results of administering different dosages and the like. Even a quick glance at the report's contents left me filled with a sense of disgust.</p>
<p>I’d been hoping for him to have left a few magic stones sitting around or something, but much to my disappointment, he hadn’t. There wasn’t really anything of interest, least not for us, so we quickly grabbed all of Zerais’ data before turning heel. We planned to hand it over to Gamud or Eugene a bit later on.</p>
<p>『Hey Urushi, are there any like escape routes or hidden passages around here or anything?』</p>
<p>「Ruff.」</p>
<p>『Oh well, too bad…』</p>
<p>「Might I ask how things are progressing on your end, Fran?」</p>
<p>Eugene called out to us and requested a quick update.</p>
<p>「Got documents.」</p>
<p>「I see. The same goes for myself.」</p>
<p>The Adventurer’s Guild’s alchemist continued to look around with a grim look on his face. My guess was that he was probably feeling the weight of his disciple’s sins.</p>
<p>「Can use them to figure something out?」</p>
<p>「To an extent. However, I do believe that it’s possible for Zerais to have intentionally left these documents behind as they’d provide only a miniscule amount of knowledge.」</p>
<p>「Intentionally?」</p>
<p>「Precisely. None of the documents I came across contained any sort of key information regarding his processes. Hence, they leaves me unable to reproduce the results he’s managed to derive. The only useful information his files contain are pertinent to the conclusions drawn. There’s also just enough data left in order to evidence his conclusions’ validity.」</p>
<p>Ahhh, I get it now. Zerais wanted his name to be known across the land. Hence, his personality probably led him to leave just enough data behind to show off his efforts.</p>
<p>「This document on Magic Stone Soldiers is a prime example of what I mean to say. It states that employing the use of evil energies can allow one to engrave a single spell upon the magic stone that serves as the soldier’s core. It makes no further mention of the processes involved and hence does not provide one with enough information to recreate his work. That said though, the information presented is not required for his documents to prove his point, seeing as how the end result, the Magic Stone Soldiers, had only recently engaged us in combat.」</p>
<p>Eugene quickly glanced at another one of the documents he grabbed, and found it to be rather similar. It described that different humans being would require magic stones imbedded in different locations, a fact that our experience with them had solidified. That, however, was basically all the document said. It didn’t tell us how to actually figure out where to put the magic stone, nor did it describe the embedding process.</p>
<p>「This?」</p>
<p>「That one… seems to describe a weapon constructed of magic stones… Hmm….」</p>
<p>Fran handed the document we found over and had Eugene quickly look over it. Apparently, it contained information about something that was kind of just a little bit dangerous.</p>
<p>The weapons described in the document were unlike the usual in the sense that they didn’t simply use the magic stones embedded in them as a source of fuel. Instead, they allowed the wielder to use the spells sealed inside of them. Moreover was the fact that they were expendable as opposed to long lasting. The most intimidating part of it all was that they could even store extra skills and unique skills, and hence, were hella useful even if only usable once.</p>
<p>「Zerais was… ever so talented. If only he could have used his abilities to better the world and the lives of its people…」</p>
<p>Eugene’s face was distorted with a look of lament.</p>
<p>「Magic stone weapon. Seems amazing.」</p>
<p>「I agree. It’s applicabilities are boundless.」</p>
<p>We suddenly felt a presence appear behind us immediately after Eugene finished speaking.</p>
<p>「Thief God’s Grace.」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>『Who the hell!?』</p>
<p>Seriously, what!? There hadn’t been anything there just a second ago.</p>
<p>Fran immediately reacted by swinging me to her rear, but she wasn’t the only one to act. The person behind her also started to give off an incredible amount of magical energy.</p>
<p>I immediately deployed my Magic Barrier at full power as Fran turned around and faced our foe.</p>
<p>The person that’d been standing behind us was none other than the guy whose looks pissed me off to no end.</p>
<p>Zerais.</p>
<p>How the hell? Wait, I recalled him saying “Thief God’s Grace,” so he’d probably used a skill. Its name gave way to the fact that it was most likely derived from being the recipient of Divine Protection.</p>
<p>「Ooookay. I’ll be taking this back now, thanks.」</p>
<p>Zerais was smiling a prince-like smile despite the fact that I’d chopped off one of his arms. He raised his remaining hand and dangled a bottle as if to show it off to Fran.</p>
<p>「Mmph. How?」</p>
<p>『What? That’s impossible! That should’ve been inside my dimensional storage!』</p>
<p>The thing Zerais was holding was the bottle that contained the Root of Arcane Souls.</p>
<p>「Fmmph!」</p>
<p>「Ahahahha, oh come on, no need for you to be looking at me like that.」</p>
<p>「Mmph, can’t cut.」</p>
<p>「That would be because he’s already turned into an illusion.」</p>
<p>「Woah, that was close. I probably would’ve been split in half if I teleported even just a moment later.」</p>
<p>I ended up passing through nothing but thin air. Zerais himself had already disappeared. He’d instead been replaced by a hologram without any physical substance identical to the one we saw in front of the guild.</p>
<p>「Seriously though, just who are you? You came out of nowhere, completely messed up my plans, and even managed to completely obliterate all my Magic Stone Soldiers with ease. You know how frustrated all that’s been making me? I mean, I may not look it, but I sure am.」</p>
<p>「Just black cat clan, D ranked adventurer. Fran.」</p>
<p>「Ahahaha! Nice one, nice one. You know I made it so that those magic stone soldiers were supposed to have the evil energies inside of them swell up and explode if you hit them the wrong way, right? There’s no way for a D ranked adventurer to be able to completely wipe out all that evil energy in an instant, you know?」</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Did anyway.」</p>
<p>「I started following you around the moment you started fighting them so I could steal this little thing back from you, but you defeated them right away and didn’t show even the slightest opening. Course, I followed you after too, but you still never showed any openings at all no matter what. I ended up having to trade you one of my arms for it, but I did manage to get what I needed, so it’s fine I guess.」</p>
<p>「Took, how?」</p>
<p>「Oh you know, I decided to use a Magic Stone Weapon. It let me use the Thief God’s Grace, which is a skill that’ll let you steal anything from anyone so long as they’re within the skill’s area of effect. All the data I’ve got on you seemed to be pointing to the fact that you could use space/time magic, so I assumed you had a dimensional storage. Man, you know, I really would’ve had to give up if I didn’t have the Thief God’s Grace with me. Oh yeah, and the reason I could follow you without you noticing me is cause I was using a Magic Stone Weapon with the Perfect Invisibility skill sealed inside of it, yup.」</p>
<p>The pendant that’d been resting on top of Zerais’ severed arm cracked and shattered into several pieces. So that’s a Magic Stone Weapon? Okay yeah, it’s just as I suspected. Those things are ridiculous as hell, even if limited to being one time use.</p>
<p>「Aw man, now it and the one with the Thief God’s Grace are both all busted up. They cost a hundred million gold in total, you know? They were supposed to be my trump cards.」</p>
<p>「Wanted item that badly?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I guess you could say that. You know, I actually really want to thank you. I probably never would’ve been able to get my hands on it if you hadn’t taken it from those god damned pirates. Man, I went through soooo much trouble for all this stuff. Thank you so much! I won’t have to write off any of my plans anymore after all.」</p>
<p>「And just what precisely is that supposed to be, Zerais?」</p>
<p>Eugene finally joined in on the conversation after staying silent throughout. It seemed that he was genuinely curious as to the identity the soul contained within the bottle.</p>
<p>「Oh man, not even you knew, Master? Hehehe, it’s a Chimera’s Arcane Soul. Surprised? I bet you are.」</p>
<p>「T-That’s preposterous. D-Did you just say a Chimera?」</p>
<p>「Rare?」</p>
<p>「The word rare doesn’t even begin to describe it. There are rumoured to be less than five Chimeras throughout the world. They’re so dangerous that they’re all supposed to have been sealed away.」</p>
<p>「Ahahaha! See, I knew you’d be surprised. Isn't this thing just great? I requested it from the Reidosian Alchemy Lab by using the Barbra Guild’s name and all that. It ended up costing me a whole billion! Man, you know much money a billion is? Actually, it wasn’t even my money, so I don’t really care. But man, it was one hell of a snag!」</p>
<p>「Just what are you trying to accomplish?」</p>
<p>「Oh you know, I’m just going to be making the strongest magic beast ever. The final product should hopefully be strong enough to destroy the entire world!」</p>
<p>Holy crap. That item was way more than I'd thought it was.</p>
<p>「Anyway, I’ve met all my goals, so I’ll actually be bidding you farewell for real this time. Buh bye!」</p>
<p>「Wait, hold on! Zerais!」</p>
<p>Eugene yelled his disciple’s name at the top of his lungs, but the other man was long gone.</p>
<p>「Zerais…」</p>
<p>「Chimera is what?」</p>
<p>「Ah, right. Chimeras are the most powerful artificial magic beasts known to man.」</p>
<p>Apparently, they were something made in an experiment involving mixing many different kinds of magic beasts together.</p>
<p>Chimeras were considered biological weapons ranked A or higher. The researchers that made the first hadn’t expected it to be as powerful as it was, and thus, they ended up losing control of it. The escaped subject had ultimately ended up completely ravaging several cities.</p>
<p>The researchers continued to churn them out in while also attempting to actually take control of them, but it turned out to be an impossible task. Several countries ultimately ended up falling to the experiment’s products, and thus, all the world’s governments ended up coming to conclusion that further research on the topic should be banned, and that all existing Chimeras should be sealed away. The researchers’ data was destroyed, and they themselves executed.</p>
<p>Creating a Chimera took ridiculously pricey materials, some of which came from creatures that had long gone extinct. It should’ve theoretically been impossible for anyone to get their hands on a Chimera given the current circumstances, but apparently it seemed that wasn’t the case…</p>
<p>「As of right now, the Kingdom of Reidos is a mess. Someone may have used the country's state of turmoil in order to steal the Chimera whilst not knowing the danger posed by their actions.」</p>
<p>「A mess?」</p>
<p>That’s the first time I’ve heard that. Then again, I didn't really know much about Reidosians. The only thing I did know was that I'd already started thinking of all Reidosians as my enemies.</p>
<p>「The Reidosian King died a sudden death approximately ten years ago. Four of the country’s archdukes have been wrestling for control through military means ever since. The country has almost fallen into one in a state of civil war. I’m honestly quite surprised to say that it hasn’t.」</p>
<p>「Understood.」</p>
<p>Hmmm, could that mean that Salrut and the Lich were both products of one of those archduke’s ploys? Or were they potentially products of them all scheming against one another? I wanted more information, but it seemed that Eugene had already told us everything he knew.</p>
<p>「I’m going to go report everything that has happened to both the Lord and the Adventurer’s Guild. Any matter involving a Chimera is of utmost importance, after all.」</p>
<p>It seemed like Zerais was going to have his name plastered on wanted posters all around the world. Chances were that he was probably actually going to be pretty happy about that, but it couldn’t really be helped. I agreed that dealing with him was indeed a matter of utmost importance.</p>
<p>We couldn’t find any additional clues, so we decided to give up and regroup with Amanda for the time being.</p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>137. The Contest’s Whereabouts</b></p>
<p>「And here’s your order.」</p>
<p>「Be careful, it’s hot!」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p><span id="more-597"></span></p>
<p>Today was the day after the incident. Err, technically, it was still the same day seeing as how everything happened after midnight, but yeah, whatever.</p>
<p>We were going around with our stall and handing away our products away for free, well, kind of. Barbra’s lord had technically bought us out in advance, so we were still making bank.</p>
<p>Zerais had gotten away, but naturally, the city’s problems hadn’t upped and vanished with him. We ended up having to go around hunting Evil and Demonic Beings all night. I think we managed to get around ten or so ourselves. The most successful hunter had been Forrund, who had netted himself a whole twenty kills. Our efforts had allowed the city had regain its usual tranquility by sunrise.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the population had taken a pretty big hit. Lots of people died. Those that had survived were left in a state of confusion result of last night's events. Thus, the cooking contest had naturally been cancelled. The Chef's Guild needed to sort itself out and identify all its corrupt members and whatnot before proceeding with its festivities.</p>
<p>That said, a complete and utter shut down would likely lead Brabra's citizens to feel uneasy about the city's state of affairs. The lord had wanted to prevent the city from adopting a negative atmosphere, and so, he had asked the contests’ participants to push their stalls around town and give out their products for free.</p>
<p>We didn’t really mind going along with his request. We had a tonne of curry bread left lying around, and apparently we were going to get cash out of helping out, so why not, right? It seemed that most of the other contestants had felt the same, as they’d also willingly assented.</p>
<p>「Hey! No fighting over there! We still have lots in stock, so calm yourselves down!」</p>
<p>「Would anyone like to try the dish that might just have ended up winning the contest? If so, then line yourselves right up!」</p>
<p>『Alright, why don’t we try moving along and heading over to the next area?』</p>
<p>The three girls we hired were helping us move the stall around. I’d originally been planning to have Urushi do it, but the lord had ended up advising otherwise. He told us that Urushi would end up scaring the citizens because of how large, fearsome, and potentially unsanitary he looked.</p>
<p>Hey! Urushi has feelings too, you know? He’s totally feeling down cause of all that.</p>
<p>Our second idea was to have Fran do it, but the three salesgirls had stated that they, as adults, couldn’t stand to let a child do physical labour in their presence while they did nothing. Hence, they ended up doing it instead despite being much weaker than her.</p>
<p>『The lord told us to visit as many places as we could, so, yeah.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Phillip had told us a few things before we ended up setting out. According to him, this whole free food thing was apparently the Krysten family giving back to the citizens what it could before it was deprived the ability. Most of their wealth was probably going to end up being confiscated, and hence, they were spending as much of it on helping Barbra’s people before it was all taken away. Apparently, they were more or less guaranteed to at least be relieved of their positions. The merits they’d accumulated over the last three hundred years were significant, but they weren’t enough to make up for an incident as big as the one that’d occured last night.</p>
<p>They’d sent a magistrate to the capital, and ordered him to report everything that had occured. Hence, they were expecting the King to get in touch with them within a few days. I honestly had to say that both the Lord and Phillip, his eldest son, were good people. They were honest, and upright. Their only faults were that they were a bit too soft on those they held dear.</p>
<p>He’d also told us about the fates that befell those that a hand in the crime. Apparently, everyone that Bluke had hired would end up being beheaded. The people that had been forced into cooperating would be made into crime slaves and sent off to Goldishia or the mines. Both locations involved them serving fixed terms.</p>
<p>I understood the whole mine thing, but I had no idea what he meant by Goldishia, so naturally, I had Fran ask him a bit about it.</p>
<p>Apparently, it was the name of the continent destroyed by Trismegistus. It was covered by a large barrier, but not actually completely sealed off. The barrier only covered the continent’s center. There were still a few places outside of it that could sustain human life.</p>
<p>The people who still lived on the Goldishian continent were mostly Dragonfolk. They were aware of the sins shouldered by their predecessors, and thus, they spent their days repenting by entering the great barrier and fighting the Abyss Eater. It seemed that the barrier had been made so that people could enter and leave it at will. The Abyss Eater, however, was unable to escape it.</p>
<p>The Dragonfolk had the world behind them. Every single nation offered them support in the form of both soldiers and supplies. Crime slaves were often sent over as well so that they could be put to use in the form of meat shields.</p>
<p>Wait, wouldn’t the death penalty actually just be better at that point?</p>
<p>It turned out that the answer to my question was no. Some crime slaves would actually manage to endure Goldishia’s harsh conditions, survive, level up, and attain freedom. Hence, it was still technically better than just flat out getting executed.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, some of the cooking guild’s top brass had ended up getting turned into crime slaves. They’d been judged to be at fault for not properly appraising Waint’s cooking. Bluke had been threatening them, so it wasn’t entirely fault, but they could’ve prevented an incredible amount of damage had they chosen to do their jobs properly.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>『You think this city’s still going to be alright from here on out? The Alchemist’s Guild is gone, the Lord’s going to get forced to retire, and a good chunk of the population’s just flat out dead. 』</p>
<p>「Worried about orphanage.」</p>
<p>『I think they’ll be fine. Amanda’s got their backs.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Right. Amanda, not type of person to let children be sad.」</p>
<p>『Honestly, I’m more worried about the Chef’s Guild than the orphanage. It looks like they might end up completely collapsing at this rate.』</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>Fran’s eyes suddenly shot open in response to my words.</p>
<p>『Hey uh, you alright? Is something wrong?』</p>
<p>「No finals if no contest…」</p>
<p>『Well, yeah.』</p>
<p>「Can’t force feed him curry!」</p>
<p>『Ahh, you mean that one old due? Yeah.』</p>
<p>「Managed to escape!」</p>
<p>『Well uh, it’s technically not his fault, so escape might not really be the right word.』</p>
<p>Yeaaaah, I totally forgot about him. I wonder if he’s doing alright. I mean, I thought he was a pretty good guy, so I hope he didn’t end up getting caught in this whole mess.</p>
<p>Wait, did we just end up raising a flag or something? He literally showed up right in front of the stall as we finished moving it and started setting it up again. His face was coated with its usual frown. I couldn’t immediately tell what he was up to, but soon realized that he was waiting for us to finish our preparations. The way he stared at us almost made it seem like he was trying to tell us to hurry the hell up.</p>
<p>「Mmph.」</p>
<p>「I’ve come to try your dish.」</p>
<p>「Will make you break down into tears.」</p>
<p>「I’m looking forward to it.」</p>
<p>The man’s frown broke into a fearless smile.</p>
<p>Judith seemed to be taken aback by the sudden event. Lydia, on the other hand, appeared to have caught on, as her eyes were sparkling with a weird sense of anticipation. I couldn’t really tell what Maia was feeling at all. Maia was typically all smiles, but interestingly enough, she was actually the hardest of the bunch to read. She completely trumped the not-actually-emotionless Lydia.</p>
<p>The old man took his first bite out of a piece of plain curry bread approximately ten minutes later. His location hadn’t really changed much, he was still standing right beside the stall.</p>
<p>「Oh?」</p>
<p>Damn, I’m starting to get all nervous. I was pretty confident in the dish’s taste seeing as I’d tried it myself and all, but, I was no gourmet. I had no idea as to how he’d feel about it.</p>
<p>「Hmm.」</p>
<p>「Well?」</p>
<p>「I very much regret the fact that I’m unable to stuff myself with as much of this as I’d like.」</p>
<p>Wait, does that mean he liked it?</p>
<p>「The fried breading provides an excellent sense of texture, thereby deepening the dish’s taste and pushing it over the edge. The filling is obviously the very same curry that you had me consume upon our last meeting, but I can taste that its recipe has been slightly adjusted for it better fit with bread that encloses it. As a result, the sauce and its container serve to amplify each other’s tastes and deliver a final product far beyond the sum of its ingredients. It would not be an exaggeration to say that this very recipe has earned its right as one that functions as a milestone in cooking’s history. Please do tell your master that I found it to be a wonderful dish with a unique, thorough flavour.」</p>
<p>He totally just gave the type of speech you’d normally see in a food journal! Shit, he totally praised the hell out of me!</p>
<p>「Nn. Will tell.」</p>
<p>「I’d also like to say that I’m sorry that the contest ended up the way it did.」</p>
<p>「Nn? Not guild’s fault.」</p>
<p>「Even so, I’d like to apologize regardless. Many of our members were responsible for the incident. I’m absolutely certain that your dish would’ve allowed you to make it to the finals.」</p>
<p>Huh, this old guy’s actually pretty honourable. It looked like he visited us for the sole sake of fulfilling his promise.</p>
<p>「I’d like to retract my words. Your master is a wonderful cook, and this dish of his is absolutely delicious.」</p>
<p>「Heheh」</p>
<p>Come on Fran, this is where you’re supposed to say “”Don’t worry about it,”” instead of getting all cocky you know? Well, the old guy didn’t really seem to mind, so it’s fine I guess.</p>
<p>Man, I’m tired. I feel like taking a nice, long break after we’re done giving out all this curry bread. Man, worrying about pickpockets, taking curry bread out from my dimensional storage, and all that other random stuff I did sure was exhausting. I know what you're thinking, but I swear I am actually tired, okay?</p>
<p>Wait, where’d all these people come from? Why the hell is the line so long?</p>
<p>I guess that old dude must've been a local celebrity or something. Everyone in line immediately started talking about how he praised us.</p>
<p>「Huuuh? How’d the line suddenly get this much longer?」</p>
<p>「There’s way too many people here.」</p>
<p>「I guess they must all be attracted to my beauty.」</p>
<p>Welp, looks like I’m not getting that break any time soon.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>TL: Sorry for the slow updates… Exams will be over soon!</p>

</b></p>
<p>「I would like to offer you my thanks in return for your assistance.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Phillip stopped by not too long after we finished handing out curry bread and whatnot. It was a bit late, so Urushi had actually long passed out inside of Fran’s shadow. That said though, we decided to let the knight in anyways in anyways seeing as how he came out of his way to visit us and all that.</p>
<p><span id="more-604"></span></p>
<p>At first, I'd been a bit surprised to see that he was unguarded, but quickly rationalized it. Phillip was incredibly strong, so to him, guards were more of a luxury than necessity. It was only natural for him to come alone given how short the city currently was on manpower.</p>
<p>The first thing he did after arriving was hand Fran a box whose sides measured about thirty centimeters each. The wooden container was black, but not unnaturally so. It seemed to be made out of ebony.</p>
<p>「This is your reward. We would have hosted a grand ceremony in recognition of your efforts, but our current circumstances unfortunately do not allow for it.」</p>
<p>「Don’t mind. Don’t want to stand out anyways.」</p>
<p>「I am glad you that is how you feel about the matter. The magistrate stated that he would like for us to minimize any and all publicity related to last night’s incident.」</p>
<p>A scandal involving a marquis was pretty much as big a thing as a scandal involving the entire nation served by said marquis, so chances were, the country wanted to make this whole fiasco seem as small scale as possible.</p>
<p>In fact, they were so keen on restricting knowledge on the event’s details that they weren’t even actually going to announce that the Krystens were actually responsible for the incident. Or rather, they couldn't.</p>
<p>The lord's household had heavily involved themselves in cleaning up after last night's events. They had not only kept crime at a minimum in the disaster's aftermath but also generously compensated Barbra's people for their losses. Announcing that they were at fault for the incident would result in a loss of trust, and thereby cause the current state of affairs to degenerate into a downwards spiral. That, in the country’s eyes, was a scenario they wished to avoid at all cost. In other words, the country had decided not to punish the Krystens. Instead, it tasked them with restoring Barbra to its former glory.</p>
<p>「My father and I had planned to make our sins public knowledge, but we as nobles cannot go against the court’s wishes. It is unfortunate, but we cannot announce my brothers’ sins either.」</p>
<p>「To Bluke. What happened?」</p>
<p>「Neither Bluke nor Waint are longer human. They have both lost the ability to reason, and thus, we’ve no choice but to put them to death. We have yet to determine the precise method of execution, but I have no doubt that they will soon pay for their sins. As we cannot inform the citizens of our wrongdoings, we will announce their official cause of death to be illness.」</p>
<p>Yeah, I figured something like that'd happen.</p>
<p>Phillip’s expression turned a bit sour as he discussed Waint and Bluke. He seemed troubled. My guess was that he still loved both his brothers despite their actions and current states.</p>
<p>「I apologize, but we cannot publicly credit you for Bluke’s arrest.」</p>
<p>「Don’t really mind.」</p>
<p>I mean, we got rewarded anyways, so who cares?</p>
<p>Phillip seemed really apologetic about the lack of credit we'd get throughout his visit, but we honestly would’ve rejected any ceremonies or parades or anything like that anyways. In fact, we very much preferred him doing things the way he did.</p>
<p>「Master. Will open now.」</p>
<p>『Go for it. I’m pretty curious about what they gave us.』</p>
<p>Fran opened her reward shortly after Phillip’s departure, only to find it full of valuables.</p>
<p>The first thing to catch my eye was a stack of gold coins that added up to a whole million Golde in total. The rest of the box was pretty much filled to the brim with jewelry. We’d gone into this whole thing thinking we’d be working for free, so we were pretty damn happy about getting rewarded, especially with so much cash.</p>
<p>『Coming to Barbra sure has made us a lot of bank.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Can buy lots.」</p>
<p>『Yeah. Were you thinking of buying anything in particular? Like food or something?』</p>
<p>「Want that too. But not what was in mind.」</p>
<p>Wait, Fran wants something other than food? That’s rare. Is she finally going to buy herself something all cute and girly-like? Or maybe some fancy clothing?</p>
<p>Okay, yeah no.</p>
<p>「Will buy magic stones.」</p>
<p>『Huh? Magic stones?』</p>
<p>「Nn. Will buy magic stones for Master to absorb. Aiming for rank up. Barbra should have lots.」</p>
<p>『You sure?』</p>
<p>The thought of buying magic stones for the sake of absorption was something that weighed on my conscience. It just kinda felt like all the money we made belonged to Fran. The same went with potions, armour, materials, and all that stuff too. She’d take all that, while I’d take the magic stones. That was just how I had it sorted out in my head.</p>
<p>Though, I did understand that me getting stronger was equivalent to her getting stronger, so it wasn’t exactly like I was actually depriving her of funds for no benefit or anything like that.</p>
<p>Besides, I did figure that this would end up happening in due time anyways.</p>
<p>In fact, I’d always thought that we would probably end up having to become a rather aggressive buyer of magic stones. Each consecutive rank up required more magic stones than the last. Powering me up was ultimately going to end up getting a lot harder down the line.</p>
<p>「Will sell all unneeded items, buy needed items, then spend rest on magic stones.」</p>
<p>『I guess that works. We’d probably be able to get a pretty big variety if we asked both the Adventurer’s Guild and the Luciel Conglomerate.』</p>
<p>Ideally, I’d prefer if we could get our hands on magic stones from either higher ranked monsters or monsters whose magic stones we’d yet to obtain.</p>
<p>Welp, I guess it’s time to sell all the stuff we don’t need that’s piled up in storage.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>「Thanks for waiting. Here’s what we owe you, we’ll be bringing the merchandise you requested out shortly.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We dropped by the Luciel Conglomerate in order to get rid of all the junk we still had on hand. We sold off all our weaker equips, our spare magic items, and even all the randomly jewelry we happened to have on hand. We’d actually just finished doing something similar at the adventurer’s guild as well. There, we sold off all the random magic beast parts we weren’t planning on using. We actually had quite a bit piled up in storage, so yeah.</p>
<p>Of course, we had bought all the stuff we needed as well. Our inventory ended up looking like this:</p>
<p>Phantom Pyroxene (Magic Sword)<br>
Deathgaze (Magic Sword)<br>
Mysterious Item Bag<br>
Highest Grade Life Potion x 3<br>
High Grade Life Potion x 5<br>
Panacea x 3<br>
High Grade Mana Potion x 3<br>
Mid Grade Mana Potion x 5<br>
Highest Grade Alchemy Potion x 3<br>
High Grade Potion of Repair x 1<br>
Potion of Rising Skill x 1<br>
Anti-Side Effect Potion x 3<br>
Lots of Ingredients<br>
Camping Supplies<br>
Corpses<br>
Poisoned Water</p>

        </div>
        
<p>We weren’t actually all that sure as to whether or not to the Aidoneus’ Mantle or the Serpent King’s Short Sword, but we ended up deciding to get rid of them.</p>
<p>Whew, emptying out our inventory made me feel all refreshed.</p>
<p>The two equips we bought were the Bracelet of Herculean Strength and the Mage’s Necklace. The former increase the STR stat by twenty, and the latter provided a bit of a boost to magic. Fran’s current equips were:</p>
<p>Black Cat Set<br>
Bracelet of Herculean Strength<br>
Bracelet of Substitution<br>
Mage’s Necklace</p>
<p>We ended up having about four and a half million Golde on hand even after buying two new equips.</p>
<p>That said though, my sense of value is getting really screwy. I actually ended up thinking that the bracelet we bought was rather cheap despite it costing a million and two hundred thousand.</p>
<p>『I guess we’ll be spending the rest on magic stones.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「So about those magic stones you wanted…」</p>
<p>Hmm, Captain Rengil’s all hesitating and stuff. Looks like they probably won’t be willing to sell us any.</p>
<p>「Barbra’s currently experiencing a major shortage of magic stones.」</p>
<p>「Why?」</p>
<p>「The Alchemist’s Guild was buying them all up. We’ve very few D ranked stones, even.」</p>
<p>「Still have some?」</p>
<p>「A few, but they all belong to either Gullinburstis or Apis, and I recall you saying that you had no interest in either.」</p>
<p>So they basically only have stuff you can get locally?</p>
<p>「The supply shortage has caused the price to skyrocket too. They’re going for nearly twice as much as usual right now.」</p>
<p>God damn it Zerais! You son of a bitch! Fuck, you owe us way more than just one arm. Curse you, asshole!</p>
<p>（What now?）</p>
<p>『Uhhh, well, there isn’t really anything to do.』</p>
<p>The Adventurer’s Guild had a policy against selling magic stones to anything but other organisations. The only place in Barbra we could actually try was really just the Luciel Conglomerate. So uh, yeah. We were pretty much dead out of luck.</p>
<p>「The only other magic stones we happen to have in stock are scrap stones.」</p>
<p>「Scrap stones?」</p>
<p>「The term refers to magic stones that come from Goblins, Fanged Mice, and other magic beasts ranked at G or lower.」</p>
<p>「Have those in stock?」</p>
<p>「We do. The magic stone shortage has actually lasted for quite some time, so we bought them in order to experiment with them, but we couldn’t find any use for them, so they’ve more or less just been sitting there.」</p>
<p>（Master?）</p>
<p>『Sounds good to me.』</p>
<p>Goblins had all sorts of skills, so I didn’t see any harm in going through with the purchase.</p>
<p>We ended up buying a total of two hundred scrap stones, alongside fifteen slightly better stones that I hadn’t absorbed before. We had no idea what skills they contained, but honestly, it didn’t really matter. They were worth their weight in magic stone points anyways.</p>
<p>「You sure you want these? They’re scrap stones, you know?」</p>
<p>「Don’t mind.」</p>
<p>「Alright then. I’m honestly thankful you’re taking these off my hands, so I’ll throw in a bit of a bonus.」</p>
<p>We ended up a total of a hundred thousand Golde on magic stones. Apparently, their prices didn’t really start skyrocketing till they hit rank D. Magic stones of rank E or lower were typically used for everyday commodities and stuff, so they were still rather cheap. Even the most expensive magic stone, one that came from an Ice Rock Apis, only ended up costing us three thousand Golde.</p>
<p>I immediately started absorbing them after we got back to the inn.</p>
<p>「Master. Ready.」</p>
<p>『Oh hell yeah! Hnnnnnnnngggg!!』</p>
<p>I had Fran pour all the magic stones she got into an empty bathtub and dived straight in the moment it was ready.</p>
<p>So you might be wondering to yourself, what the hell is that damn sword doing?</p>
<p>Well you see, the answer is… taking a magic stone bath. You know how like, people that suddenly got super rich would start bathing in their cash? Yeah, this is that, but with magic stones instead of dollar bills.</p>
<p>Hot damn! I’m completely immersed in magic stones. This. Is. Bliss.</p>
<p>「Master, having fun?」</p>
<p>『Hell yeah I am! Yahooooo!!!』</p>
<p>Absorbing magic stones one at a time would’ve ended up being a huge pain in the ass, so I ended up coming up with this method for the sake of efficiency.</p>
<p>Fuck, this is amazing! I feel filthy fucking rich! This is what it’s like to be loaded! Shit, I’m feeling like some snobby ass douche right now, but who cares!!”</p>
<p>『Yeaaaaa boiiiiii!!!』</p>
<p>Even the slightest bit of movement causes me to absorb the magic stones around me. I can feel their power flowing into me. Hnnnngg!</p>
<p>And so, ten minutes passed.</p>
<p>「Master…」</p>
<p>「Woof…」</p>
<p>『Mah bad…』</p>
<p>I realized only after the fact that I’d done something unbecoming. I was supposed to be Fran’s guardian, so acting like that wasn’t exactly the best idea. Man, Damn it, now their gazes have gone cold. They’re both looking at me like I’m some weirdo. Stop it Fran, Urushi! Your eyes burn!!</p>
<p>『Y-You guys want anything? Feel free not to hold back.』</p>
<p>「…All you can eat curry. 1 week.」</p>
<p>「Woof」</p>
<p>『S-Sure why not.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Alright, I’m going to need to be a responsible adult. Time to get my dignity as a guardian back.</p>
<p>『I-I ended up getting about seven hundred magic stone points.』</p>
<p>「Decent amount.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>My stats had changed as follows.</p>
<p><b>Self Evolution</b><br>
Rank 11<br>
Magic Stone Points: 5169/6600<br>
Memory: 100<br>
Spendable Points: 2</p>
<p><b>New Skills</b><br>
Detect Malice: Lv 1<br>
Evil Sword Techniques: Lv 1<br>
Illusion Magic: Lv 1<br>
Thin Sword Techniques: Lv 1<br>
Thin Sword Arts: Lv 1<br>
Staff Techniques: Lv 1</p>
<p>Okay yup, it’s not working. Their gazes are still all chilly.</p>
<p>『S-So, how about paying the Prince and Princess a quick visit before we set off for Ulmutt?』</p>
<p>「Agreed,」</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s go!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Whew, I think they're both back to normal now.</p>
<p>The two turned around the moment the thought crossed my mind. Both Fran and Urushi tilted their heads and looked up at me, their actions in perfect sync. It almost looked like they’d planned it out ahead of time.</p>
<p>「No forgetting about all you can eat curry.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof.」</p>
<p>『Yes ma’am.』</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>I was actually planning to do this yesterday, but I played like 30 minutes of the Xenoblade game for the Switch, and was so disgusted by the localization that I couldn’t bring myself to read the English language for an entire day. Seeing English still makes me cringe right now, in fact…</p>
<p>On a side note, after this chapter, I'm going to start making master use stuff like "100k" for numbers. Iunno why I forgot until just now. Maybe I haven't been playing enough (any) MMOs as of late. The reason I didn't do it in this chapter is because I remembered after finishing and I'm too lazy to go back and change stuff.</p>

		<p><b>139. Next Next Destination.<br>
</b></p>
<p>「Is that really what happened?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「That’s quite amazing, Fran.」</p>
<p>We were currently inside of Rhodas’ manor.</p>
<p><span id="more-609"></span></p>
<p>That said, we naturally weren't actually visiting him. We'd come to see the prince and princess.</p>
<p>It turned out that we weren’t the only ones getting ready to leave the city. Flut and his party were also packing up and getting ready to head back to their country. Their ship was to set sail tomorrow.</p>
<p>「Did you see any of the monstrosities?」</p>
<p>「I did.」</p>
<p>「Did you fight them?」</p>
<p>「Defeated easily.」</p>
<p>「That’s awesome! Man, Fran, you’re so cool!」</p>
<p>Fran, the prince, the princess, and the former slaves had gotten together for a tea party.</p>
<p>The children were delighted at the fact that we’d provided them snacks in the form of curry bread.</p>
<p>「Are you not going to come with us, Fran?」</p>
<p>One of the former slave asked her in a bit of a hopeful tone, but she responded to him with a shake of her head.</p>
<p>「Already decided where to go.」</p>
<p>「Come on, can’t you just change your mind and join us in serving the prince?」</p>
<p>「Need to go.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, but we’ve finally started getting along…」</p>
<p>「Yeah, he’s right!」</p>
<p>「Let’s not pressure Fran any further. I’m sure she has her reasons and circumstances.」</p>
<p>「That’s right. Besides, it isn’t as if we won’t ever see each other again.」</p>
<p>Flut and Satia somehow managed to calm the other children down.</p>
<p>「I do understand how you all feel. I’d love for her to come with us as well. In fact, I’ve even considered offering to hire her as our guard once more. I’d also considered offering her a permanent, high paying position.」</p>
<p>「Then w-」</p>
<p>「But I decided against it. I’ve decided not to make use of royal position.」</p>
<p>One of the children tried to protest, but Flut quickly cut him off by raising his voice while shaking his head.</p>
<p>「Because I would then lose the ability to call her my friend.」</p>
<p>「We would much rather be Fran’s friends than her superiors. If we employed her, we’d no longer be able to call her our equal.」</p>
<p>The children fell silent in response to the prince and princess' proclamations. They seemed to have understood and accepted the twins' opinions.</p>
<p>Fran looked rather pleased to hear their choices. Her expression hadn’t changed, but both her ears were happily twitching away, so it was rather easy for me to read her.</p>
<p>However, the children seemed to have felt that they’d been scolded, and hence, an unpleasant atmosphere soon filled the room. Luckily though, Serid bailed us out of the situation by bringing in even a few sweet treats. He also helped perk everyone up by telling us about the recent failures experienced by the children during their training sessions.</p>
<p>The children's moods were soon restored, and hence, they ended up chatting the entire day away. The sun had started setting before we’d even realised it.</p>
<p>We wanted to stick around a bit longer, but Serid informed us that Flut and Satia unfortunately had other responsibilities to attend to.</p>
<p>「I apologize for interrupting your conversation, but it has come time for your appointment with the Magistrate, your Highnesses.」</p>
<p>「Is it really that time already?」</p>
<p>「We had so much fun that the day almost seemed to pass in the blink of an eye.」</p>
<p>Both twins promptly accepted their duties; neither Flut nor Satia had voiced that they wished the delay the appointment. I was amazed at how they were already able to immediately prioritize their royal obligations over their personal interests.</p>
<p>「It is unfortunate, but we have an meeting to attend. We must depart for it immediately.」</p>
<p>「We still have tea and sweets readily available, so please feel free to stay as long as you’d like, Fran.」</p>
<p>「I unfortunately have to object to that. There is in fact an envoy here for Miss Fran as well.」</p>
<p>「Envoy?」</p>
<p>「I named him an envoy, but the individual in question is in fact the Master of Barbra’s Adventurer’s Guild. He has just finished meeting with the Sir Rhodas and the Magistrate. Guildmaster Gamud immediately stated that he would like to meet with you upon hearing that you were currently at this residence.」</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

        </div>
        
<p>The Guildmaster? Did he need us for anything? I could’ve sworn we dropped by the guild already just earlier this morning, but oh well, might as well go see him I guess.</p>
<p>One of the manor’s servants led us over to another room upon confirming that we were willing to see the other party.</p>
<p>「There you are, Fran!」</p>
<p>There, we met with the Guildmaster, the buff ass dwarf that’d help us fight off Rynford.</p>
<p>「Sorry for you calling you out like that.」</p>
<p>「Don’t mind.」</p>
<p>「Heard that you’d be leaving soon. I wanted to meet with you at least once before you did, but I couldn’t really find the time for it because I’ve been busy with cleaning up after everything that’s happened. Caught wind of the fact that you happened to be visiting, so I urged them to lend me a room. Been wanting to thank you, you know? Your actions saved the city.」</p>
<p>Gamud got up off the sofa and bowed a deep bow.</p>
<p>「Didn’t really save. In fact, was saved. Almost lost against Rynford.」</p>
<p>「Forrund and Amanda are the only two that could’ve possibly beat that thing one on one, so don’t sweat it. What matters is that you bought us enough time to arrive. He probably would’ve spread mass destruction if you didn’t manage to stall him. That’s why, I’ll say it again. Thank you.」</p>
<p>「…Nn.」</p>
<p>「Gahahaha. All’s good so long as you know how grateful we feel.」</p>
<p>Fran’s expression warped into one that simultaneously expressed both happiness and frustration. If I had to say, it seemed like it was leaning a bit more towards the latter than the former though.</p>
<p>That said, I can't really blame her. I mean, we really did end up losing to Rynford. In fact, recalling our loss is making me feel all frustrated too.</p>
<p>「Nyways, let’s get down to business. I heard that you were looking for magic stones. That true?」</p>
<p>「Still looking.」</p>
<p>「I see… And you’re planning to head to Ulmutt next?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「It ain’t going to be too easy for you to get your hands on magic stones over there either, you know?」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>「Really. Think bout it this way. Barbra is Kranzel’s second biggest city. All the other nearby cities ship their excess magic stones over to us, so there being none in Barbra means that there ain’t any anywhere else either. Of course applies to Ulmutt too. The place really does produce a lot of the stuff, but most of it gets ported right over.」</p>
<p>Wait, seriously? Well, I guess that does kind of make sense. I mean, Barbra’s got a lot of adventurers, but there’s no way they can get enough magic stones to fuel the whole city all by themselves.</p>
<p>It looks like it really is going to be hard for us to get magic stones, even if we do go to Ulmutt.</p>
<p>Gamud produced a folded up piece of paper one of his chest pockets as we groaned in response to his words.</p>
<p>「So I’ll give you this.」</p>
<p>Is that… a letter?</p>
<p>「This’ll serve as a letter of introduction. It’ll get you into the auction held in the kingdom’s capital.」</p>
<p>「Auction?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. They hold a huge auction in the capital every June. It’s normally pretty hard to get yourself through the door, but show this to the staff at the capital’s guild branch and they’ll let you take part in both the buying and the selling. 」</p>
<p>「Sure it’s okay to take?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, don’t sweat it. Oh, and don’t be feeling like you’re obligated to participate or anything either. Just do whatever you want, it’s just an option now is all. I do think it’s a good idea though. Should be able to get a whole bunch of magic stones for cheap if you get lucky.」</p>
<p>Looks like we just got our hands on something amazing. The auction sounds like a pretty big event.</p>
<p>「Nn. Will thankfully accept.」</p>
<p>「No problem. Glad to be of service.」</p>
<p>Welp, I guess we're going then. For some odd reason, we ended up deciding where to go after leaving Ulmutt despite not yet having even set off for Ulmutt.</p>

		<p><b>140. The Night Before Our Departure</b></p>
<p><i>Author’s note: Someone suggested that it would be better to have Bluke and Waint listed as the incident's casualties as opposed to people who died from illness shortly after, so I’ll touch up on that a bit. </i><b><u>NOT A TRANSLATOR’S NOTE</u></b></p>
<p><span id="more-617"></span></p>
<p>We happened to spot someone standing in front of the inn as we made our way back towards it.</p>
<p>「Colbert?」</p>
<p>「Oh, there you are. Hey.」</p>
<p>「Doing what?」</p>
<p>「I happened to catch wind of the fact that you would soon be leaving the city, so I was thinking of maybe treating you to meal. I’ve got a fairly good restaurant in mind.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Looking forward to it.」</p>
<p>「Please do. I’ve invited the Scarlet Maidens as well. Let’s have ourselves a blast.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Sounds Good.」</p>
<p>「Right, there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask. How fares the master? Was he adversely affected by the incident? Did he happen to incur any sort of injury?」</p>
<p>「No problem. Already healed.」</p>
<p>All my injuries pretty much regenerated right way, so I was perfectly fine.</p>
<p>「W-w-w-what?! Is he really alright!? D-Did his injuries have any adverse after effects!? W-w-we need to get him a potion! As high quality a potion as possible!」</p>
<p>Colbert, apparently seemed to think it to be a big deal though, as he grabbed Fran by the shoulders and immediately started shouting. It was an action she probably would’ve hit him for had he not been one of her acquaintances.</p>
<p>「…Nn.」</p>
<p>But since he was, she instead ended up being completely taken aback by his sudden action, and only barely managed to squeeze out a reply.</p>
<p>Right, Colbert was one of my fans for some odd reason.</p>
<p>And, now that I think about it, he’s actually helped us out a tonne. He played a huge role in both fighting off magic beasts and helping us with the cooking contest. I’d like to thank him if possible… Hmmm…</p>
<p>（Master?）</p>
<p>『Tell him I’ll be joining you guys for two odd hours. I’m planning to tag along with a doppelganger.』</p>
<p>The only problem was that my doppelgangers would always spawn in wearing a t-shirt, a jersey, and a pair of sandals. That said, the aforementioned appearance only something that my doppelgangers had started adopting recently, mostly because I’d finally gotten used to the skill. In the past, I used to spawn in with Fran’s cloak, so chances were, the doppelgangers' appearances probably had to do with the skill level and my ability to picture stuff. I do recall the System Announcer spawning in all the clones she summoned with cool looking armour and whatnot, so I should be able to do all that too if I bump the skill level up a bit more.</p>
<p>But either way, I feel like I’d end up disappointing Colbert if I dressed like that. In fact, I kind of doubted that the store would even actually let me in. It’d probably do better for me to stick to the dress code. Wait, would wearing an overcoat work instead? Yeah, I'll probably go with that.</p>
<p>（Got it. Colbert be pleased.）</p>
<p>Colbert’s excitement shot through the roof the moment Fran conveyed my intentions to him.</p>
<p>「W-What!? The Master will finally make his advent, you say!?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Then I simply cannot settle for taking him to a dining hall in the city’s outskirts!」</p>
<p>「Okay to take me there though?」</p>
<p>「I’ve no choice but to use every single connection I have and reserve only the finest restaurant!」</p>
<p>「Doesn’t matter, as long as tasty.」</p>
<p>「I must seek an appropriate restaurant immediately… Wait, no… It would be extremely rude of me to take the world’s greatest chef to a mere restaurant… I must immediately hunt the prey to be used myself… I do recall there being rumours of a dragon nesting in the Cage of the Crystal Tree…」</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>The three girls approached as we tried to figure out how to calm him down.</p>
<p>「What’s the matter, Colbert?」</p>
<p>「That’s kinda creepy and gross…」</p>
<p>「The fact that I look up to him as an adventurer makes me kind of want to cry.」</p>
<p>It seemed that throwing them into the mix did the trick, as hearing them all criticize him brought Colbert back to his senses.</p>
<p>「Oh, hey. When did you ladies get here?」</p>
<p>「We’re more interested in what you were up to.」</p>
<p>「Gross.」</p>
<p>「Did something good happen?」</p>
<p>「Yeah! You see…」</p>
<p>Aw crap. Lydia’s question ended up sending Colbert back over the edge.</p>
<p>Luckily, the four girls did ultimately manage to drag him off to the place he’d initially booked.</p>
<p>And so, thirty minutes passed.</p>
<p>「Nom nom nom nom」</p>
<p>「Well? How is it? Good, right?」</p>
<p>「Mmphnom」</p>
<p>The food appeared incredibly delicious. Fran had shoved ten whole plates down her throat, and had yet to stop.</p>
<p>「Have you heard about the Alchemist’s Guild? It seems that they’re planning to send some staff over from the capital in order to reorganize Barbra’s branch.」</p>
<p>「They used to have priority in the purchase of magic stones, but apparently they’re going to be losing that now. In fact, they’re not going to have restrictions and purchase limits too.」</p>
<p>Yeah, I figured they wouldn’t completely get rid of the Alchemist's Guild. Barbra was a city in which a vast number of resources were made available. The benefit of having people do research here far outweighed any potential costs.</p>
<p>Besides, the newly placed restrictions should hopefully prevent an any similar incidents from ever happening again. Hopefully.</p>
<p>「I’ve also heard that both the lord’s second and third sons died as a result of the incident’s events.」</p>
<p>「Oh, the two idiots, right?」</p>
<p>「I assume they were killed by the monstrosities?」</p>
<p>Huh, I thought Phillip said that they were going to claim that they died from illness? Saying they died in the incident would probably bring pity to the household and kind of rally the people to give the Krysten family their support. Phillip didn’t seem all that willing to do anything like that, so I figure that they probably ended up getting ordered to lie or something.</p>
<p>「It seems like there’s been a lot of rumours flying around even though we the whole thing just happened last night.」</p>
<p>「Oh yeah, I heard a few people talking about how they were worried that this was a sign of the Evil God’s revival.」</p>
<p>「I’ve also heard rumours of how another country had been pulling the strings from behind the scenes.」</p>
<p>「There was even a group saying that a demon was responsible for killing all the monstrosities and saving the city.」</p>
<p>「Oh come on, that one’s just flat out impossible. Why would there even be a demon in the city to begin with?」</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「That’s kind of just how rumours are.」</p>
<p>The three Scarlet Maidens were trying to kick the conversation into gear through the use of rumours, but Fran was too busy eating to actually pay attention to them. They naturally noticed, but, didn’t really pay it much mind. Instead, they ultimately ended up just awkwardly laughing it off before joining her in gluttony.</p>
<p>And so, the rest of the night pretty much ended up becoming a fatfest.</p>
<p>「This place is fairly famous for its low prices and good food.」</p>
<p>「The meat they sell here is delicious too.」</p>
<p>「I could just keep eating this forever.」</p>
<p>「Oh damn it you three, at least hold back a bit!」</p>
<p>「Free food is always the most delicious food you can get.」</p>
<p>It really did look quite good. The atmosphere was all lively and stuff too, so I kinda wanted to join in. It was about time anyways.</p>
<p>『Fran, it’s time.』</p>
<p>「Getting master. Will be back soon.」</p>
<p>「Please allow me to join you! I simply have to greet him upon his arrival!」</p>
<p>That’s a bit troubling. I’d been planning on using Doppleganger Synthesis just outside the store.</p>
<p>（Teleport.）</p>
<p>『Yeah, I guess I don’t really have any other choice, do I?』</p>
<p>「Bit far away. Will need a minute.」</p>
<p>I teleported a bit away and made a doppelganger. Normally, Fran would be able to teleport us both back, but that didn’t seem to be working. It normally worked because I counted as a piece of equipment, but a humanized doppelganger was uh, kind of not a piece of equipment. Luckily, it didn’t actually really matter because my doppelganger could still use space/time magic anyways.</p>
<p>And so, we teleported back to the restaurant.</p>
<p>I was wearing a large overcoat on top of my jersey and t-shirt. I would’ve immediately been labeled as suspicious back in Japan, but whatever, it was what it was.</p>
<p>「Brought him.」</p>
<p>「Y-Yeah. So he’s…」</p>
<p>「Nice to meet you. I’m Fran’s master.」</p>
<p>「I-It-It’s very nice to meet you too! I’m Colbert, and a huge fan of your cooking. The food you made was exquisite, be it the curry, sushi, or dishes served during the competition. Please allow me to enroll as one of your disciples!」</p>
<p>「Sorry.」</p>
<p>「He was refused immediately!」</p>
<p>Errrr, I was not expecting him to ask that, especially not right off the bat. Crap, did that mess up the mood?</p>
<p>「Damn… I guess it can’t be helped seeing as how I’m not nearly as talented as Miss Fran over there is.」</p>
<p>Fortunately, he ended up randomly accepting his rejection, which honestly made me feel a bit unsettled. I’d been intending on thanking him, but I ended up doing something rude instead.</p>
<p>I quickly handed him something to make up for it. I'd been planning on giving it to him later as a form of thanks regardless, but the timing seemed to work out perfectly.</p>
<p>「I can’t make you one of my apprentices, but I can give you this.」</p>
<p>「This…? Wait! W-Wh-what!? You have to be kidding me! Is it really okay for me to have this!? Am I dreaming!?」</p>
<p>「What did you receive, Colbert?」</p>
<p>「Groooossss」</p>
<p>「Is that supposed to be like a treasure map or something?」</p>
<p>「Shut up Lydia, you’re being rude! A-Ahh, right, so as I was saying, thank you very much for giving me something of such value!」</p>
<p>The thing I gave him was my curry rice recipe. I’m glad he was that happy to receive it, really made it worth giving.</p>
<p>The Luciel Conglomerate had asked to buy the curry bread recipe back when we went looking for magic stones, so I figured it might be a good idea to hand copies my curry recipe over to everyone that had helped us.</p>
<p>Naturally, I knew that the conglomerate wouldn’t be all that happy about us giving the curry rice recipe away for free if they ended up buying the curry bread one, even if the two were technically different dishes. That said, we still did need money in order to buy magic stones. Hence, we ended up giving them several other recipes for cheap as well in order to appease them. As a result, they did ultimately end up agreeing to letting us give away the recipe for the curry’s roux.</p>
<p>The other people we’d been planning to give the recipe to were Io, the old guy at the Chef’s Guild, and the cook at the inn we were staying at.</p>
<p>I’d really love for it to end up developing into Barbra’s speciality or something like that. I’m really looking forward to seeing all the variations that’d spawn from the recipe.</p>
<p>But yeah, the party went by pretty smoothly. We somehow managed to calm Colbert down and enjoy ourselves.</p>
<p>It actually turned out to be the first party I actually was really a part of ever since reincarnating. I mean, I was totally okay with being a sword, but this wasn't bad at all either. I honestly really enjoyed the two hours I spent just doing whatever.</p>
<p>It looked like Fran had herself a pretty good night too. She’d actually ended up humming in the shower after getting back to the inn.</p>
<p>「Woof…」</p>
<p>『Here’s a super spicy hamburger. Eat it and cheer up a bit.』</p>
<p>「Woof…」</p>
<p>Urushi was really disappointed by the fact that he couldn’t join us, and hence, ended up missing out on a bunch of delicious food.</p>
<p>『Don’t worry, they’ll be more good stuff to eat in the future, so cheer up, okay?』</p>
<p>「Woof…」</p>
<p>And so, morning came.</p>
<p>The first thing we did was make our way to front Barbra’s gate with a clear blue sky up above us.</p>
<p>『Looks like a good day to set out on a journey.』</p>
<p>I quickly went over our plans in order to confirm them.</p>
<p>We were going to set off for Ulmutt; it’d take us about five days for us to get there.</p>
<p>We’d them dive into the city’s two dungeons and level up before finally taking part in the city’s martial arts competition. This pretty much went without saying, but our goal would be to win it.</p>
<p>『Ulmutt, huh? I’m really looking forward to it.』</p>
<p>「To dungeon diving.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『We’ve bought everything we needed to buy, learned everything we needed to learn, and even bid all our farewells to everyone that mattered.』</p>
<p>Amanda had cried in response to our departure. She wasn’t going to leave till the orphanage was back on its feet, but it seemed like she was planning to meet us in Ulmutt once it was.</p>
<p>『Hopefully we’ll have gotten a lot stronger by next time we meet her.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Will for sure.」</p>
<p>『Yup. Anyways, I think it’s about time for us to go.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>141. Ulmutt’s Entrance<br>
</b><br>
It took us four days to get from Barbra to Ulmutt.</p>
<p>Nothing really happened along the way. The only event worth mentioning was us stumbling across a goblin's nest containing 20 odd individuals, but cleaning that up took us less than half an hour, so it honestly was rather insignificant.</p>
<p><span id="more-630"></span></p>
<p>It turned out that Ulmutt was much smaller a city than I’d been expecting it to be. I mean, I knew for a fact that it’d be smaller than Barbra, but it turned out that it was actually way smaller than Alessa too. In fact, it was less than half Alessa's size.</p>
<p>That said though, it’d still left quite an impression on me even from the very moment I first caught sight of it. Our approach included Urushi carrying us on his back while running through the sky as usual, so I ended up getting a birds eye view of the city. Said view allowed me to fully understand just how weird Ulmutt’s layout really was.</p>
<p>Most of the weirdness stemmed from the two large constructions that had immediately grabbed my attention. The first was the massive wall that ran all around the city’s borders. It was just as tall as Barbra’s, but much wider. It honestly looked extremely out of place, and almost entirely unnecessary.</p>
<p>The second was the enormous cylindrical structure that almost seemed to loom over the city in its entirety. I mean, I totally could’ve rationalized it as a fortress meant for the sake of defense had it been located outside the city’s perimeter, but it wasn’t. Hence, I could only assume that it to be some sort of shelter or facility.</p>
<p>『Oh well, we’ll figure out what it is if we just head over or something later.』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>The only issue with said suggestion was that getting into the city seemed like a huge pain in the ass in and of itself.</p>
<p>There were around a thousand people lined up before Ulmutt’s gates. It seemed that the city's main entrance was being swarmed by adventurers, spectators, and merchants alike as a result of the upcoming martial arts tournament.</p>
<p>Honestly, I thought the crowd to be justified seeing how the tournament was known as one of the kingdom’s biggest events.</p>
<p>We got off Urushi’s back at a spot a bit away from the crowd before moving towards the line and joining it — only to find out that the line basically wasn’t moving at all.</p>
<p>I overheard the merchants standing in front of us saying that it was a difficult to be admitted into the city if it was your first time there unless you were an adventurer. Ulmutt contained two different dungeons, so they’d pretty much interrogate everyone that wished to enter about their intentions at the admissions gate.</p>
<p>Anyone that’s been admitted once would then be granted a pass that’d allow them to freely enter and exit the city over the course of the next half year. It also allowed use of the less crowded non-admissions entrances. The martial arts competition was an annual event, so people that came solely for its sake would end up having to sit through the line every single year.</p>
<p>The people that came every year more or less regarded lining up as an annual tradition. Some of the more aggressive merchants would even intentionally target those waiting in line through the sale of refreshments. Some of these refreshments had come in the form of booze; several groups of people had already sat themselves down in order to engage in drinking contests and the like.</p>
<p>Seeing these sights reminded me of comiket and the other conventions we had back in Japan. As a result, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the event would end up starting before we actually managed to get ourselves admitted. [1]</p>
<p>It seemed I wasn’t the only one that felt that way, as some of the other individuals in line appeared simply incapable of waiting any longer. Most of these individuals were commoners or adventurers like us who were visiting the city for the first time.</p>
<p>The most agitated group of all was composed specifically of adventurers with a less than refined appearance. They were getting into arguments here and there. There’d yet to be any violence, but I felt as if a brawl could break out at any given moment.</p>
<p>Goddammit. Do those idiots not realize that they’re just making this whole line move even more slowly than usual?</p>
<p>Our gazes turned cold as we continued to observe them while patiently awaiting our turn.</p>
<p>『Goblin.』</p>
<p>（Ogre.）</p>
<p>『Hmmn.. Dragon.』</p>
<p>（Kobald.）</p>
<p>『Uhhh one sec… Uhhhhhh, demon.』</p>
<p>（Chimera.）</p>
<p>『Hmmmm』</p>
<p>Fran and I were killing time by engaging ourselves in games that could be played anywhere at any time. Specifically, we were currently taking turns listing off monsters whilst trying to be the last one to be able to name one.</p>
<p>However, said game of ours was ultimately brought to an abrupt end. And annoyingly enough, not because it’d finally become our turn.</p>
<p>「Hey you, brat. Get over here.」</p>
<p>A bearded adventurer called us over in a cocky tone. I took a quick glance at his stats, only to find that they were abysmal. He was probably an E ranker at best.</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>「Oi! Listen to me, you goddamn brat!」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>「Bastard, think you’re tough shit for ignoring me, huh?」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>Fran didn’t respond to the adventurer at all, as she was too busy trying to think up a monster to name. The man’s face had rapidly reddened as a result.</p>
<p>（Hmmmm…）</p>
<p>『Hey Fran.』</p>
<p>（Nn? Master, giving up?）</p>
<p>『Nah, it’s just that there’s someone trying to get your attention.』</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>The adventurer immediately started yelling at Fran as if to intimidate her the moment she turned towards him.</p>
<p>「I was thinking of allowing you to poor me booze once we made our way over the wall, but there ain’t no forgiving you now, brat!」</p>
<p>「Shut up.」</p>
<p>「The fuck you say!? You trying mess with me!?」</p>
<p>Fran had flattened her ears and muttered under her breath because of how much of a pain in the ass the guy was being, but, that only seemed to fuel his rage further.</p>
<p>「I’ll be making you pay for this!」</p>
<p>The bearded man immediately threw a punch in our direction. Is he stupid? Like, look at how many witnesses there are. Wait, does he have the ability to shut everyone up or something? Could he perhaps be related to one of Ulmutt’s more influential figures?</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>I was a bit concerned about the man’s identity, but Fran honestly couldn’t care less.</p>
<p>She slipped right by his attack and smashed her own fist straight into his solar plexus. The onlookers had probably initially thought it to be a rather insignificant action. In fact, many seemed to suspect that that the man wouldn't suffered even the slightest bit of damage from the attack, but they were immediately proven wrong and forced to doubt their own eyes.</p>
<p>「Guah!」</p>
<p>The man flew five meters before finally landing back on the ground. The force of the impact had caused him to keep rolling even afterwards.</p>
<p>『Did you not hold back?』</p>
<p>（Enemy too weak so didn’t use Master.）</p>
<p>「Guueeeeee….」</p>
<p>The man lay twitching as both his blood and the contents of his last meal leaked from his throat. I mean, he did kind of deserve it given he just tried to hit a little girl. He’s lucky he didn’t get all sliced up and stuff instead.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>But naturally, there existed opinions that differed from our own.</p>
<p>「Hey, Brulace, you alright!?」</p>
<p>「The hell did you do to him you goddamn brat!?」</p>
<p>「Yo, that was way too over the top. The hell man!?」</p>
<p>Brulace’s companions yelled at Fran in rage. It seemed that they wanted a go as well.</p>
<p>Their reddened faces gave way to the fact that they were all drunk. Brulace had been the same, hence his overly quick temper. That said, it wasn’t like we were planning to be all kind and forgiving just because they happened to be under the influence.</p>
<p>Fran immediately disarmed them and sent them flying in the exact same manner as she had Brulace.</p>
<p>「Ugeehh」</p>
<p>「Uuuueeeeee」</p>
<p>I mean, we were kind of the reason they ended up barfing, but I couldn’t help but feel that all four men looked way too gross for comfort. The other people in line seemed to feel the same, as they looked upon the men with eyes of disgust whilst taking a few steps away from them.</p>
<p>Whooops. Turned out we were the first to resort to violence.</p>
<p>Hmm, maybe we should clean all this up?</p>
<p>An older man approached us as we contemplated how we could best address the issue.</p>
<p>「Wow, that was impressive. You seem pretty strong.」</p>
<p>He was quite dandy looking, and probably a noble. The clothes he were were gaudy, they were heavily embroidered and seemed luxurious even from a glance. His whitened hair was arranged in a swept back manner. His beard, which of course, was of the same colour, had been cut to resemble something along the lines of a goatee. Though he seemed to be at least sixty years of age, his body was still so well balanced that it verged on being abnormal. All in all, he seemed to give off the air of an experienced warrior.</p>
<p>I found it a bit weird for him to be happily smiling at and talking to us given the status quo. My guess was that he either had balls of steel or simply couldn’t read the mood.</p>
<p>「My name is Dias. What’s yours?」</p>
<p>「Fran.」</p>
<p>「Are you an adventurer?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I see. You seem quite promising based on how cute and strong you are. I look forward to seeing how you’ll develop going forward.」</p>
<p>Hmmm, just who is this old man? He doesn’t seem to be hostile, and he doesn’t seem to be trying to evaluate Fran or anything like that either.</p>
<p>I mean, my first impression was that he was probably some sort of noble, but he didn’t give his family name when he introduced himself, so he probably either wasn’t one, or belonged to a family too famous for him to want to name himself.</p>
<p>I wanted to appraise him, but, didn’t actually get to. I was instead distracted by the fact that I happened to see a group of guards run over to us from the gate.</p>
<p>「Hey, you, kid.」</p>
<p>The guard’s tone was a rather threatening one. It seemed like we wouldn’t be able to get ourselves out of this one just by claiming self defense. It might work out if the people around us help testify though…</p>
<p>That said, it didn’t seem like anyone wanted to give us a hand. They all immediately averted their gazes the moment Fran looked towards them, as if to signify that they wanted to stay out of the situation given how troublesome it was.</p>
<p>「Geez, why’d you have to go and stir up trouble like that?」</p>
<p>「We’re already busy enough as is.」</p>
<p>「To the guard’s room with you. We’ll listen to what you have to say once we get there.」</p>
<p>「Come on, let’s go.」</p>
<p>We’d already spent an hour in line. It’d really suck if they sent us to the back again afterwards.</p>
<p>The guards sure did seem to be in a bad mood though. The glances they shot in Fran’s direction were totally cold. I wouldn’t be surprised if they ended up just locking us up without actually listening to us.</p>
<p>What I didn’t understand was why they only took us and not the people Fran had hit.</p>
<p>I really didn’t wanted to deal with all this, but it wasn’t like we could just say screw it and leave. Luckily, Dias stopped the guards right as Fran resigned herself to follow them.</p>
<p>「Hold on. None of what’d happened was actually her fault at all.」</p>
<p>「Okay and? Who the hell are you?」</p>
<p>One of the guards glared at Dias in a rather stuck up manner.</p>
<p>『It looks like this might lead to even more trouble.』</p>
<p>Or so I thought, but apparently not.</p>
<p>「D-Dias-<i>sama</i>!」[2]</p>
<p>「W-Whatever might you be doing in a place like this?」</p>
<p>「Oh, you know, I just happened to be passing by.」</p>
<p>Huh, looked like that old man had quite a bit of influence. Looks like he really might be a noble after all.</p>
<p>「Understood sir.」</p>
<p>「As I was saying, she wasn’t at fault at all. All the fault lies with the men collapsed over there, so if you want to be taking anyone away, it should be them. I know they’re filthy, and I do feel bad for you because of it, but you will be taking them in regardless, right?」</p>
<p>「Y-Yessir!」</p>
<p>Ah, I see now. The guards hadn’t wanted to carry off four dirty ass men, so they’d decided to try targeting Fran instead. They might’ve even ended up wronging her as a result, so I do feel fairly thankful for Dias’ actions.</p>
<p>Dias’ words had inspired the guards to immediately bring all four men to their feet and take them away in earnest.</p>
<p>「Thanks.」</p>
<p>「Don’t sweat it. Seeing how promising an adventurer you are just happened to make me feel like keeping you out of trouble is all.」</p>
<p>「Why?」</p>
<p>「Hahaha. Anyways, I’ll be off now. See you around.」</p>
<p>Dias dipped after leaving us with a few words that seemed to be hinting at something. Just who the hell was he? I guess we’ll probably end up finding out when get inside the city.</p>
<p>「Bored.」</p>
<p>『Me too.』</p>
<p>It looked like we’d still have to wait for quite some time before finally being allowed into the city’s walls.</p>
<p>『Whoops. I just realized I totally forgot to appraise him.』</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>[1] I’m pretty sure most WN readers know this already, but comiket is comic market, a huge convention in which they sell all sorts of goodies and porn. Mostly porn. Think of it like a super crowded Anime Expo, but with ten thousand times as much porn. Many of the more popular pornographic artists end up having their stuff completely sold out by the time people in the middle of the line actually manage to enter the facility. Oh yeah, did I mention the porn? That alone makes it worth going to Japan.</p>
<p>[2] Normally I don’t do honorifics, but I haven’t read ahead, so I have absolutely no idea what his actual title is. If anyone’s read ahead and wants to tell me who Dias is, please do so and I’ll be able to get rid of <i>sama </i>and replace it with something appropriate. Anyway, when you append “-sama” to someone’s name, you’re typically doing so because you have great respect for the other party, or you’re just flat out completely subordinated in both mind and body. Individuals in servile positions, like maids and living sex toys often use this to refer to their masters.</p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>142 Bardiche? Sorry, I Meant Erza.</b></p>
<p>We finally made our way through the city’s gates about an hour after meeting Dias.</p>
<p>I quickly looked around, only to find that, the massive, towering, cylindrical building aside, the city was actually surprisingly normal. In fact, seeing it reminded me of Alessa.</p>
<p>『Let’s start off by checking out the Adventurer’s Guild.』</p>
<p><span id="more-638"></span></p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We needed to sell the few materials we did happened across on the way here and get ourselves a bit more info about the city’s two dungeons.</p>
<p>One important fact to note was that not just anyone could just head over to the dungeon and hit it up. You'd need permission and whatnot first. I figured we'd be fine though. Alessa's Guildmaster, Klimut, had given us a permit ahead of time so we probably wouldn't run into any major issues.</p>
<p>Finding the guild ended up being a relatively simple task. We managed to catch sight of it after asking people for directions and walking around for 10 odd minutes. The guild’s building was a fairly large one, which did make sense given that the city contained two dungeons.</p>
<p>『The doors sure are wide, huh?』</p>
<p>「Nn. About same as Barbra.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Barbra’s guild was quite a bit taller, but Ulmutt’s looked like it was built atop a bigger plot of land.</p>
<p>Entering the building made me realize just how large it really was. There were twenty different counters, and the adventurers that sought service from them were in such excess that they had to form lines.</p>
<p>『Holy crap, this place is just bustling with life. It’s even more lively than Barbra’s branch.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Amazed.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Wow, there sure are a lot of adventurers. I thought Barbra was crowded, but holy crap Ulmutt takes it to a whole new level. I mean, it makes sense given the dungeons and whatnot, but still, wow.</p>
<p>Fran immediately moved to the line with the least people in it. The man in front of us turned around in response. Is someone seriously about to pick a fight with us already?</p>
<p>I position myself to “accidentally slip out of my sheath” at any given moment.</p>
<p>「Just so you know, this line’s only supposed to be for E rankers.」</p>
<p>Turned out he was just bringing it to our attention that we might be in the wrong place.</p>
<p>The man briefed us on how things were organised. There were five different types of lines, each of which had four corresponding counters. The first four types were for G, F, E, and D ranked adventurers respectively, whereas the last handled everyone that ranked in at C or higher.</p>
<p>Fran moved over one line after hearing him out.</p>
<p>「Oh come on, listen to me goddamit. That one’s supposed to be for D rankers.」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「I literally just told you you’re not supposed to use that line unless you’re a D ranked adventurer.」</p>
<p>You know, the dude who called out to us looked all intimidating and stuff, but he was actually a pretty nice guy. I mean, he did make light of Fran’s abilities and all that, but it wasn't like he did out out of malice or anything. He'd only called out to her in the first place in order to patiently instruct on something he realized she didn’t know.</p>
<p>I had a feeling that this was just things tended to be in Ulmutt. There were quite a few other younger individuals lined up around us as well, though Fran was still definitely the youngest of them all. Most of the younger crowd seemed to be about 15 years old, and there were far more of them than there were back in Alessa.</p>
<p>「That’s why this line.」</p>
<p>「Huh?」</p>
<p>「Currently D ranked.」</p>
<p>「Whaaat?」</p>
<p>Her proclamation seemed to have surprised not only the man that’d been giving her advice, but also the adventurers around us as well. Many had turned their heads in disbelief.</p>
<p>「Here.」</p>
<p>Fran showed the man her guild card and immediately caused his eyes to widen in shock.</p>
<p>「The guild card says… it’s true… Wait, what? You’re higher ranked than me?」</p>
<p>「Damn, seriously?」</p>
<p>「She’s higher ranked than me too!?」</p>
<p>「She must’ve cheated or something.」</p>
<p>「Y-Yeah, figures.」</p>
<p>「But what if she really is that strong?」</p>
<p>The adventurers around us started kicking up a fuss. Fran, however, didn’t really care at all.</p>
<p>「Hey! You!」</p>
<p>Annnnd someone tried picking a fight with us. I knew this would happen, especially with all the commotion.</p>
<p>「You're a liar!」</p>
<p>「Not lying.」</p>
<p>「There’s no way a kid like you could be an adventurer! That cards probably a fake!」</p>
<p>「You, also kid.」</p>
<p>「N-No I’m not! I’m already 15!」</p>
<p>This was honestly pretty much the usual save for the fact that the person trying to pick a fight with us was a kid. The teenage boy glared at Fran with his face dyed a shade of bright red.</p>
<p>「Genuine card.」</p>
<p>「I-I don’t believe you!」</p>
<p>「Genuine.」</p>
<p>「T-There’s no way that’s legit! Even I’m still just G ranked!」</p>
<p>He refused to believe that he was in the wrong, not that I can really blame him too much seeing as how Fran being a D ranker is kind of surreal in and of itself. What to do though? Like, there’s no way we could rough him up like we usually would, seeing as how he’s just a kid and all that.</p>
<p>（Master, use violence?）</p>
<p>『Hold on.』</p>
<p>（Nn? Why?）</p>
<p>Though I thought him to be nothing but a brat, there was no way for me really judge if Fran felt the same. I honestly couldn't tell if she thought of him a young or old seeing as how she was the younger of the two. That said, she obviously did see him as someone that annoyed her and tried to pick a fight with her either way.</p>
<p>『He’s just a brat, so let’s just let him off.』</p>
<p>（Then what do?）</p>
<p>『Hmmmm…』</p>
<p>Oh, right. We could totally just use wind magic to make him shut up for the time being. We’ll still deal with him normally if he actually tries something though.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that we’d went ahead and planned out what to do, we never actually ended up getting a chance to put our ideas into action.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「What’s going on here?」</p>
<p>Oh, it’s Miss Erza.</p>
<p>「Geez, are you guys causing trouble again? You boys sure are naughty.」</p>
<p>「――――！」</p>
<p>『――――！』</p>
<p>Both Fran and I completely froze the moment we caught sight of the person that came out from the guild’s rear. Fran, who’d always been taciturn and calm, had her eyes wide open in surprise. I feel like that this might’ve been the first time I’d ever seen her in such a state. That said, I understood her sentiments. The person we caught sight of was one whose presence truly gave off a sense of impact.</p>
<p>「M-Miss Erza.」</p>
<p>「Oh my, would you happen to be the source of all this fuss, Yuuri?」</p>
<p>「Er… no, I’m not. It’s just that there happened to be a kid playing around inside the guild, so I was just telling them off is all.」</p>
<p>The boy that’d been picking a fight with Fran, Yuuri, suddenly became all obedient. He immediately began standing at attention. Likewise, all the other adventurers had stopped slouching and straightened their backs as well.</p>
<p>「A kid? Oh my, how adorable she is.」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>『Fran』</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>『Fran!』</p>
<p>「Was just bit surprised.」</p>
<p>『You alright?』</p>
<p>「Oh my, what is it?」</p>
<p>It seemed that this was Fran’s first time meeting anyone like the person standing before us. Again, I couldn’t blame her since I’d totally been taken aback as well.</p>
<p>「Nice to meet you, my name’s Erza.」</p>
<p>「Fran.」</p>
<p>「Fran, is it? Wonderful, I do hope we get along.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Just one question.」</p>
<p>「Whatever might that be?」</p>
<p>「Male? Or Female?」</p>
<p>The man that called himself Erza took a pose as if to show off his buff ass body while also lightly pressing a finger against one of his lips. He then winked and blew a kiss in Fran’s direction. Oh god why!?</p>
<p>「S e c r e t.」</p>
<p>Secret my ass! He’s totally a dude!</p>
<p>Though I wanted to call him out on his bullshit, I couldn’t help but feel that it was a horrible idea to do so.</p>
<p>The way he was twisting his body around didn’t actually seem all that gross. In fact, it didn’t leave that bad of an impression on me at all, though I’d say that was probably mostly because of how ridiculous the rest of him appeared.</p>
<p>He wore heavy makeup on his cheeks, and thick eyeshadow on his eyes. His lips were covered in a red purple lipstick, and his head topped with a crimson afro. You could easily make out both his tights and muscular body even despite him wearing a layer of leather armour. Holy shit, he was a legit homo manwoman.</p>

<p>I felt an incredible urge to complain about a bunch of different stuff. Like, firstly, his goddamn name was Bardiche, not Erza. Secondly, how the hell did he look like he was 30!? That said though, both the aforementioned aspects paled before the one thing I <i>really</i> wanted to complain about, one of his skills.</p>
<p>Pain Conversion: Converts some pain to pleasure.</p>
<p>That skill right there was a masochist’s best friend. Wait, does this mean that there’s skills specialized for sadists as well? Like maybe something that boosts one’s stats when bullying people or inflicting pain or something?</p>
<p>Either way, it seemed like the masochistic homosexual before us was one of the most powerful people I’d ever met after reincarnating.</p>
<p>Man, appraising him sure wore me the hell out… That’s the first time that’s happened…</p>
<p>「Are you the same little lady that happened to get into a fight just outside the city’s gates?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Would you mind coming with me then? The guildmaster told me to bring you his way if I happened to find you.」</p>
<p>「Guildmaster?」</p>
<p>「Yuppers. He seems to have some business with you. Would you mind?」</p>
<p>Did he want to scold us or something? I don’t really think what we did was serious enough for us to need to have the guildmaster personally see to us.</p>
<p>Well, either way, it was one of the Guildmaster’s personal requests, so it’s not like we could actually turn it down at all.</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>「Thankies. I’ll be taking her then everyone.」</p>
<p>「Sure thing.」</p>
<p>「Oh, and Yuuri, you should be a bit more vigilant, you know? You’ll die the moment you set foot in a dungeon if you’re bad at judging how strong people are.」</p>
<p>「Huh? What?」</p>
<p>「Over here Fran~」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran followed Bardiche… Erza? Uhhh… I guess I'll go with Erza, whatever.</p>
<p>Fran followed Erza as she led her in over to the Guildmaster.</p>
<p>「Hmmm hmm hm hm hmmm hmmm」</p>
<p>Oh god why! Stop shaking your ass while you walk around goddammit!</p>

		<p><b>143. The Guildmaster’s Identity<br>
</b></p>
<p>Erza (♂) took us towards the Guildmaster’s room by leading us up a flight of stairs. We had Urushi sit back in the shadows since we were visiting someone important and all that.</p>
<p>「I’ve brought Fran over as requested, Guildmaster.」</p>
<p><span id="more-645"></span></p>
<p>「Thank you Erza, and hello again, Fran.」</p>
<p>「Dias.」</p>
<p>「I’m glad to see you still remember me.」</p>
<p>We were surprised to see a familiar face, the man that’d given us a hand just outside the city’s walls, awaiting us in the Guildmaster’s office. He seemed to have been expecting us, as he was standing in his room with a wide smile on his face.</p>
<p>「Dias is Guildmaster?」</p>
<p>「I am. I guess I’ll reintroduce myself. I am Dias, the Master of Ulmutt’s Adventurer’s Guild.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Hope to get along.」</p>
<p>Ah, so he was the Guildmaster. I see, I get it now. The guards were addressing him all respectfully and stuff because he was the person in charge of the adventurers in a city with a tonne of adventurers.</p>
<p>Oh right, I better appraise him before I forget again.</p>

<p>Hmmm, he sure seemed strong. Both his stats and skills looked flat out ridiculous, and he appeared as if he was capable of combat at pretty much any range. He had a lot of skills that’d led him take advantage of his enemies’ weak points too. Magic show related skills aside, he more or less looked to be an assassin.</p>
<p>He even had a unique skill to top it all off.</p>
<p>Technically Senile: Forces the target to forget that they have a certain skill for a fixed time period. This time period and Technically Senile’s cooldown are both dependant on the target skill’s level and rarity. Maximum period of senility: 1 minute.</p>
<p>Holy crap that’s OP. Forgetting you have a skill in the middle of combat could be flat out fatal.</p>
<p>Induced Thought: Allows the caster to momentarily redirect the target’s train of thought.<br>
Induced Line of Sight: Allows the caster to momentarily redirect the target’s line of sight.</p>
<p>His two innate skills, combined with Inconspicuous, Espionage, and other similar abilities, would probably allow him to make his opponents completely lose track of him, especially if he was to make use of his illusion based magics. The name of his job seemed to hint at the fact that he specialized in using the illusory arts in conjunction with magic trick-like abilities, meaning that he was actually much more difficult to deal with than his stats seemed to indicate.</p>
<p>「Hahaha. It seems that you just appraised me.」</p>
<p>Wait, how?</p>
<p>「The Appraisal Detection skill allows me to sense those capable of using appraisal. It also lets me know if it gets used on me. Out of curiosity, can you see my unique skill?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I knew it. Your appraisal sure is high leveled. I’d actually used it when we met a bit earlier so you’d forget to appraise me, just so I wouldn’t get found out cause I wanted to give you a bit of a surprise here and now. Sadly, you don’t look even the slightest bit surprised though. Looks like my little prank ended up failing.」</p>
<p>Oh, right, that explains why I kept forgetting to appraise him back then. Man, I knew something was off back then. In fact, I was so confident that I was getting paranoid that I was being attacked by a Stand.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Okay, yeah no, that was just flat out bullshit. I’d honestly blamed it on my own carelessness.</p>
<p>「Your appraisal skill sure is high leveled though. You put my skill on a three day cooldown, and I didn’t even manage to successfully prank you. Man, I wish I never bothered.」</p>
<p>「Your own fault.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I know. I’ll make your stay here a lot more convenient as an apology, so could you please stop glaring at me already?」</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

        </div>
        
<p>So that whole gentlemanly act he pulled off outside town was all just a ruse for the sake of a prank? The boyish way he put his hands together and lowered his head made it look like my guess was perfectly on the mark. Fran seemed a bit peeved as well, but it’s not like he actually caused us any harm. In fact, he’d even given us a hand, so I guess we don’t really have any choice but to forgive him.</p>
<p>「…Will get mad next time.」</p>
<p>Is it really normal for him to just go around using that skill on people? I feel like he’d be put in a pretty bad place if the person he tried to mess with ended up finding out. They might take his use of the skill as a sign of hostility and choose to engage him in battle.</p>
<p>「Seriously Guildmaster? You did it <i>again</i>? Do you really like playing pranks on all the promising newbies that much?」</p>
<p>Looks like this isn’t just a one off thing. Is it really alright for the Guildmaster to do stuff like that?</p>
<p>「You can just hit him if he starts to get him on your nerves, Fran.」</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>「Nice, I’ll be cheering you on then! I hope that silly Guildmaster of ours ends up suffering just a bit some day.」</p>
<p>「Wow Erza, you’re terrible.」</p>
<p>「I mean, you’re the one always pushing it just because they’ll never fire you, so you kinda deserve it.」</p>
<p>「Why never fire?」</p>
<p>I was a bit curious about that as well. I mean, Guildmasters had authority and all that, but their positions weren’t nearly influential enough to allow them to permanently hold their titles.</p>
<p>「Well, you see, he’s really strong. He’s definitely one of Kranzel’s top five. I’m one of the strongest B ranked adventurers out there, but I’m not even the slightest bit close to even being his match, mkay? That make sense honey?」</p>
<p>Wow, is he really that strong? I mean, their stats don’t look <i>that</i> different, so I guess it’s based on how well they apply their skills. Erza seems like the brute force type, so he’d probably get screwed from having holes poked in his weak points.</p>
<p>「He’s strong enough to be worthy of his title as Guildmaster of a city containing two different dungeons. Mhmm.」</p>
<p>Well, yeah, he does seem several times stronger than most other adventurers.</p>
<p>「And he’s the only one capable of negotiating with the Dungeon Master too. Yuppers.」</p>
<p>Negotiating with the Dungeon Master? The hell’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p>「Negotiate?」</p>
<p>「Oh, right, you just got here. Ulmutt’s gotten really famous because it’s got two dungeons, both of which are still alive. They’ve even got their Dungeon Masters still inside of them.」</p>
<p>「Dangerous.」</p>
<p>「Normally, yeah, but Ulmutt’s fine, so no worries there honey.」</p>
<p>「Why?」</p>
<p>「Well, it’s because we made a deal with the Dungeon Masters. The Dungeon Masters have agreed not to strengthen the dungeon any more than absolutely necessary or tell their monsters to invade the city. They’ve also agreed to tolerate adventurers and their actions within the dungeon’s confines. In exchange, we provide the Dungeon Masters supplies from outside their dungeons and agree not to touch them or the dungeons’ cores. Yuppers.」</p>
<p>Ah, I see. I guess this is something that becomes possible under the condition that the Dungeon Master is of an intelligent race. It’d make sense for said Dungeon Master to prefer coexistence to getting destroyed by high ranking adventurers.</p>
<p>「The Guildmaster was the first person to succeed in negotiating with the Dungeon Master. Mhmm. He did it back in his younger days.」</p>
<p>「Man, it was really hard, and took forever.」</p>
<p>「I don’t really know why the Dungeon Masters trust this old man, but, they’ve appointed him as a point of interaction, so we kinnnda don’t have the slightest clue what’d happen to the guild if he quit. Ulmutt only exists for its dungeons, so there’s really no way for anyone to fire the Guildmaster without bringing about a tonne of harm.」</p>
<p>「Heh, and you know what that means? I get to do whatever I want, and no one can stop me.」</p>
<p>「That’s not something that’s supposed to make you act with such a irresponsible attitude!」</p>
<p>Holy crap. I think I need glasses. I swear I just saw a homo manwoman scolding an old man in the same manner as she would a brat.</p>
<p>「Mmm, I think it’s about time for me to excuse myself.」</p>
<p>「Keep up the good work.」</p>
<p>「You really shouldn’t be saying that seeing as how you’re the one that keeps making me work harder than I should be!」</p>
<p>You know, I could actually kinda get use to this. Their interactions, I mean.</p>
<p>「See you later Fran. I really think I’ve taken a liking to you, so tell me if you ever need anything. I’ll help you out if I can. Mhmm, yes I will.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Byebye~ Muah~」</p>
<p>Oh god why, he just threw a kiss in at the end just to do it! Holy crap, that was dangerous. I almost instinctively moved my body out of its path and got myself caught in action by Dias.</p>
<p>（Master, something wrong? Twitchy.）</p>
<p>『I-It’s nothing, don’t worry about it.』</p>
<p>Though, it seems like Fran actually did notice.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>

		<p><b>144. Dias’ Abilities<br>
</b><br>
The Guildmaster breathed a light sigh not too long after Erza’s departure.</p>
<p>「Whew. He’s not a bad guy, but I find myself having a bit of a hard time dealing with him.」</p>
<p>I’m guessing he means that he can’t stand Erza on a physiological level or something like that. Fran seems fine, but that's more so because she hasn’t really developed a sense of personal space yet.</p>
<p><span id="more-652"></span></p>
<p>「He’s what I would call a little bit special, you see.」</p>
<p>「Man, but also woman?」</p>
<p>「That’s a part of it.」</p>
<p>A part? There’s more to it?</p>
<p>「Other parts too?」</p>
<p>「It looks like you’ll be stuck dealing with him for quite the time to come, so I guess there shouldn’t be any problems with me telling you. Besides, I’d end up with a few concerns over my own safety if you were to fall into his venomous clutches.」</p>
<p>Dias muttered several things under his breath with a serious look on his face; he seemed to be lost in thought.</p>
<p>「Erza’s what you’d call a man with a woman’s heart. He’s equally interested in both men and women alike, and his tastes span the generations as far as age goes. In fact, both you and I fall into his strike zone. He’s even got an inclination that makes him happy when abused by others.」</p>
<p>『…』</p>
<p>（Master?）</p>
<p>『Holy shit! I think I actually just blanked out for a second.』</p>
<p>So he’s a masochistic bisexual manwoman attracted to basically everything and anything? Like, isn’t he, as a living thing, supposed to have instincts that make him only want to tap to certain things? Whatever the hell happened to those? Holy crap, I think this has gone so far that I’m starting to feel physical harm. Each of these facts is as bad as a blow to the gut. I’mma say we should stay as far away from him as possible, for sanity’s sake.</p>
<p>「???」</p>
<p>All of what we’d discussed seemed to have gone right over Fran’s head. I can practically see a bunch of question marks floating on top of her.</p>
<p>（Master? Understand?）</p>
<p>『I-I do, but I think it’s fine for you not to get it for now.』</p>
<p>（Why?）</p>
<p>『I-It’s a subject for grown ups. You don’t need to get it yet. In fact, I think you’d be happier not getting it than getting it.』</p>
<p>（Hm?）</p>
<p>I’d honestly rather prefer that she never gets it, if anything.</p>
<p>『A-All you really have to know is that Erza’s a bit of a weirdo. That’s it.』</p>
<p>（Nn. Got it.）</p>
<p>Whew. Thank god that’s over. I was pretty confident that I’d end up losing my ability to think rationally if I had to actually explain Erza’s <i>inclinations</i>.</p>
<p>「Erza doesn’t believe in simply watching over children lovingly and will act on his urges, but that isn’t to say that he actively goes after them himself either. Despite all else, he still is technically Ulmutt’s ace, so some children do end up developing odd tastes and approaching him on their own.」</p>
<p>Oh, so that’s what he meant by falling into Erza’s venomous clutches? Yeah no, that’s more like getting flat out poisoned and corrupted.</p>
<p>「To tell you the truth, I was actually warned by a certain individual ahead of time that I shouldn’t let you fall into Erza’s clutches… I’m pretty sure I’d end up getting murdered by said individual if I did.」</p>
<p>「Certain individual?」</p>
<p>「Amanda of Hairiti. One of your acquaintances, I presume?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「She’d sent me a letter by hawk. Here, feel free to take a look if you’d like to see it.」</p>
<p>Dias smiled bitterly as he showed us the letter. It named Fran and described her features before going on and on about how cute and good a kid she was. It ended off by saying that she’d probably stand out, and that Dias should be aware of the fact that other adventurers would likely try to pick on her. It more or less coerced Dias to figure something out and do something about the fact that Erza would definitely end up taking a liking to Fran.</p>
<p>「Erza and Amanda are on pretty good terms, but Amanda refuses to budge when it comes to anything related to children.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I mean, again, he’s really not that bad a guy though…」</p>
<p>I really ought to thank Amanda. We owe her so much for having the Guildmaster help us with this whole Erza thing. I mean, we’re grateful she helped us get in touch with the Guildmaster period, but the Erza thing was what truly made me feel like thanking her from the bottom of my heart. Like, I know Erza’s not that bad a guy or anything like that, but chances were, I would’ve flat out snapped if Erza ended up taking a liking to us and following us around everywhere all round the clock.</p>
<p>「Alrighty… Would you mind if we changed topics and started addressing something a bit more serious?」</p>
<p>Dias’ face suddenly went solemn as he brought both hands together in front of him much in the same manner as Commander Ik*ri.</p>
<p>「That sword isn’t just your average everyday sword, is it?」</p>
<p>The next words that came out of his mouth had all the effectiveness of an explosive.</p>
<p>『What!?』</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>「Heh, curious as to why I found out? How about appraise me again if you want to know?」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Come on, just give it a shot. I tricked you the first time, you know?」</p>
<p>Hmmm… I guess I’ll do as he says. I’m curious as to how he managed to figure me out, so yeah.</p>
<p>I ended up trying to appraise him again after a moment’s worth of contemplation.</p>
<p>（Master?）</p>
<p>『Hmmm…? He’s got more skills….?』</p>
<p>There weren’t any differences in his stats or skill levels. However, he had two more skills than he had last time: Appraisal Cover Up and Mind Reading. Both new skills were level 8.</p>
<p>「You see them?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Appraisal Cover Up can either be used to disguise one’s entire stat page, but that’s not it. You can also focus the skill’s effects on a few specific items in order to completely and totally hide them. I’ve been doing the latter to hide Mind Reading, my trump card.」</p>
<p>Holy shit. Dias’ skillset lets him go after weak points, so giving him a skill like that just flat out makes him completely borked.</p>
<p>「Mind Reading can be used to outwit people, especially when paired with Technically Senile. I’d love to have Appraisal as well, but it seems I don’t really have any affinity for the skill. I just can’t get it no matter how hard I try. Oh well, it’s pretty easy to figure out what weapon and magic based skills someone's got just by looking at them, and most people tend to think about their skills right before they use them, so I can just deal with whatever comes at me by reading my opponent’s mind ahead of time.」</p>
<p>As I analyzed the skill, I came to realize a pressing issue.</p>
<p>Mind Reading: Allows one to catch a glimpse of a target’s thoughts.</p>
<p>His skill didn’t specify that it could only read the minds of people or intelligent animals. Does that mean he can read my thoughts as well? Even though I’m a sword? Wait, wait, can he read the mind of anything capable of actual thought period?</p>
<p>「Heheheh, looks like you’re panicking. Have you figured it out? It’s exactly as you think. This skill allowed me to come to realize that your sword can think too, Fran.」</p>
<p>『Shit, he just totally read Fran’s mind again.』</p>
<p>「Oh, just so you know, I don’t actually go around randomly reading people’s minds, you know? I just happened to catch sight of the fight you were involved in earlier. I figured I’d read your mind and step in if you happened to want to kill the people that’d bothered you, which would’ve been a fairly easy task seeing as how bloodlust is a simple thing to read. It just so happened that I overheard you seemingly having a telepathic conversation, at which point in time I realized that your sword had the ability to think too.」</p>
<p>So he knew about me right from the moment he first called out to us? Is this why he called Fran here to begin with?</p>
<p>「So why don’t you tell me about that sword of yours?」</p>
<p>（What do?）</p>
<p>『Hmm… It looks like he’s figured most of it out anyway. He’d probably actually get mad if we kept trying to hide anything else, so…』</p>
<p>That said, it wasn’t like he had any real evidence. Playing dumb is probably still an option. We don’t really know what his goal is here, and if worse comes to worst, he might even end up trying to confiscate me and wield me for himself.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Hahaha, it looks like you really don’t trust me at all. Don’t worry, I won’t do anything that’ll make you worse off. I’ll even swear it in Amanda’s name. I owe her a great deal, so I wouldn’t be able to face her if I wronged you in any which way. Plus, I already told you about my own trump card, so it’s only fair for you to tell me about yours. Right? Come on.」</p>
<p>Dias’ smile contained not even the slightest trace of malice, and it didn’t seem like he was lying either…</p>
<p>Hah…. Well, I guess it can’t be helped. We’ll be staying here for a while, so I don’t want to make an enemy out of the Guildmaster. He’d probably end up figuring out whatever we were thinking anyways, even if we did try to pull one over him.</p>
<p>『Do you mind?』</p>
<p>（Nn. Can’t be helped.）</p>
<p>He pretty much knows anyways.</p>
<p>『I guess it can’t be helped then.』</p>
<p>「Woah, w-was that the sword just now…?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, hi. Fran’s sword speaking.』</p>
<p>「Hahaha! Wow! You can actually speak, just like a human!? I was not expecting that.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Master amazing.」</p>
<p>「Master?」</p>
<p>And so, we did the usual and had Fran explain my name and effectively force the other person to praise it. Luckily, Dias was pretty good at reading the mood, so he complimented Fran’s naming sense a whole bunch, almost too much, in fact.</p>
<p>『So did you need something from me? Or were you just curious?』</p>
<p>「Right, my bad. This is my first time seeing an intelligent weapon, so I ended up getting carried away out of excitement. I admit I was a bit curious, but I also wanted to give the two of you a bit of advice.」</p>
<p>「Advice?」</p>
<p>「Yes, advice. Master, Appraisal isn’t too uncommon a skill, but, it seems you’ve kind of just been using it all willy nilly?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, pretty much.』</p>
<p>「I know that I’m not really qualified to say this myself seeing as how I read people’s minds, but you should be more careful on who you use it on since it’ll expose everything they wish to keep a secret. There’s a fair number of people out there who really hate nobles and royals, so you may end up getting arrested under the pretense of being a spy should you be caught using appraisal on either of those two types of people. Many royals even have appraisal detection, so you'll be noticed immediately. And do keep in mind that the crime will end up falling on Fran’s shoulders in your case.」</p>
<p>You know, he’s got a pretty good point now that I think about it. Appraisal lets you pretty much see everything, so people with lots of secrets would probably hate for it to be used on them. I’d never actually thought about the skill from that kind of perspective before.</p>
<p>「I’m sure that Fran will ultimately end up meeting royals on multiple occasions in the future due to how promising an adventurer she seems, so do take heed of this for when that happens. If not, then…」</p>
<p>Dias gave his neck a light chop instead of finishing his sentence with words.</p>
<p>Yeah, makes sense. Pissing off royalty isn’t exactly something you could get away with, at least not easily. Putting it like that, randomly using Appraisal can lead to terrifying results. I guess I’ll be a bit more prudent.</p>
<p>「That’s all for Appraisal related advice. I still want to advise you on something else too though.」</p>
<p>「Something else?」</p>
<p>「You guys haven’t really leveled your detection type skills, have you?」</p>
<p>『What makes you think that?』</p>
<p>「It’s because you didn’t realize when I used Technically Senile, Mind Reading, Induced Thought, or Induced Line of Sight. I mean, I am good at hiding the fact that I’m using them, but you guys are just way too defenseless, you know? Strength in combat aside, you guys are really unguarded for people that’ve got something to hide, you're just flat out unbalanced. You should’ve been able to realize that something was amiss had you trained your ability to detect as much as you had your ability to fight.」</p>
<p>We do have a whole slew of detection type skills, but most of them are rather low leveled. The highest would be Presence Detection, and even that’s just level 5.</p>
<p>『So is having level 5 Presence Detection just not enough?』</p>
<p>「It isn’t. You’ll either want at least one level 8 skill or three level 6 skills if you want to go up against any tougher opponents.」</p>
<p>Both those options are pretty far off.</p>
<p>「It isn’t an absolute necessity in general. You could always act in much the same manner as Erza, who claims to have nothing to hide, but that wouldn’t quite do for the two of you now, would it?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, I’d like as few people to know about me as possible.』</p>
<p>「I happen to have a pretty good place for you guys to train. Want to check it out?」</p>
<p>『You mean the dungeon?』</p>
<p>「Exactly. You know that Ulmutt’s got two dungeons, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「The western dungeon is for beginners. It contains very few traps, and most of the magic beasts inside of it will fight you head on. It’s a good place for newbies to grind up their levels. The eastern one is effectively the western’s opposite. It’s for more experienced adventurers, and contains lots of traps. The magic beasts within it also like to set up ambushes, with the inclination only growing stronger as you dive deeper into the dungeon’s depths. Many D ranked adventurers have ended up losing their lives within the eastern dungeon’s confines.」</p>
<p>『So what you’re saying is that you want us to head to the eastern one to train up our detection skills?』</p>
<p>「You guessed it. The eastern dungeon is perfect for anyone that wants to get better at detection. So, how about it? You probably won’t be able to suddenly bump your skill levels up, but it should still be worth your time. You normally have to prove yourself in the western dungeon before being admitted to the eastern one, but I’ll offer you guys a chance to bypass all that if you want.」</p>
<p>『I guess that’s fine? I mean, we were planning to go dungeon diving anyways…』</p>
<p>I don’t really know if we’ll manage to actually start leveling our skills up, but, we should at least be able to train a bit in order to actually get better at using some of them. It’s usually pretty hard to get practice with detection based skills, so I’m totally fine with taking that as a bit of an added bonus. That said though, I can’t help but feel a bit bothered by all this.</p>
<p>『But why go so far?』</p>
<p>I just can’t seem to bring myself to trust him. I doubt he’d do this much for us sheerly out of good will.</p>
<p>「Hahaha, I’m not trying to trick you, you know? It’s just that this happens to be something that benefits the guild.」</p>
<p>「Nn? Me exploring east dungeon benefits guild?」</p>
<p>「Yes it does. The western dungeon is filled with newbies, none of which will actually be able to tell how strong you are. I can say for sure that you’ll end up getting in even more trouble if you end up going west.」</p>
<p>Ah, I see. The tournament is coming up soon, so Ulmutt’s getting a huge influx of adventurers. With more people, you tend to get more idiots, meaning more people that’d try to pick a fight with Fran. The guild would probably be pretty happy if it manages to minimize the amount of commotion caused by her.</p>
<p>「There are very few adventurers exploring the eastern dungeon to begin with, but those that are are also relatively experienced. They likely won’t mess with you so long as the guild makes an announcement or two.」</p>
<p>『Hence, you’d prefer us dive into the eastern dungeon as opposed to the western one?』</p>
<p>「Exactly, it’s a deal that benefits us both. So, how about it?」</p>
<p>『What do you think, Fran?』</p>
<p>「I don’t mind.」</p>
<p>「Good, good. It looks like you’re nice and motivated.」</p>
<p>The Guildmaster seemed to have expected our answer, as he immediately pulled an eastern dungeon permit with Fran’s name carefully inscribed on it. Holy crap, he was totally ready for us.</p>
<p>Real talk, I really can’t hate Dias, but I can’t bring myself to trust him either.</p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>145. The Reference Letter</b></p>
<p>Fran examined the permit she got from Dias by flipping it over and shining a light on it.</p>
<p>「Is something wrong?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Might have hidden mechanism.」</p>
<p>「Hahaha, wow, you’re mean. I’m right here, you know?」</p>
<p><span id="more-661"></span></p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>Dias had made his claim with a smile on his face, but that hadn't been nearly enough for him to earn Fran's trust, she continued to gaze at the letter suspiciously regardless.</p>
<p>「Just trust me on this okay? I won’t play any more pranks on you. The only pranks I ever play are ones that end up benefiting the adventurers that get pranked, you know?」</p>
<p>「Meaning?」</p>
<p>「Think of my pranks as a form of parental love. I use them to make sure everyone doesn’t get too relaxed on a day to day basis. I don’t just play them to have fun.」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>Fran stared down Dias, whose expression remained serious despite his obvious bullshitting. I didn’t even need the Principle of Falsehood to know he was straight up lying to our faces.</p>
<p>「Well… Okay, I guess it is half for my own entertainment.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「A-Ah, right, that reminds me. Just letting you into the eastern dungeon isn’t all I’ve come up with. I’ve also got a few other ideas that’ll benefit you.」</p>
<p>The Guildmaster ended up just flat out changing the topic, not that I really mind given that I was interested in what he'd brought up.</p>
<p>『Other ideas, you say?』</p>
<p>「Yeah. To be more exact, I’ve thought up three different courses of action. The first is to issue a proclamation regarding the protection of younger adventurers, something we, as the guild, ourselves would also benefit from. I’m fairly certain that this is something you’ve already noticed, but Ulmutt’s got a relatively large proportion of younger adventurers.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Our dungeons [1] fall in somewhere in the lower D ranked area, but we’ve a system that allows F and G ranked adventurers to explore the upper floors regardless so long as they party up with people ranked in at E or higher. This system really helps newbies that want to gain experience, as well as G rankers, as they aren’t allowed to enter any of the country’s other dungeons.」</p>
<p>「That’s why, G ranked kids, lots?」</p>
<p>「Exactly. The problem lies with the fact that many of the people out there like to take advantage of them. They manipulate them and use them as bait. I’ve been thinking of enforcing a penalty for actions like that for quite some time now.」</p>
<p>So Fran just happened to end up as the spark that’d set his plan into action? Makes sense.</p>
<p>「Second?」</p>
<p>「My second idea would be to go around telling everyone how much Erza likes you. Ulmutt’s adventurers typically prefer to be on his good side rather than not.」</p>
<p>Right. All the adventurers seemed to quiet down the moment he showed up. Yup, makes sense. There’s no way anyone would be willing to go head to head with <i>that</i> after all.</p>
<p>「Last?」</p>
<p>「That would be to quickly raise your rank.」</p>
<p>「??」</p>
<p>「You know, Fran, the guild really values all the contributions you’ve made to it. We’ll bump you up to C rank the moment you complete enough requests to qualify yourself for it.」</p>
<p>「Surprised.」</p>
<p>Yeah, me too. Was it because they took what we did back in Barbra into consideration?</p>
<p>「The royalty you escorted named you an incredibly valuable asset. The reports they sent contained nothing but praise.」</p>
<p>Oh, he must be talking about when we escorted Prince Flut and Princess Satia.</p>
<p>Fran’s expression remained unchanged, but I felt Dias’ words ignite a fiery passion within her.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">

        </div>
        
<p>「Will do best.」</p>
<p>「Please do. We’ll do for you as we have for every other adventurer that's reached C rank here at the Ulmutt branch and make a series announcements in order to spread your name far and wide. That way, almost everyone in the city will know you’re a C rank, and consequently, there’ll be far fewer people that’ll want to try picking a fight with you.」</p>
<p>Fewer? So there still will be some? Can't be helped, I guess. Oh well, that works too. Less is always more when it comes to this kinda thing.</p>
<p>「I’ll give you a few requests you can complete during your time in the eastern dungeon. You should be able to finish them and easily rank yourself up while going through with your training. 」</p>
<p>Dias handed us twenty something requests as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>「You’ll need to complete another 23 D ranked requests if you want to qualify for C rank. Take all these, and start doing what you can.」</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>『Thanks.』</p>
<p>And so, we ended up being allowed into the dungeon. I’d been expecting us to have to be examined or something, but I guess this is fine too. It’s a shame that Klimut’s reference letter ended up going to waste, but oh well.</p>
<p>Actually, I guess there’s no harm in giving it to him anyways, right?</p>
<p>「Here.」</p>
<p>「That looks like… Alessa’s Guild’s crest. Would that be a letter from Klimut?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Reference letter.」</p>
<p>Dias’ face paled in unease the moment Fran nodded to affirm his suspicions. Wait, what? You okay, old dude?</p>
<p>「By the way, Fran.」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「Umm… You’re not going to tell Klimut about how I tried to play a bit of a prank on you, right?」</p>
<p>For some odd reason, his tone voice of voice had immediately turned into a flattering one.</p>
<p>「Why?」</p>
<p>「I guess it’d be better for me to say since I’m the one asking for a favour here. Klimut is one of my seniors and someone I look up to as an adventurer. He gave me a hand when I was just starting out, so I owe him quite a bit. I wouldn’t be able to bring myself to face him if you told him what I did. Er, actually, that's not it at all. To be honest, I’m just flat out terrified of him.」</p>
<p>I’d used the Principle of Falsehood to verify his words, and apparently, he wasn’t lying. He was actually afraid of Klimut.</p>
<p>Well, I’m glad that reference letter of ours ended up actually seeing some use. In fact, it more or less ended up functioning as a sort of trump card, huh?</p>
<p>「Will tell Amanda and Klimut next time something weird done.」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry. I’ll never do anything weird to you ever again.」</p>
<p>You know, it’s really pretty are to see a Guildmaster prostrate himself on all fours. Man, I wish I had a camera right now. Oh well, either way, it looked like Dias is going to stop with his pranks now, so all’s good. [2]</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>「Hahaha…」</p>
<p>Seeing Fran take a haughty stance while holding Klimut’s letter with Dias prostrating before her almost made me want to say “Case Closed!”</p>

    < /br>

        
		<p><b>146. The Whereabouts of Those Sought</b></p>
<p>I made sure to double check a few details regarding our detection skills before we left Dias’ office.</p>
<p>Specifically, I asked him to once again verify that we'd only need either a single level 8 skill or 3 level 6 skills.</p>
<p><span id="more-668"></span></p>
<p>「Personally, I can figure out when someone’s using Appraisal right away because I’ve got the Appraisal Detection skill, but it's normally quite difficult to catch someone in the act of it. The skill is honestly quite a stealthy one. The same goes for connoisseur and mind reading type skills. They're all pretty to detect.」</p>
<p>That sounds like something that’d make people with secrets to hide go crazy with anxiety. Someone could find out whatever it is you’re trying to hide without you ever being the wiser.</p>
<p>「Skills like Induced Thought and Technical Senility are much more difficult to cover up. Even I can’t make them totally undetectable despite having both the skills at a fairly high level.」</p>
<p>Neither the Appraisal or Connoisseur-type skills involved invoking any sort of effect that'd influence their targets. All you had to do to activate either was look at whatever it is you wanted to know more about, and that was it.</p>
<p>Induced Thought, on the other hand, flat out messed with its target. Hence, it became much less difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Taking that theory and applying it to the skills in my possession allowed me to realize that it'd probably be hard for people to sense Appraisal or the Principle of Falsehood. Skill Taker, on the other hand, seemed like it’d be pretty easy to notice immediately.</p>
<p>「I doubt Presence Detection would allow you to detect if you're being appraised, even if raised to its maximum level, but leveling the skill to level 8 should at least be enough for it to let you to detect if someone uses a skill that'll have an effect on you.」</p>
<p>In other words, level 8 probably wouldn’t cut it for us. Self Evolution allowed us to get skills much more quickly than the average person, but it also came back to bite us in the ass by not providing us with any of the experience typically involved in leveling it. Luckily, it looked like the eastern dungeon would allow us an opportunity to overcome our shortcomings. In either case, it seemed like our goal was set. We’d dive into the dungeon and level Presence Detection up to 8 either through absorbing magic stones or using self evolution points.</p>
<p>「Leaving now.」</p>
<p>「’Kay, see you around. Oh, and please don’t forget about the Klimut thing!」</p>
<p>Fran turned her back on Dias as he begged her for a favour and departed from his office.</p>
<p>『Let’s go check out the library and see if we can gather ourselves some information about the dungeon.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『We don’t have that much time to spare, so we'd best get all this administrative stuff over with as quickly as possible.』</p>
<p>We needed to find ourselves a place to stay before nightfall. That, however, was honestly not my first priority. I had something else on my mind, something much more important than just finding an inn.</p>
<p>『You think Old Man Gallus is here yet?』</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>And so, two hours passed. We had long stopped looking around the library and instead started walking around the city in search of Gallus. He should’ve arrived way before we did, especially after taking into consideration the fact that we'd gotten ourselves a little bit more than a little bit sidetracked.</p>
<p>The reason we were searching for him, and not verification of the fact that he was here was because it was pretty obvious that he'd at least been here rather recently. Many of Ulmutt’s adventurers were like the ones in Alessa in the sense that they were walking around with high quality weapons made from iron or steel.</p>
<p>We had started out by asking a few of these adventurers for confirmation, and it turned out that our guesses had hit the nail right on the head. Their weapons were indeed made by the old man, but that was where our smooth sailing came to an end, as they'd all pointed us in different directions when we asked them for his location. It seemed like Gallus had been going around the city borrowing other blacksmith’s forges in order to make his goods as opposed to staying in one place like he did back in Alessa.</p>
<p>Fran and I ended up having no choice but to visit random weapon stores in order to hopefully run into him whilst also listening in on the adventurers in our vicinity along the way. Much to our annoyance, it seemed that most were talking about topics relating to dungeons or the upcoming martial arts tournament. We didn’t hear anything about Gallus at all. That said, we did happen to stumble across a group of three adventurers discussing something that just so happened to catch our attention.</p>
<p>「Hey, you hear about the evil god’s fortress? Apparently it fell overnight. Wasn’t the Millenia Fortress supposed to be their most fortified stronghold?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, but that’s not the only place in which the evil god’s believers have gathered en masse. The rumours have been saying that some of them are even getting blessed with the evil god’s powers.」</p>
<p>「Wait, wait, that’s a thing? I thought the only people that worshiped the evil god were criminals and outlaws.」</p>
<p>「Apparently, Evil Goblins and Evil Kobolds are only the way they are because they’ve powered up after receiving the Evil God’s blessings, not that I’ve ever seen either of them myself.」</p>
<p>「Oh! Those things? I’ve heard that they’re really hard to deal with. Wait, don’t some countries go all out in order to exterminate the evil god’s believers? Maybe that’s why Millenia fell.」</p>
<p>「Oh come on, you know that the Millenia Fortress is in the Kingdom of Reidos, right? There’s no way the Reidosians would ever bother wiping them out. In fact, it’s far more likely for them to try putting them to use instead.」</p>
<p>「But, if the Reidosians didn’t crush the fortress, who did?」</p>
<p>「Who knows? I’ve caught wind a few rumours saying that it was because they had a falling out. I heard it from one of my acquaintances that happened to be in the area when it happened, and he got his info from one of the underlings that escaped from within the fortress. Apparently one of their top brass happened to get back that day and caused an uproar. It's said that guy had totally transformed, as if born anew. His body became like that of a magic beast’s instead of a human's. He used that new body of his to slay all the other executives before laughing and claiming that he’d consumed them for their power He was like a demon, they say.」</p>
<p>「Dude, that sounds freaky as hell.」</p>
<p>「Were you try to tell us a horror story or something?」</p>
<p>「Come on guys, I was being serious. Though, it was just a rumour I heard, so do admit that it might’ve ended up getting exaggerated.」</p>
<p>I was rather surprised to hear that the Evil God’s believers had a sort of fortress set up, and even more surprised to hear that it’d already fallen at the hands of one of their own allies.</p>

<p>To me, that sounded like Zerrosreed feeding his cannibalism skill no matter how you spun it. Does that mean he’ll end up going around tearing down all the Evil God’s strongholds for his skill’s sake if we just leave him be? I mean, that actually kinda sounds like a plan. We could leave him be till he takes out all the Evil God’s followers and then just kill him off. Only problem is that we don’t really know how strong he’ll end up getting by the time we get to him.</p>
<p>（Growl.）</p>
<p>『You sure sound pumped, Urushi.』</p>
<p>（Will defeat some day.）</p>
<p>『Yeah, we’ll kick his ass. But first, we’ll have to get stronger.』</p>
<p>（Nn.）</p>
<p>（Woof!）</p>
<p>The conversation we overheard was interesting, but it didn’t really give us anything to act on, so we continued walking around town with our ears perked.</p>
<p>We weren't able to find anyone that knew Gallus till we entered our third smithy. Its owner was much like the old man, he was also a dwarven blacksmith.</p>
<p>「Already left Ulmutt?」</p>
<p>「He left a few days ago cause he heard about what happened in Barbra. I'm pretty sure he decided to head over because he figured he’d be able to help.」</p>
<p>Looks like we just missed each other.</p>
<p>「He said he’d be back before the Martial Arts Tournament, so you might catch him if you sit around long enough.」</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>「Y’know, Gallus has actually told me about you ahead of time. So that’s what his custom made named equipment looks like…? Damn, that's fabulous.」</p>
<p>The blacksmith looked at Fran’s black cat armour pieces with his eyes gleaming. I mean, I got that he was looking at the armour, but many of the people that passed by seemed to think him a pervert ogling a little girl.</p>
<p>In fact, most passerbys regarded him like he was some sort of weirdo, and some had even given him a series of harsh glares. I couldn't help but think that they were going to end up reporting him to the authorities, though I hoped they'd refrain.</p>
<p>The dwarven smith, however, completely ignored them all and even continued to do things like touching the mantle and checking the quality and feel of its fabric. Fran herself was rather happy that her equips were being praised, so she stood still and cooperated as he went through with the inspection process.</p>
<p>It took the blacksmith five whole minutes worth of staring and touching before he finally found himself smiling in satisfaction.</p>
<p>「What a sight for sore eyes. Thanks for letting me do that. Feel free to come here if you want your stuff repaired for cheap. I’ll help you get your hands on discounted dungeon supplies too.」</p>
<p>We hadn’t really been concerned about the repairing our stuff, but, the supplies part sounded pretty nice. We might end up needing stuff in order to go dungeon diving and whatnot.</p>
<p>『Oh, right. Let’s ask him if he knows any good inns.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Know good inns?</p>
<p>「You haven’t decided yet? As for me, I think the Cellar Blade Shop’s probably one of my favourite places. The booze they serve there is great.」</p>
<p>Well, that’s a dwarf for you. That sounds good and all, but wouldn’t somewhere with a lot of drunks be all noisy?</p>
<p>「The bar’s in the basement, so it’s too bad as far as noise goes.」</p>
<p>「Got it. Will go check out.」</p>
<p>「Alright, and do come again.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The inn the smith introduced us to was one with thick walls and a rather calm air to it.</p>
<p>We decided to check out the place they had underground, and it turned out to not be nearly as loud as I’d been expecting. It was much more of a bar than a tavern. There was a cafeteria-like area as well, but it wasn’t all that loud there either. The only booze they served was located at the bar, so you couldn't eat and drink at the same time. As a result, there were far fewer people making noise. It looked like the dwarven blacksmith had been right. The noise didn't look like it was going to end up bothering us.</p>
<p>Our room was of a similar standard of quality. The floor was clean, and the bed soft. We were even allowed to let Urushi in in his smaller form, albeit at a bit of an additional cost.</p>
<p>All in all, it seemed like a really nice place.</p>
<p>「Nn. Not bad.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Better yet, it looked like both Fran and Urushi liked it too.</p>
<p>『Okay, that’s done. Any other plans?』</p>
<p>「Dungeon diving.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>They were both just full of energy, which, I guess wasn’t really too bad a thing. We have a bunch of requests and whatnot to handle anyway.</p>
<p>『Alright, but let’s check out all the requests we have first.』</p>
<p>「Right. Forgot.」</p>
<p>We began placing the requests on the bed so we could go through them more easily.</p>
<p>Wait, there’s a tonne here. Is it really okay for us to take all these? I feel like other adventurers would start calling nepotism if they found out how many we were hogging them all to ourselves.</p>
<p>『It looks like it’d probably be better for us not to tell anyone else how many requests we’re handling.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Er, well, I said that, but it turned out that half the requests were subjugation type requests. They were much like the regular goblin ones in the sense that they were perpetually active. That is, they could be completed by any one at any time.</p>
<p>The other half required us to gather materials.</p>
<p>「High Ogre horns, Man Eating Mole claws.」</p>
<p>『I don’t think I’ve ever even heard of any of these magic beasts.』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>『Though, the notes I took in the library say that they can be found starting at the eastern dungeon’s tenth floor.』</p>
<p>「Looking forward.」</p>
<p>All of the requests we got were clearly justified in their classifications as quests for D rankers, as they all needed us to do stuff in places newbies would have to struggle to even get to. It seemed that you weren’t supposed to go past the eastern dungeon’s 9th floor if you were F ranked or lower.</p>
<p>『Let’s see… Phantom Dogs, Darkstalkers. Yeah, it looks like there’s lots of stuff that’ll try sneak attacking us.』</p>
<p>Dias' info had been spot on.</p>
<p>It actually took us quite some time to finish looking through all the requests we got. Fran and Urushi both ended up bored out of their minds. You know, Fran should start learning how to focus on this stuff. Gathering information seems like it’d be a pretty important basic skill for adventurers.</p>
<p>Though, she did manage to spend a whole hour looking through it all, so I guess that is technically a pretty big improvement. She used to start nodding off after just five minutes.</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s go.』</p>
<p>「Wait. Not yet.」</p>
<p>Oh? Is she going to go through all the info again?</p>
<p>「Eat first.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『Oh. Right, yeah. Let’s do that.』</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>TLN: First of three Christmas releases! The other two will be out as soon as they're done.</p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>147. Arriving at the Dungeon<br>
</b><br>
We headed over to the dungeon immediately after eating our fill at the inn’s dining hall.</p>
<p>Neither Fran nor I knew where to go, so we asked one of the lady’s at the inn. The reply we got from her was surprisingly short and simple.</p>
<p><span id="more-672"></span></p>
<p>「The west dungeon’s over near the western stronghold, and the east one’s right beside the eastern stronghold. Just walk in a straight line, you can’t miss either of them.」</p>
<p>It looked like the dungeons were inside the large cylindrical buildings. Rather, it turned out that the buildings had actually only been constructed in order to enclose the dungeons in the first place. [1]</p>
<p>At first, most people had still felt that the dungeon masters were rather untrustworthy. They didn’t actually believe that they would uphold the contracts they made with Dias.</p>
<p>Thus, the Kingdom of Kranzel ended up constructing two large buildings, one around each dungeon. These two constructions were an attempt to minimize the people’s feelings of anxiety. The people would be less concerned about the dungeon masters failing to fulfill their promises so long as they had insurance in the case that it happened. The wall that surrounded the city was also constructed with the same purpose in mind.</p>
<p>That is, the outer wall would be able to contain the dungeons’ monsters even if they managed to break through the strongholds built up in their immediate vicinities. The construction of both these countermeasures managed to settle most of the citizens’ concerns.</p>
<p>That, however, begged a certain question. What did Ulmutt’s citizens think? It was technically possible for the city to end up as a battlefield.</p>
<p>We’d asked for the innkeeper lady’s opinion, and it turned that most of the people that lived here actually felt more positively about the dungeons than anything. The majority of Ulmutt’s citizens either were merchants and adventurers, or had some sort of connection with them. They’d actually only chosen to move to Ulmutt because of its dungeons. They knew the dangers and had long acknowledged them as a part of their daily lives. In fact, the city's people saw the dungeons as their breadwinners and were even concerned with their conservation.</p>
<p>They went as far as to regard the city’s outer walls as a nice added bonus that they just happened to be lucky enough to get from the government, reason being that they hadn’t paid even a cent for it themselves.</p>
<p>All I had to say was… wow. I mean, I should’ve expected it given that the city was frequented by rowdy adventurers and cunning merchants, but damn, the people here got guts.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We did as the innkeeper instructed and made our way towards the eastern stronghold. It didn't take long for us to realize that navigating the city’s streets was as hard as navigating a maze, even with the end goal almost in sight. It’d almost felt whoever built the place had done so without a solid layout planned out ahead of time.</p>
<p>The closer we got to the fortress, the more apparent this became. The buildings themselves started getting older and more historic looking, whereas the streets just flat out degenerated into a huge mess of alleyways and intersections. The older buildings looked to be of a poor quality, as they obviously weren’t built with any sort of construction related principles or standards in mind.</p>
<p>We went up and down stairs, hit dead ends, turned around and did all sorts of wandering before finally reaching the dungeon’s entrance about an hour after we first set out for it.</p>
<p>「Arrived. Here, dungeon?」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>『I’m pretty sure that this is the fortress they built up around the dungeon. We should be able to get ourselves inside if we head over to that gate over there.』</p>
<p>The building looked pretty big up close. I also now realized that the stronghold we were looking at was no normal fortress. It didn’t have windows, and its gate would actually be pretty small if you ignored the part that had been dug out under the ground level. I could see why though. I mean, they called it a fortress, but it was only actually built in order to keep the dungeon in check and whatnot. In other words, its goal was to keep what was inside in as opposed to a regular fortress' goal of keeping what was outside out.</p>
<p>A group of soldiers had taken up residence in the fortress’ upper floors so they could act in times of emergency.</p>
<p>Ten odd adventurers were lined up in front of a small building set up by the fortress’ gate. It looked like they were waiting their turns in order to get themselves admitted to the dungeon.</p>
<p>Fran garnered a bunch of attention as she got in line, but this time around, there wasn't anyone that bothered messing with her.</p>
<p>A fair portion of the adventurers gathered at the gate seemed to be ranked in at D or higher, and most were able to discern that she wasn’t just some weakling. Having Urushi around helped quite a bit too. We’d already had him go back to his actual size, so he looked fairly intimidating.</p>
<p>Even the more mischievous looking adventurers seemed not all that keen on involving themselves with us with our giant ass wolf friend around. Urushi was normally restricted from using this form. He couldn’t parade around town in it, and dungeons were often too narrow for him.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>「Next plea — WHAT THE! That wolf is huge!」</p>
<p>「W-What’s wrong? What’s all this commotion all of a sudden!?」</p>
<p>The person responsible for admissions accidentally screamed when he saw Urushi. The guard hadn’t ended up seeing him ahead of time because he happened to be in the building’s blind spot.</p>
<p>「W-Whoops, s-sorry. I just got a bit surprised is all.」</p>
<p>「Sorry little lady, he’s a bit of an idiot.」</p>
<p>The guards that showed up here were much more pleasant sounding than the ones that we’d met outside the city. They apologized sincerely and whatnot, and more importantly, they didn’t really seem even to bear even the slightest bit of disdain. Their attitudes were so good that they even left Fran in a state of confusion.</p>
<p>「…?」</p>
<p>「Is something the matter?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Complete opposite of guards outside city.」</p>
<p>「I see. Did you run into any sort of complication with them, perhaps?」</p>
<p>「That’d probably be because they sent all the more diligent guys over to Barbra.」</p>
<p>Ulmutt’s soldiers needed to be strong enough to both guard the dungeons and keep unruly adventurers in check. Thus, stronger individuals were often hired even if their attitudes happened to be a bit lacking.</p>
<p>The city had decided to send some of its troops over to Barbra in light of the recent events that had occurred, and it went without saying that sending the more ill-mannered individuals was nothing short of a horrible idea. Hence, Ulmutt’s higher ups had ended up deciding to send over most of their harder workers, the people that normally made up the backbone that supported most of the city’s regular guard-related activities.</p>
<p>As a result, the less well mannered guards usually responsible for rounding up criminals and subjugating magic beasts outside the city’s walls were tasked with helping with maintaining public order. As a result, the town had, in general, gotten a lot less secure. In fact, the guards themselves ended up bringing about a fair amount of trouble.</p>
<p>「The men we sent to Barbra will be returning in due time. The Guildmaster and several other high ranking adventurers are helping us keep everyone in line for the time being, so everything’s still thankfully under control.」</p>
<p>「Still, it'd be best for you to be careful. It was honestly very difficult for us to immediately see you as an adventurer. We wouldn’t have believed you if not for your guild card, and I'm sure there will be others that not only feel the same, but are more stubborn in their ways.」</p>
<p>「I think you’re probably the youngest adventurer to have ever tried entering the eastern dungeon.」</p>
<p>「…And you’re registered. Your guild card should now log the dungeon’s info.」</p>
<p>「Log?」</p>
<p>「It’ll track the floors you’ve visited and number of monsters you’ve defeated. It’ll let you immediately determine whether or not you’ve completed a request.」</p>
<p>Oh, nice, that sounds really convenient. It sounds like it’d make reporting subjugation requests incredibly simple. It’d also prevent people from giving false reports, not that that mattered to us seeing as how we were actually planning to do stuff the legit way anyways.</p>
<p>「Do pay attention to the fact that the east and west dungeons have separate trackers. Nothing done in the eastern dungeon will count towards trackers for the western dungeon and vice versa.」</p>
<p>I guess that means we’d have to register again if we wanted to do stuff in the western dungeon too.</p>
<p>「And here’s your card back.」</p>
<p>「Don’t push yourself too hard.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Thanks.」</p>
<p>Alright! It’s finally dungeon time.</p>
<p>（Let’s go.）</p>
<p>（Woof!）</p>
<p>『Be careful though. The place is supposed to be filled with traps.』</p>
<p>（Nn. Got it.）</p>
<p>You know, now that I think about it, this is actually our first time entering a more difficult dungeon all on our own. It’d be best for us to be prudent.</p>
<p>Having Fran die by falling in some random trap without any real warning would totally suck, so I’d really prefer for that not to happen.</p>
<p>『Urushi, don’t warn us about any traps unless we’re about to get totally screwed. We won't be able to get much training done if you do.』</p>
<p>（Ruff.）</p>
<p>The door opened as one of the guards did something with an item he happened to be holding. There seemed to be a weird flow to the magic in the door's vicinity, so he'd probably just used some sort of magic item.</p>
<p>We caught sight of a small shrine-like thing situated in the centre of a stone dome the moment we went through the gate.</p>
<p>『Is that the dungeon’s entrance?』</p>
<p>「Small.」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>Looking a bit closer, I noticed that the shrine’s entrance contained flight stairs that ultimately led deeper underground. Still, the dungeon’s entrance sure seemed small for how famous it was, but that didn’t mean we’d be letting our guards down. A dungeon was a dungeon, after all.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>[1] This wasn’t all that clear in earlier chapters, but turns out there are two cylindrical buildings. Japanese rarely involves the specification of plurality, I unfortunately had no way of knowing whether there were one or multiple ahead of time.</p>

		<p><b>148. Disarming Traps<br>
</b></p>
<p>「Just remembered. Thought Master would refuse.」</p>
<p>『Refuse what?』</p>
<p>「C rank promotion, because will stand out.」</p>
<p><span id="more-682"></span></p>
<p>『Well, I guess you’re right, but I figured there wasn’t much point to it anymore. I mean, you want to participate in the martial arts tournament, right?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『Yeah. Participating will make you stand out pretty much right away anyways.』</p>
<p>「Right. Will stand out if achieve victory.」</p>
<p>『Haha. Yeah, basically.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We descended the dungeon’s stairs as we chatted. Naturally, we didn’t relax our guards while doing so.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for us to arrive at the first floor’s entrance, a long, narrow passage constructed entirely of stone. It was far too short and thin for Urushi, so he had no choice but to return to his smaller size.</p>
<p>「Urushi. Training to fight while small.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>We didn’t need to light any torches or provide any other sources of light. Luminescent moss grew on the cave’s ceiling and provided the passage with a dim glow. It didn’t illuminate every last nook and cranny, but, was still good enough for our purposes.</p>
<p>『Looks like we’ve already hit a crossroads, and one that diverges into three different paths, at that.』</p>
<p>「Go down which?」</p>
<p>『Hmmm, well the rule says you should always go left.』</p>
<p>The rule I was referencing was the so left hand rule. It stated that you’d be able to find a path out of basically anything so long as you had your left hand against the wall and always turned left. I mean, it technically did work with your right hand as well, but yeah.</p>
<p>Naturally, the left hand rule wasn’t actually perfect and didn’t actually apply to every given situation. For example, it didn’t work if the place we were trying to get to required us to traverse a hidden room. It also failed to apply when the place we were trying to reach was the centre as opposed to an exit, when there weren’t any walls, and when we had move up and down stairs and ladders and stuff in 3D space.</p>
<p>Oh, and just to put this out there, we looked up all sorts of stuff so we could successfully complete our magic-beast related requests, but we didn’t actually spend any time looking at the dungeon’s layout, nor did we look for information pertaining to the traps within it. We figured that kind of info wouldn’t actually really help us given that we were trying to train ourselves in the art of detection. The whole point was for us to locate traps and magic beasts on our own, without any extra help.</p>
<p>「Then will choose left.」</p>
<p>I guess that works. I’m not really sensing any traps or magic beasts from any of the three paths right now anyways.</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s go.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We popped our detection skills and began walking down the leftmost path.</p>
<p>「Mmph.」</p>
<p>『Oh?』</p>
<p>Fran and I simultaneously detected something around three minutes after we started moving.</p>
<p>「Detected.」</p>
<p>『So you managed to pick it up too, Fran? It looks like a Shadow Snake to me.』</p>
<p>「Over there.」</p>
<p>A single black snake was hidden away in a dark corner that the luminescent moss’ light failed to reach. It was quite difficult to notice, and almost seemed as if it was blending into the shadows. Its name made me think it could use dark magic, but it couldn’t. It was instead something that stemmed from how it it slithered around in the darkness.</p>
<p>「Weakling.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>『Yeah. It is kind of the first thing we’ve run into though.』</p>
<p>It was about the same size as a Japanese rat snake, and had basically no offensive prowess whatsoever. Shadow Slip and Presence Detection skills aside, it was basically just a normal snake. Honestly, it would probably never be able to harm you so long as you just wore yourself a pair of boots.</p>
<p>To be frank, it was a magic beast that the average adventurer wouldn’t even bother hunting. It tasted like garbage, its magic stone was worthless, and it basically didn’t give any exp at all. To make matters worse, you actually had to go through its corpse and extract its magic stone too, a procedure that took much more time than it was worth. That said, we weren’t normal adventurers. I saw no reason to pass up a chance to potentially level up a skill while also getting free magic stone points.</p>
<p>And so, Fran murdered the Shadow Snake. It only ended up giving me a single magic stone point, but hey, one step at a time, right?</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s keep going.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Time passed as we advanced.</p>
<p>Fran completely froze after we got a bit deeper into the dungeon.</p>
<p>『What’s wrong?』</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>「Trap…?」</p>
<p>『Really? Where?』</p>
<p>「Floor. There.」</p>
<p>『Ohhhh. I see it now.』</p>
<p>Looking at the place Fran had pointed to made me feel a sense of discomfort, as if something was just the slightest bit out of place. Activating Trap Detection and staring at the area with a more discerning eye allowed me to understand that the trap I was looking at was one would activate in response to weight. Specifically, activating it would release an arrow.</p>
<p>Fran seemed to have noticed the trap before me as a result the Sole Sense skill, a skill that allowed her to detect oddities through the soles of her feet. It was really quite useful, as Fran could sense the vibrations she produced while walking while walking around, thereby allowing her to derive quite a bit of information.</p>
<p>It was a skill I wouldn’t get any use out of unless I was dragged along the floor or walls, but that’d produce way too much noise for comfort, so yeah no.</p>
<p>『You want to try disarming it?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Disarming traps was honestly pretty much my speciality due to my access to telekinesis. I could get rid of their mechanisms without much effort, and if I messed up, I could just choose to set them off from afar from without putting at us risk. That said though, we figured it’d be a good idea for Fran to get used to doing it herself as well.</p>
<p>『Good luck then.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran pulled out the toolkit we got back at the Adventurer’s Guild. In it, she found a pair of tweezers and a thin blade. Both items were said to be necessities for adventurers with scout-type jobs.</p>
<p>The toolkit also included instructions on how one would go about disarming traps, and went over several different principles. The method Fran was trying now was specifically one that made the trap harmless instead of just flat out obliterating it. That is, she would figure out how it worked before destroying one of the key mechanisms that rendered it operational as opposed to just messing the whole thing up.</p>
<p>The trap that the two of us were looking at right now was activated through a weight trigger. That is, applying weight to the area it which it was set would lower it, thereby pulling a wire which in turn would release an arrow from a hole in the wall to our left. As far as I could tell, there were two ways to disarm the trap. The first was to plug the hole, and the second was to carefully cut the wire.</p>
<p>Fran ended up deciding to go with the latter of the two options, and thrust the blade she got from the toolkit into a thin gap in floor that lay between the activation tile and the rest of the cave.</p>
<p>We were still only on the first floor, so the trap was still a relatively simple one that didn’t take much effort to disarm. The arrow was positioned so that it’d only hit people that were standing, so we honestly could’ve just crouched and had Fran press the tile in order to disarm the trap by setting it off had we been any lazier.</p>
<p>In fact, we didn’t even actually need to disarm it. We could’ve just avoided the activation tile and been done with it, but we decided to go through with the entire procedure because we figured it was a good chance for Fran to get some practice in.</p>
<p>「…Done.」</p>
<p>『Yup, looks like you did it.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>The dungeon had the ability to repair itself, so the trap would end up getting rearming in a few hours time. In other words, we won’t be able to piggyback off other adventurers. All the traps they disarmed would be back to normal by the time we reached them.</p>
<p>「Let’s look for next trap.」</p>
<p>Apparently, Fran had enjoyed disarming the trap. She was scanning the area for more with an entertained expression on her face.</p>
<p>『Er, sure. But I think we’ll have go dive a bit deeper first if you want to find any.』</p>
<p>Why do I feel like she might end up wanting to choose a scout-related job for her next job change? Crap, what if she actually does, and stops wanting to be a swordsman?</p>
<p>「Trap found. Want to disarm. Okay?」</p>
<p>『S-Sure, go for it.』</p>
<p>Everything’ll work out just fine, right…?</p>
<p>『Is disarming traps really that fun?』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran’s eyes gleamed as she approached a hole in the wall. The way she stood in front of it with her arms crossed and her expression all serious almost made it seem like she was giving off the aura of a trap craftsman.</p>
<p>Is she this entertained because she finds traps to be like puzzles or something?</p>
<p>『I guess we’ll keep watch over our surroundings…』</p>
<p>「Woof…」</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>That's all for now. Merry Christmas, happy holidays. I'll try cramming a few more releases between now and the new year. Peace.</p>

		<p><b>149. An In-Dungeon Encounter<br>
</b><br>
We were steadily grinding our way through the dungeon.</p>
<p>The first floor’s traps were simple, and its magic beasts weak. Hence, we’d managed to reach the stairs leading to the dungeon’s second floor whilst remaining completely unscathed.</p>
<p><span id="more-687"></span></p>
<p>「Hurry to second floor.」</p>
<p>『The first floor kinda had this whole like testing ground-like feel.』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>I mean, we were careful and all that, but holy crap that first floor was way too easy.</p>
<p>『Let’s keep going till things start getting a bit too difficult.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Welp, onto the second floor we go.</p>
<p>We descended the stairs while keeping an eye on our surroundings, only to find a scene that could be described as relatively familiar.</p>
<p>That is, Fran, Urushi and I found ourselves in a small room with three paths splitting off of it.</p>
<p>「Keep left?」</p>
<p>『Sure, why not?』</p>
<p>I mean, we didn’t really know anything about this place, and it wasn’t like we could make a more informed decision or anything, so whatever works works.</p>
<p>And so, just like that, we managed to breeze our way through the dungeon’s first 4 floors without even the slightest bit of trouble from any of the traps or magic beasts we ran into along the way.</p>
<p>We didn’t run into any other adventurers either. The first couple floors didn’t seem to have anything that’d provide an adventurer with any real sort of income, so most people probably just followed a map and dove straight down the shortest route or something.</p>
<p>Making our way through the dungeon without a map and disarming all the traps we ran into along the way filled us with a sense of idle curiosity.</p>
<p>The fifth floor was a slight bit different to the four that preceded it.</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>『…』</p>
<p>Namely, it’s traps were a tad bit more difficult to deal with; it took Fran quite a bit more time to disarm them. As a result, traversing the fifth floor ended up taking about as much time as the third and fourth put together.</p>
<p>「Master, trap.」</p>
<p>『Man, putting a trap right in front of the stairs leading to the next floor is one hell of a dick move.』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>『And it’s a pretty difficult one to disarm too.』</p>
<p>I checked out its inner workings by using echolocation, and turned out it was actually fairly complex. That said though, its complexity only ended up pumping Fran up the more.</p>
<p>「Will do best.」</p>
<p>And so, Fran started tinkering with the trap with a serious look on her face. She remained quiet throughout the process, hence causing the dungeon to be dead silent save for the trap’s metallic clanking and the occasional breath.</p>
<p>Both Urushi and I quietly stood by and watched over her as she went about taking the thing apart.</p>
<p>She and I both let out a bit of a noise about five minutes after she first got to work.</p>
<p>「Oh.」</p>
<p>『Welp.』</p>
<p>Three arrows flew out from the ceiling, their tips aimed straight at Urushi’s back.</p>
<p>「Whimper!」</p>
<p>『Are you alright, boy?』</p>
<p>「Wooof….」</p>
<p>It looked like he somehow managed to dodge them in time. Well, hopefully he learns his lesson, and stays on guard from now on even if we’re not actually having any sort of trouble.</p>
<p>「Sorry. Made mistake.」</p>
<p>It looked like she cut the wrong wire.</p>
<p>『It looks like it’s much harder to deal with than the all the earlier ones. It might be a bit hard for you to disarm with it unless you get a job that enhances your ability to mess with traps.』</p>
<p>「Will disarm next one. Without fail.」</p>
<p>『Sure. I don’t really see any issue with us going at it a few extra times.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Attempting to disarm more complex traps is probably a pretty good way to train up the Disarm Trap skill anyways.</p>
<p>『You stay motivated too, Urushi.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Alright, let’s go down those stairs.</p>
<p>『Looks like the sixth floor starts off pretty much the same way as the others before it did.』</p>
<p>「Three paths. Still left?」</p>
<p>It ended up turning out that the only part of the layout that actually remained the same was the first.</p>
<p>The sixth floor’s traps were much more difficult to disarm, and we only managed to successfully get four out of five.</p>
<p>They’d also become much more deadly. The arrows were coated in poison, there was a bunch more smoke, and the pitfalls were made twice as deep. I mean, they weren’t so bad that they’d cause instant death, but they were definitely deep enough to cause quite a few serious injuries.</p>
<p>The magic beasts ended up getting a good bit stronger too.</p>
<p>「Haaah!」</p>
<p>『Fire Javelin!』</p>
<p>「Growl!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>『Nice!』</p>
<p>The battles functioned as yet another form of practice. That is, Fran was using them in order to better her sword drawing techniques.</p>
<p>We faced off against assassin slimes and chameleon lizards, just to name a few. The first of the two mentioned would crawl out of cracks in the dungeon’s walls in order to assault us, whereas the second would attempt to blend in with the walls themselves. All the magic beasts we met were like them, the cunning little bastards refused to play fair and kept trying to pull fast ones on us. Worst of all was the fact that most of them were ridiculously difficult to notice.</p>
<p>Yeah, I could totally see why training here would let you grind up your detection-based skills real quick.</p>
<p>That said though, they were still far from being our match. They were probably E ranked threats at best, so they didn’t end up managing to put any damage on us either. Honestly, I felt like the traps were more difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>『The magic beasts should get stronger if we dive a bit deeper, but they honestly don’t amount to much right now…』</p>

        </div>
        
<p>I mean, it was still our first day here, so I didn’t really see any issue with us just sitting around and practicing stuff for a bit. We might end up having quite a bit of trouble detecting some of the stuff on the lower floors, so yeah.</p>
<p>Well, we might as well keep going for now. We can figure out whether we want to keep going or not when we actually do start running into the more difficult to deal with magic beasts.</p>
<p>Only after clearing the sixth floor did we meet our first adventurer.</p>
<p>A half dead, bloodied young man was sitting on the dungeon’s with his back leaning against one of its walls. A second, older man lay beside him, but unlike the first, the second had already breathed his last. Though, the first did look like he’d soon do the same if we just left him there.</p>
<p>It seemed he had the Appraisal Blocking skill, as I couldn’t actually appraise him at all, so the only thing I could do was go off his looks, which informed me he was some sort of beastkin. I didn't really see any reason not to help him. There were three of us here, so we could easily just dispatch him if he turned out to be some sort of villain.</p>
<p>『Greater Heal』</p>
<p>「…What…. just….?」</p>
<p>「Still alive?」</p>
<p>「Did… you just help… me?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I see, thanks. W-Wait, was there anyone else, or was it just me here?」</p>
<p>「One more. Didn’t make it.」</p>
<p>「Wha!? L-Leader!! Why did it have to come to this…?」</p>
<p>The beastkin boy began to cry as he clung to the corpse of the man he called his leader.</p>
<p>「Uuu….」</p>
<p>Fran immediately raised me and pointed me towards him. Her actions were merciless but also absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>「No evidence you didn’t kill him.」</p>
<p>There was always the possibility that the boy was just acting, and that he was a thief that’d traded fatal blows with the now-dead man. I mean, he looked like his feelings were genuine, but we couldn’t appraise him, so we couldn’t let our guard down.</p>
<p>「So you’re an adventurer too? You're… so much more amazing than me.」</p>
<p>「Give answer.」</p>
<p>「I don’t know how I can make you possibly believe me, but he and I really were friends…」</p>
<p>『He isn’t lying.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>「You’ll believe me?」</p>
<p>「Can tell is truth by looking.」</p>
<p>The boy seemed relieved despite the fact that we’d just totally flat out bullshitted him; he breathed a sigh as he unsteadily rose to his feet.</p>
<p>「Thank you.」</p>
<p>「…What happened?」</p>
<p>I kind of pity him, but I felt it was important for us to figure out exactly what happened.</p>
<p>The boy responded to Fran’s inquiries and slowly began filling us in on everything. The party he’d been a part of had been composed of four F rankers, an E ranker, and a D ranker.</p>
<p>They’d finished collecting all the materials they’d sought out to, and were on their way back.</p>
<p>「But we were suddenly attacked.」</p>
<p>「Magic beast?」</p>
<p>「Humans. Magic beasts wouldn’t be able to wipe out a party of six even if they did get the jump on them, not on this floor. The people that attacked us were evil adventurers, thieves.」</p>
<p>Yeah, I figured there’d be people who did stuff like that.</p>
<p>The boy's party had heard rumours of adventurers acting as thieves. They were also aware that the guild had even stated that bringing those guilty of the act would be rewarded. Hence, the boy’s party had been all gung ho about eliminating them, but they ultimately ended up finding themselves outmatched.</p>
<p>「They used traps to get rid of two of us right off the bat, then killed another two of our other members in the surprise attack that followed. There were still two of us left afterwards, but we weren’t able to do anything against the three thieves we were against. Leader had somehow managed to use a Teleportation Feather by mustering up the last of his strength. The two of us should’ve been able to teleport out…」</p>
<p>「Just you and leader here.」</p>
<p>「I see…」</p>
<p>「Attackers, what kind of people?」</p>
<p>「Their faces were masked, and their equipment didn’t really have any distinguishing features… so the only thing I know is that they were a group of four, and that they were all men.」</p>
<p>Hmm… what do? I mean, we could just have Solas, the boy, head towards the exit on his own, but he’d probably die if left all by himself. We kinda went out of our way to save him, so I don’t really want to just let him roll over and die after the fact.</p>
<p>In the end, we decided to accompany him back to town. I mean, a pretty fair distance for just a single day’s worth of adventuring anyways, so yeah.</p>
<p>「I’m sorry for causing you so much trouble.」</p>
<p>「Helping those in trouble, normal.」</p>
<p>「Thanks. I’d like to bring Leader with us too. I don’t want to let the dungeon absorb him if possible.」</p>
<p>The corpses of any humans and magic beasts would end up getting absorbed by the dungeon after about a day. This is only preventable by either taking the corpse outside the dungeon or dismantling it.</p>
<p>Soras was planning to carry the corpse out on his own, but that’d take way too long.</p>
<p>We might as well help him carry the leader guy out, even if we just leave the rest of his companions as is</p>
<p>There was no way for us to get the rest of his companions out, but I guess we might as well carry the Leader guy for him.</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>「Huh? What just…」</p>
<p>「Dimensional storage.」</p>
<p>「Oh! That’s amazing! I don’t think I’ve ever seen it before!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Go.」</p>
<p>「Ah, yeah, wait up!」</p>
<p>And so, Fran started climbing back up the stairs with Leader’s corpse in tow.</p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>150. Attackers<br>
</b><br>
We led Solas back to surface by retracing the path we took on our way down. We had healed him, but he was still missing quite a bit of blood so I figured his pace would be a rather slow one. Contrary to my expectations, however, he was still moving along fairly steadily regardless.</p>
<p><span id="more-691"></span></p>
<p>I’d honestly just kinda ended up assuming that he was an F ranker because he said his party was comprised of D, E and F ranked adventurers, but he seemed to at least be as good as an E ranker.</p>
<p>「Hey Fran, are you using some sort of detection type skill? It sure seems like it. I’ve only got Presence Detection myself.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Solas seemed to be the boisterous type. He more or less kept talking and wouldn’t shut up despite the fact that all Fran really ever did in response to his rambling was nod.</p>
<p>We were able to progress up through the dungeon fairly quickly due to the fact that the traps we disarmed had yet to be restored. I wasn't sure if everything would stay disarmed long enough for us to break through the fifth and sixth floors, but I sure hoped that would end up being the case, as the traps therein were more difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>Two men appeared in front of us as we continued to make our way towards the exit.</p>
<p>「Hey there.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Hi.」</p>
<p>「Huh…? Are you two by yourselves?」</p>
<p>「That’s impossible. They’re just kids. There’s no way two kids would be able to make it this deep by themselves.」</p>
<p>「R-Right, good point. So where’s your party at?」</p>
<p>Both men seemed rather surprised that Fran and Solas appeared to be travelling alone. I couldn't really blame them. They were really quite justified if one was to take the norm into account. That said though, they soon regained their calm after asking us a few questions.</p>
<p>「So you two really are all by yourselves?」</p>
<p>「And you’re adventurers?」</p>
<p>「Is that wolf your familiar?」</p>
<p>「Feel free to stick with us for a bit if you got separated from the rest of your party members.」</p>
<p>「Hey, that’s not a bad idea!」</p>
<p>「Right? Come on, let’s go.」</p>
<p>They seemed like good guys that were concerned about Fran and Solas…</p>
<p>Not.</p>
<p>A quick appraisal immediately informed me that they were about as villainous as could be.</p>
<p>They not only had the theft, torture, threaten, and deceptions skills, but were also marked with titles claiming them to be murderers.</p>
<p>My immediate guess was that their strategy was to approach other adventurers in an amicable manner and attack them the moment they let their guards down. You would normally think that dungeon cards could totally be used to prove that one had killed another adventurer seeing as how it logged stuff, but that wasn't the case. They only recorded monster kills and couldn’t be used to prove whether or not one was commiting crime within the dungeon’s confines.</p>
<p>I felt another person sneak up behind us as I contemplated whether these guys were the same group that attacked Solas’ party — not that that it really mattered. In either case, they were enemies we had to defeat, and that was that.</p>
<p>『Be careful Fran, these guys are thieves.』</p>
<p>（Nn.）</p>
<p>（Woof?）</p>
<p>『What’s the matter, boy?』</p>
<p>（Woof woof?）</p>
<p>Apparently, he was questioning why I'd used appraisal, given that Dias had literally just warned us to be more prudent in its use.</p>
<p>He had a point, but I quickly justified to him my actions. That is, Dias' warnings more so pertained to cases involving royalty, namely in public situations. He also basically more or less explained that other people would also sometimes get mad when appraised because it was seen as a breach of etiquette in general. One of his other key points was that using it under certain circumstances could also get you caught up some sort of ploy or conspiracy if you weren’t careful.</p>
<p>Dungeons, however, detailed a whole different scenario. You couldn’t really not use Appraisal in dungeon-based settings seeing as how it was pretty common for one to run into idiots like these guys. If anything, using it was more natural than not. You’d really need to be a special type of stupid to unconditionally trust someone you just met, especially if that someone happened to have a weapon.</p>
<p>The only thing you could get out of calling breach of etiquette under such a circumstance would honestly be suspicion. It is possible for something unfortunate to come out of using indiscriminately Appraisal even in a dungeon, but that’d only happen if the other party happened to have some super rare skill that happened to damage those that tried to appraise them. Even then, I'd honestly say that appraising them would probably still be worth the risk.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>I wouldn’t mind being on the receiving end either. That is, I’d think it fair and not complain if someone wanted to appraise us in order to trust us if we happened to meet them in the middle of a dungeon.</p>
<p>『That’s just how it is, so don’t worry about it.』</p>
<p>I finished explaining my thoughts to Urushi right about when the men began getting impatient at the fact that Fran had remained silent.</p>
<p>「So? Where yo party at?」</p>
<p>One of the men began talking in a rougher tone, as if he couldn’t keep his act up any longer.</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>『Fran, try leaving one of them alive if you can. Preferably whichever one seems to be in charge.』</p>
<p>（The rest?）</p>
<p>『It’d be too much of a pain in the ass to take them all back into the city with just us here, so you can just cut them up if you want.』</p>
<p>（Nn. Got it.）</p>
<p>『Their stats aren’t too low, so be careful. Urushi, you be in charge of guarding Solas.』</p>
<p>（Growl!）</p>
<p>Though even with that said, I honestly couldn't shirk off the possibility that these men weren’t the same group that had attacked Solas. They could’ve just been former villains that had already been rehabilitated into upstanding citizens. The chance of such a scenario was incredibly small, but there nonetheless, so I honestly hoped for them to make the first move to just in order to confirm that they really were villains.</p>
<p>Fortunately, their next actions almost seemed to function as a response to that hope of mine; one of the men lost his patience and began attacking us.</p>
<p>「Ugh, whatever, enough of this shit already.」</p>
<p>The person who spoke seemed to be a leader, and his words some sort of signal. The man that’d been sneaking up behind Fran immediately drew his a dagger and dashed towards her at an incredible speed.</p>
<p>Although the attacker was just a thief, I had to admit that he wasn’t all that bad at combat. Specifically, I felt that he deserved praise for remaining cautious. He didn't let his guard down around Fran despite her being a young girl, he remained vigilant and tried to deliver a blow that would hinder any future actions as opposed to one that would slay her in one strike. In other words, he didn't fully commit himself to the engagement and tried to make sure that he'd be able to withdraw if he wasn't able to accomplish his objective.</p>
<p>『He's a careful one, but not nearly careful enough.』</p>
<p>「What!?」</p>
<p>I stopped the man’s dagger in place, and sliced his neck open with wind magic before he was able to recover from the shock of his arm suddenly losing all its momentum and freezing in place.</p>
<p>「Huh!? What!?」</p>
<p>Solas was left completely bamboozled as the situation continued to rapidly change.</p>
<p>「Daz!」</p>
<p>「Guah!」</p>
<p>Fran sliced one of the men into pieces, and sent the other flying by batting him with the flat of my blade.</p>
<p>「Gruaaahh!」</p>
<p>The man that got sent flying had so much momentum that he ended up cracking the wall he was smashed against. His arms and ribs both looked like that’d immediately been broken. His spine looked like it'd seen much better days as well.</p>
<p>「Why…」</p>
<p>「Too obvious.」</p>
<p>「Fuck’n… ‘ell…」</p>
<p>The man responded to Fran with a frustrated groan before finally losing consciousness.</p>
<p>（Master, what now?）</p>
<p>『Let’s head back into the city for now so we can hand the guy we just captured off to the guild. You get rewarded for turning him in, remember? We can probably get him to tell us who he’s working with while we're at it.』</p>
<p>Solas approached the man while we were figuring what to do with him and immediately swung his sword without even the slightest shred of hesitation.</p>
<p>His action and Fran’s response to it caused a metallic clang to ring through the dungeon’s corridors.</p>
<p>The man we painstakingly refrained from killing would’ve ended up six feet under had Fran not used me to stop Solas’ strike.</p>
<p>「Explain?」</p>
<p>「S-Sorry, seeing him again just made me want to…」</p>
<p>It turned out that these guys really were the ones that’d attacked Solas and his party. He ultimately ended up lowering his sword, but continued to fiercely glare at the scumbag we had just captured regardless.</p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>151. Skill Related Suspicion</b></p>
<p>We started moving back towards the city immediately after eliminating the thieves that’d attacked us.</p>
<p>Solas had asked to let him take up the lead, to which we raised no objections.</p>
<p><span id="more-707"></span></p>
<p>It felt like a much better idea to keep him as far away from our captive as possible, just in case he felt like murdering him again. Apparently, the men had still been holding onto the items they stole from Solas’ party, so we retrieved them and stuffed them inside of Solas' Item Box.</p>
<p>We’d been unable to discern his skills because he had Appraisal Blocking, but it turned out that he was a scout-like kinda guy. He’d occasionally find traps and move to avoid them.</p>
<p>That said though, it didn’t seem like he was skilled enough to notice and avoid all of them.</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>「Urushi?」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>An arrow shot out of the ceiling and made its way towards Urushi, but the large wolf had managed to grab the projectile with his mouth before it hit him. Dat reaction speed though.</p>
<p>「Okay?」</p>
<p>「Growl!」</p>
<p>「S-Sorry, my bad.」</p>
<p>Solas immediately apologized for missing the trap. I couldn’t blame him though. He was in a bit of a rush, so he seemed less on guard than he otherwise would have been. Plus, it’s not like we pick up on every single trap either.</p>
<p>Hmmmmm… Though, for some odd reason, I felt a sudden sense of discomfort, as if something was out of place… It was almost like a jolt of electricity had run through my brain — not that I actually had one in the first place.</p>
<p>『Hmmm….』</p>
<p>（Master? Something wrong?）</p>
<p>『I’m not quite sure how to put it, but… I feel like something’s not right.』</p>
<p>（Nn?）</p>
<p>『Like, do you feel like anything’s just a bit off?』</p>
<p>（Hm?）</p>
<p>『What about you, Urushi?』</p>
<p>（Woof?）</p>
<p>Was I just imagining things?</p>
<p>「I’m really sorry, I just set off another trap.」</p>
<p>Oh! There it is again…</p>
<p>『How about just now?』</p>
<p>（Nn?）</p>
<p>（Woof?）</p>
<p>Neither Fran nor Urushi were able to feel what I was feeling, despite the fact that it was pretty much the same as the feeling I got when I sensed magic beasts and traps and whatnot. Hm… Weird, I don’t get it.</p>
<p>『Oh well, whatever, let’s just keep going.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Um, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Unharmed.」</p>
<p>「Whew, good…」</p>
<p>Solas came to a sudden stop after we advanced a bit further.</p>
<p>Did something happen?</p>
<p>「There’s something over there.」</p>
<p>「Nn? Where?」</p>
<p>「Over there.」</p>
<p>I couldn’t see anything in the direction Solas was pointing. I mean, he wasn't wrong though. My senses were telling me that there was some sort of trap there, but I couldn’t figure out what it was. That odd sensation of something being off was back too.</p>
<p>「It’s literally right there. You know what, come on, let’s go check it out.」</p>
<p>Huh… It just happened again. Yeah, alright. I’m definitely not imagining it.</p>
<p>That said though, I wasn’t given any time to figure out why I’d been feeling it to begin with, as Solas had immediately dashed forwards without waiting for Fran to first respond to him. Four small holes opened up around us and immediately began to emit a sort of mist. There was one above, one under, and one on either side.</p>
<p>The mist was something that our skills rendered completely invalid: poisonous gas.</p>
<p>「Ah! My bad!」</p>
<p>It looked like Solas had accidentally stepped on trap’s activation switch. Seriously, holy crap, why is he messing up this much? Like, even given the current circumstances, he really shouldn’t be.</p>
<p>「A-Are you okay?」</p>
<p>We couldn’t actually see him because of all the poison that got emitted, but we could still hear his voice.</p>
<p>And along with said voice once again came that odd sense of incongruity.</p>
<p>It seemed like it was something I’d feel whenever he spoke. Wait, could it be that this is what Dias described as the odd sensation you’d get when someone used a skill on you? Wait, that’d have to mean that Solas was using some kind of skill…</p>

        </div>
        
<p>On us.</p>
<p>Doubts began flooding my mind the moment I came to that realization, as if they’d broken through and burst out of a dam.</p>
<p>At first, he said that he was attacked by 3 people, but he later went on to say that there were 4 thieves. At the time, I’d ignored it because I thought to be an honest mistake, but it looked like I messed up. I trusted someone I just met despite not being able to appraise them. Why the hell?</p>
<p>He’d also said that the men that attacked him were masked, but he managed to recognize them immediately. Like, how? That just flat out didn’t make sense.</p>
<p>I also don’t understand how I didn’t catch the fact that him asking us questions nonstop was actually just him probing our skills and whatnot.</p>
<p>He kept activating traps, and even tried to kill the man we captured to top it all off. Like holy crap, he’s suspicious as all hell.</p>
<p>The only reason I trusted him was because the Principle of Falsehood hadn’t told me that he was lying, because he technically wasn’t.</p>
<p>An incredibly powerful sense of discomfort assaulted me, one much greater than all the others I’d felt before it. Why had we treated someone that we’d met less than an hour ago like a companion? And as it if it was natural too.</p>
<p>The answer to that question was one that I simply could not explain. My guess was that Solas had done something to us, but I couldn’t figure out what, and also still couldn’t help but have the sneaking suspicion that I was wrong about this whole thing.</p>
<p>Solas was definitely suspicious, but we had no solid evidence that he was the one behind all this…</p>
<p>『Fran, don’t respond to him.』</p>
<p>（?）</p>
<p>『Just do as I’m about to tell you.』</p>
<p>Fran followed my instructions and took a knee. Likewise, we had Urushi “collapse” on the ground. Naturally, the two were both just acting.</p>
<p>If Solas really was what I thought he was , then he'd probably try something — not that he’d actually be able to harm us. I could activate Telekinesis literally instantly, and I’d already cast Chronos Clock, a Dimensional Magic spell, on both Fran and Urushi. The spell allowed the two to interpret Solas’ actions in slow motion, and thus retaliate should he try something.</p>
<p>Chronos Clock's biggest disadvantage was the fact that his words would get slowed down as well, so they wouldn’t be able to figure out what he was saying, hence why I didn’t cast the spell on myself as well.</p>
<p>「Did you just you use some sort of magic…?」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>「Fran? Are you okay?」</p>
<p>It seemed he sensed that we’d cast a spell. I guess casting Chronos Clock wasn’t exactly the best idea, but better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>「Ugh…」</p>
<p>「Hmm, so you used some sort of magic, but weren’t able to prevent yourself from being poisoned?」</p>
<p>「Uu.」</p>
<p>Fran was showing off her acting skills by pretending to be in pain.</p>
<p>「It looks like you really have been poisoned. Don’t worry, I’ll help you make it so it doesn't hurt anymore.」</p>
<p>He still wasn’t lying, but his actions served to contract his words. That is, he’d drawn the blade at his waist and swung it in Fran’s direction.</p>
<p>Actually, thinking about it, what he said was cliché, but it wasn’t wrong. Killing someone was indeed a way to prevent them from feeling any further pain.</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「What!? How!? That shouldn’t be possible!」</p>
<p>「Fmmph!」</p>
<p>「Guahhh!」</p>
<p>Fran easily dodged his blade, drew me, and performed a pair of slashes. The first removed his right hand from the wrist down, and seperated him from his sword. The second caused him to part with his right leg.</p>
<p>「W-What…」</p>
<p>Solas, who’d collapsed, looked up at us with an expression filled but with shock.</p>
<p>There wasn’t any way for Fran to converse with him while she was still under the effects of Chronos Clock, so I undid the spell and let her talk.</p>
<p>「First. Deactivate Appraisal Blocking.」</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Happy New Years everyone!</p>

		<p><b>152. Solas<br>
</b><br>
We quickly threw a heal at Solas, who was still collapsed on the ground and unable to rise to his feet. He lost both an arm and a leg; his injuries were far too serious for a single heal to fix, but we didn't really care. All we needed was for him to stop bleeding so we could question him.</p>
<p><span id="more-715"></span></p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>His expression remained constant throughout the process. That is, he simply continued to glare in Fran’s direction.</p>
<p>「First. Deactivate Appraisal Blocking.」</p>
<p>「What?」</p>
<p>「Playing dumb. Pointless.」</p>
<p>「…I see. You must have Appraisal then.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「And what if I say no?」</p>
<p>His expression was filled with a sort of strength, one that left me confused as to whether he was trying to negotiate or just flat out defy us for the sake of it. Either way, we didn’t care. We weren’t planning to really negotiate with him in the first place.</p>
<p>What we needed to do was figure out what the skill he was using on us was.</p>
<p>「Will keep hitting, but won’t kill. Can use healing magic, won’t allow suicide.」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>Fran’s lack of an expression was pretty nice to have at times like this. It made her sound completely serious — not that we weren’t actually completely serious anyways.</p>
<p>Solas seemed to have sensed it, as his eyes had immediately began expressing his fear.</p>
<p>「…You'll at least let me live, right?」</p>
<p>I felt something again the moment he spoke in that probe-like manner. The sensation I felt this time, however, was a bit different than usual. It was much more clear. I could immediately tell that Solas had done something to us.</p>
<p>The sensation was very much akin to having someone stroke the my blade, it was one that was simply impossible for me to ignore.</p>
<p>I was pretty sure that Malice Perception, Crisis Detection, Magic Detection, and Presence Detection were all working in conjunction in order to allow me to sense that he’d used a skill on us.</p>
<p>『Fran, did you feel anything just now?』</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>『What about you, Urushi?』</p>
<p>（Woof?）</p>
<p>Neither of the two could sense anything at all. Why was I the only one capable of picking this up? My immediate guess was that it was probably because I had the Sorcery skill, and that it made me better at picking up on magical energy and the flow thereof. If that is indeed the case, then I guess that just means that I’m just better at picking up magic-related stuff, kinda like how Fran’s better at picking up stuff that involves using the five senses.</p>
<p>（Something done to us?）</p>
<p>『I think so.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran nodded and stabbed me straight through Solas’ back.</p>
<p>「Giiiiiiihhhh!」</p>
<p>It was a well aimed thrust; I went right through his lungs. If Solas were an ordinary person, he probably would’ve died just then. Him being an adventurer only prolonged his pain. The fact that he wasn’t weak disallowed him from even fainting. He was forced to endure an exorbitant amount of pain as blood spewed from his lips.</p>
<p>「Hiiigiiiigigiiiiiihh!」</p>
<p>「Middle Heal」</p>
<p>「Ugh….」</p>
<p>Being healed caused Solas to fall into despair. Only then did he realize just how far she was willing to take this.</p>
<p>「Will not allow any actions until Appraisal Blocking deactivated.」</p>
<p>「Growl.」</p>
<p>「Ha…Ha…」</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell whether it was because he started getting scared, or whether it was just because we’d stabbed him through the lung, but Solas’ breath gotten all ragged. He didn’t bother putting up a front any longer. He hadn't removed his gaze from Fran, but tears had welled up in his eyes.</p>
<p>「I-I get it, I get it! I’ll deactivate the skill. It’s one of my equips, so you’ll have to let me take it off! Give me just a second!」</p>
<p>He brought his hand out in front of him and bit down on his ring in an attempt to take it off. Apparently that was what was stopping us from appraising him.</p>
<p>Oh right, we chopped off his other arm so he can’t really take it off normally, can he?</p>
<p>That said though, it refused to budge, which kinda did make sense. Rings were like that. They’d get stuck if you gained even the slightest bit of weight.</p>
<p>「Haa… mmmphhh….」</p>
<p>However, Fran wasn’t what you’d call the patient type. Seeing him fiddle around with it only served to annoy her.</p>
<p>「Enough.」</p>
<p>「Whagyaaa!!」</p>
<p>Solas lifted his head with a bit of a stupid look on his face in response to her words, only to immediately lose his finger. Fran finished everything up nice and quick by severing it before he had much of a chance to protest against her actions. The boy had naturally let out a scream in pain, but I didn’t really mind it too much. I was more so focused on admiring Fran’s technique. She’d managed to separate him and his finger without causing even the slightest bit of damage elsewhere.</p>
<p>「Heal.」</p>
<p>「Hiii hiii」</p>
<p>The only comment I had was that it was a shame the ring had been broken — not that it was even the slightest bit Fran's fault. It seemed like the ring was the disposable type of equip. It was made to break the moment it was removed. That said though, it was still pretty worthwhile an item seeing as how it prevented people from appraising you and all.</p>

<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Huh, he seemed decently strong, and his skill levels weren't too bad either. In fact, he looked like he could be a C ranker if he wanted.</p>
<p>『He’s got a unique skill, it looks like. Coerced Camaraderie, apparently.』</p>
<p>「Coerced Camaraderie? Effects?」</p>
<p>「Err… that, right, yeah, that! I’ll answer you, so lower your sword and have your wolf back off a bit already!」</p>
<p>「Growl.」</p>
<p>Okay, he seriously needs to just get to the point. We don’t have time to listen to him rabble on and on forever.</p>
<p>「It’s just a boring little skill that’ll make people think of me as a friend or comrade. It lowers the target’s guard and makes them less doubtful of what I do. It’s nothing special. I can’t use it to make people treat me like their best friends or lovers.」</p>
<p>Ah, so that’s it. That’s why we didn’t suspect him, or rather, that’s why we thought we were just imagining the fact that he was acting suspiciously.</p>
<p>「It’s a skill that’ll undo its effects the moment you happen to have any strong doubts.」</p>
<p>「Used skill to infiltrate adventurer parties and attack companions?」</p>
<p>「Pretty much.」</p>
<p>I figured that was the case. My guess was that he’s been popping traps and whatnot on people here for quite some time already.</p>
<p>「Any other companions?」</p>
<p>「None. Just the people you killed.」</p>
<p>『That’s a lie right there.』</p>
<p>「Lies. How many total?」</p>
<p>Fran pointed me right at Solas’ face.</p>
<p>「Do you… happen to have a skill that detects lies too?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Man, I was being extra cautious of that too…」</p>
<p>Ah, I see, I see. He had Appraisal Blocking and Coerced Camaraderie. He’d be able to basically come off clean so long as he stayed vigilant of any lie detecting skills.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, he was always speaking kinda ambiguously. His answers, for the most part, could’ve been taken both ways. They’d technically be right regardless of how we interpreted them. Moreover, Coerced Camaraderie would do to most people what it did to us, and make it so that said ambiguous answers were regarded as ones that affirmed his innocence.</p>
<p>The Principle of Falsehood was honestly a pretty useful skill, but we couldn't really be relying on it all the time. We needed to be more careful about the manner in which we asked questions, else risk having this, or something like this, happen again. Learning that here and now was honestly one huge gain on our part.</p>
<p>「Two choices. Answer honestly now. Answer honestly after torture.」</p>
<p>「I have four other subordinates!」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>I’m glad he was all honest and what not, but… seriously? He was the guy leading all the thieves this whole time?</p>
<p>「Where?」</p>
<p>「…They should be at the guild.」</p>
<p>Solas’ role was to find targets for the rest of his teams. He’d usually go after parties on the rise, people who were earning a fair amount of cash and acting all gung ho about it. Very few would be suspicious of parties like that suddenly going missing seeing as how they usually had the tendency to act rather recklessly.</p>
<p>He’d reach out about once a month, and even then, his lackies wouldn’t actually act every single time. They were cautious and did their best to ensure that there wouldn’t be any rumours about how the parties Solas joined would vanish.</p>
<p>Alright, I guess we’ll have Solas take us to the rest of his companions. Gotta take out the trash and whatnot, you know?</p>
<p>『Hmmm, you see, we’ve got a bit of a problem. He knows a lot about our skills and stuff. I’m not sure letting him go free is that good of an idea. He might go around telling other people about us. What do you think we should do?』</p>
<p>（Kill.）</p>
<p>『Hmm… I mean, I guess that works, but….』</p>
<p>We would be able to get a good amount of info out of his lackies, but there’s probably some stuff that only he, as their boss, knows as well. You know, like where he stores his loot and stuff.</p>
<p>『Actually, hold up. Don’t kill him just yet. There’s something I want to try.』</p>
<p>We should be fine so long as we stop him from leaking anything about us.</p>
<p>「Won’t inflict any more pain if taken to their location.」</p>
<p>「Alright, I got it…」</p>
<p>「But only on one condition. Will form contract.」</p>
<p>「Contract? You can use contract magic?」</p>
<p>「Can’t say anything about us. Leaking information means death. Must agree to contract terms.」</p>
<p>「I’ll take it!」</p>
<p>Yeah, I figured he’d say that. He’d die if he didn’t, soooo, yeah.</p>
<p>「Then will create contract.」</p>

		<p><b>153. Erza Is Willing<br>
</b></p>
<p>We had a pretty easy time getting back up to the surface.</p>
<p>Solas had spent the rest of the trip wrapped up in some of my threads and strapped to Urushi’s back. We only healed him to the point of necessity; we closed his wounds and stopped him from bleeding anymore, but that was pretty much it.</p>
<p><span id="more-723"></span></p>
<p>Fran had also stripped him of all his armour and even covered his face with a cloth in order to make sure that his companions wouldn’t be able to recognize him on sight. He'd already told us everything we wanted to know, so we’d also gagged him in order to prevent him from speaking. We figured that we might as well bring him all the way over to the guild. It was impossible for anyone to tell that the person we had bagged was Solas, but we kinda just sorta really stood out anyways.</p>
<p>「O-Oi oi, did something happen?」</p>
<p>「Was it serious?」</p>
<p>「Sure looks it. I wonder if everything's alright.」</p>
<p>「Looks like someone’s gotten themselves a pretty serious injury.」</p>
<p>The gazes of the people around us immediately locked on to us the moment we left the dungeon. The guards had began rushing our way as well.</p>
<p>Welp, it doesn’t look like we’d be able to get out of this by making any sort of excuse, so I guess we’ll have to tell the truth. That said though, we still wanted to keep attention to a minimum in order to prevent Solas’ lackies from getting away.</p>
<p>「Got attacked during return trip.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>The people around us immediately started to make a fuss the moment Fran informed the soldiers of our circumstances.</p>
<p>「She did <i>that</i> to the person that attacked her?」</p>
<p>「Man, she’s merciless.」</p>
<p>I feel like we gave the people around us a bit more of a scare than we should’ve, though I guess it can’t really be helped seeing as how our wolf companion was kinda dragging a person with severed limbs around like a piece of luggage. The fact that we’d hidden his face away didn’t really help our case much either.</p>
<p>You know, now that I think about it, the way we’re going about this has a bit of a homicidal kinda feel to it, so I can kinda see why people are getting freaked out.</p>
<p>「Oh, you were attacked by thieves?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Nice job there! Both you and your doggy did hella good.」</p>
<p>That said though, the only people that got freaked out were the general populace’s members. The adventurers and guards actually seemed to view our actions in a favourable light. To them, thieves and the like were vicious criminals whose actions verged on the unforgivable.</p>
<p>I thought that they might end up being rather suspicious of us, but Fran’s outward appearance manage to dissuade those who did and made everyone view us in a bit more favourable a light. They seemed to think that there was no way such a young girl would lie about capturing a thief, especially if she had him in tow. Moreover was the fact that going to the guild would allow verification of our claim’s authenticity. A few soldiers ended up offering to accompany us to that end.</p>
<p>「Are you planning to head back over to the guild?」</p>
<p>「We’ll escort you over if so.」</p>
<p>Them accompanying us was an action that'd kill two birds with one stone; they'd be able to escort and monitor us simultaneously. Honestly, we didn’t mind it at all. In fact, we were happy to have them accompany us, as it’d help save time. It’d make it so we wouldn’t have to stop to explain our circumstances every single time we came across a guard.</p>
<p>We happened to encounter Erza on our way back. He’d ran over because he’d heard something had happened, and was a bit concerned about all the fuss.</p>
<p>He’d initially assumed that Fran had been arrested, and started giving one of the soldiers a really hard time.</p>
<p>「Are you okay, Fran!?」</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Whew, thank god~ Were you afraid?」</p>
<p>「Perfectly fine.」</p>
<p>「Fufufu, you sure are a strong one. So I’m guessing that’s the scummy thief that attacked you?」</p>
<p>「Yup.」</p>
<p>Erza sent a hateful gaze in Solas’ direction. It was one filled with such an an immense amount of rage that it caused its target to tremble despite him not being able to see it.</p>
<p>The raging bisexual lowered his lips to Solas’ ears before whispering a single line.</p>
<p>「How wonderful.」</p>
<p>「Hiii….」</p>
<p>「I would’ve smashed you to bits had you given her even the slightest scratch.」</p>
<p>We decided not to tell Erza about the fact that he’d made us inhale a decent bit of poison. I feel like the he'd go on a total rampage if we did, and we kinda couldn’t have Solas dying on us right here and now since we still needed him to verify if we got the right people when we hunted them down.</p>
<p>Actually, that might not be that much of a problem, if any at all..</p>
<p>『Hey Fran, what do you think of asking Erza to help us round up Solas’ lackies?』</p>
<p>（Nn. Good idea.）</p>
<p>『I mean, there’s a good chance that Erza knows what they look like. He’s pretty damn strong too, so he shouldn’t have any issues on that end of the spectrum. It’d be far more likely to succeed than us dragging Solas around everywhere looking for them too.』</p>
<p>We were attracting a fair bit more attention than I’d initially been suspecting. I wasn’t actually all that keen on heading over to the guild as we were now. It didn’t seem like that great an idea.</p>
<p>It seemed like us meeting Erza here was actually a lucky break on our parts.</p>
<p>「Erza.」</p>
<p>「Sup~ Did you need something?」</p>
<p>「Want favour.」</p>
<p>「Sure, leave it to me!」</p>
<p>「Didn’t tell any details yet.」</p>
<p>「Doesn’t matter, just leave it to me. I’ll do whatever you want me to. What do you need? Want me to help you tap the Guildmaster because he’s pissed you off? Or maybe punish the guards that’ve been bullying you?」</p>
<p>Oh god, was that a joke? Please tell me it was. He looks hella serious, but <i>please</i> tell me it was just the kind of joke homos like to make.</p>
<p>For fucks sake, this guy makes me feel so creeped out that I get the chills despite being a god damn sword!</p>
<p>Fran, however, seemed not to mind even in the slightest. She simply conveyed her request to Erza in her usual indifferent tone.</p>
<p>「Need help capturing this man’s companions.」</p>
<p>「Mhmm~」</p>
<p>Erza’s eyes sparkled like those of a dragon that’d found itself some prey as Fran told her the lackies’ names and features.</p>
<p>「Will leave to you.」</p>
<p>「Ufufu~ I just have to not kill them, right? That’ll take a bit of effort.」</p>
<p>「Nn. No issues so long as reward.」</p>
<p>「Got it. I’ll personally give you a reward if you don’t end up getting one from the guild.」</p>
<p>That uh, no. We didn’t mean that. We just want to take them alive so we can have them tell us where they keep their loot and fess up about all the stuff they’ve done.</p>
<p>「I’ll be off then!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Do best.」</p>
<p>No, Fran, no. Please don’t tell <i>him</i> of all people to do his best. That just won’t turn out right.</p>
<p>「Ufufufufu! Hearing you cheer me on makes my bravery and vigour increase a hundred fold! Of course, the same goes for my love too. I’ll be back soon, I’ll catch them right away!」</p>
<p>The manwoman ran off like a gale before Fran had a chance to tell him to take it easy on Solas’ companions.</p>
<p>『Uh….』</p>
<p>（Master?）</p>
<p>『It’s nothing, don’t worry.』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>I hope he doesn’t mess them up <i>too</i> much. It’d be nice if they were at least still recognizable by the time he was done with them.</p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>154. Reeling Them All In At Once<br>
</b><br>
It took us a fair chunk of time to rush our way over to the guild. We’d already figured out to get between the guild and the dungeon’s entrance, and hence, it normally would have only taken us about 5 minutes to get ourselves all the way over, but we had to keep pace with the guards that’d accompanied us, so it ended up taking a whole 30.</p>
<p><span id="more-729"></span></p>
<p>「We’re… finally here…」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The soldiers that’d accompanied us were panting heavily. It seems we might’ve been moving around just a bit too quickly for them. That said though, our thoughts weren’t really with them. Both Fran and I were instead wondering whether or not Erza had managed to successfully catch all of Solas’ companions.</p>
<p>「Gyaaa!」</p>
<p>「H-Help! Please, help!」</p>
<p>Okay yup, Erza be on a rampage.</p>
<p>「Oh, hey Fran~ Welcome back~」</p>
<p>「Nn. Them?」</p>
<p>「Yup yup they are. We’ve got all the evidence we need, so I’m in the middle of giving them just a little bit of punishment.」</p>
<p>「We’ll tell you whatever you want!」</p>
<p>「I’ll tell you everything I’ve ever done wrong, so please, no more!」</p>
<p>Three men were crouching with their thighs shut closed together. The last was, for some odd reason, collapsed face up with both hands on his ass.</p>
<p>「You naughty little boys were attacking other adventurers in the dungeon, weren’t you?」</p>
<p>「W-We were!」</p>
<p>「So, you have a boss? Someone must be giving you orders, and someone must’ve brought that whole idea up to begin with.」</p>
<p>「W-We do have one.」</p>
<p>「Who?」</p>
<p>「U-Uh, that’s…」</p>
<p>「If we talk, we’ll…」</p>
<p>「Oh? You’re more afraid of him than me? I guess I must need to punish you guys a bit more~」</p>
<p>「Hiiii! Please, no! It’s Solas! Our leader is Solas, an E ranked adventurer!」</p>
<p>「He’s actually much stronger than he seems! He could probably take a D ranker head on if he wanted!」</p>
<p>「He’ll kill us all in just the blink of an eye!」</p>
<p>It seemed that they were absolutely terrified of Solas, though I guess I could see why. He was not only fairly skilled, but also capable of pulling off scummy moves in a calm manner. It seemed that he’d always been the more cautious type of criminal too, so, those that knew of his actions probably thought him to be some ridiculously evil criminal mastermind.</p>
<p>「That won’t happen. He’s already been captured too, right Fran?」</p>
<p>Well then. Looks like Erza had us totally figured out.</p>
<p>The entire guild seemed to turn their gazes in our direction the moment the manwoman called us out.</p>
<p>「Wait, is that supposed to be…?」</p>
<p>「The rumoured D ranker…?」</p>
<p>「A black catkin…?」</p>
<p>「H-How adorable…」</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like most people were looking at us favourably. Their gazes seemed to contain more curiosity, doubt, and lust than anything else.</p>
<p>「Nn. This.」</p>
<p>「Thankies.」</p>
<p>Erza lifted the cloth that covered Solas’ face and caused his companions to start screaming. They were completed blown aback by the shock of seeing the man thathad always ordered them around in such a helpless state.</p>
<p>「T-That’s Solas?」</p>
<p>「D-Do you think Erza got him?」</p>
<p>「Seriously?」</p>
<p>「It was Fran that caught him.」</p>
<p>「Nn. While on way back.」</p>
<p>「She is a D ranker you know? And a really strong one too.」</p>
<p>「Haaah?」</p>
<p>「What’re you saying?」</p>
<p>「There’s no way a little girl like her could’ve caught Solas.」</p>
<p>Eh, I figured this would happen, and I honestly don’t particularly care so long as we get rewarded appropriately.</p>
<p>Erza, however, didn’t seem to be able to find it in him to let them off.</p>
<p>「So you don’t believe me?」</p>
<p>「Hiii!」</p>
<p>「T-That’s not true. That’s definitely not true at all! We totally believe you!」</p>
<p>「Good. Oh, right, why don’t we ask Solas too. Hey Solas, who captured you?」</p>
<p>「F-Fran.」</p>
<p>「See! It’s true.」</p>
<p>「A-Alright.」</p>
<p>Erza puffed his chest up in pride in response to their claims, but it seemed that he was the only one that’d believed the men he'd coerced into agreeing with him. The people around us were still looking rather doubtful of the men’s claims.</p>
<p>「Where to put him?」</p>
<p>「Just wait around a bit. This is a pretty big deal, so the guildmaster should be right on his way.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>「Do you want to do anything while you wait? Do you maybe want to drink some tea?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Hey, you lot. Keep watch over these guys.」</p>
<p>「Sure thing!」</p>
<p>Erza led Fran over to the guild’s bar and left Solas and his underlings to the adventurers that happened to be be present.</p>
<p>I didn’t really think that to be a good idea at first, but it seemed that the adventurers he’d ordered ended up taking his instructions with a surprising amount of sincerity. Though, I guess it does make sense. Erza would probably give them one hell of a harsh punishment if they let them get away and all.</p>
<p>Plus, we were kinda in the adventurer’s guild. It was kinda impossible for them to escape given that there were adventurers all over the place.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A stack of 20 plates of cake formed next to Fran and Erza over the course of about half an hour. The two seemed to be having fun; Fran nodded along as Erza told her about all sorts of things. He was really skilled at conversation, and honestly would be super popular if he was a bit easier on the eyes. That said though, I can’t really say I'm not all that sure which gender he'd be more popular with…</p>

<p>As for Urushi, he was sitting off to the side happily gnawing on a fairly large bone.</p>
<p>「Hey, I heard something happened.」</p>
<p>Only then did Dias finally show up.</p>
<p>「That was really slow of you. Were you up to something?」</p>
<p>「I was on patrol. What about you? You two sure seem to be having fun.」</p>
<p>「Mhmm. We had looots.」</p>
<p>「Oh, right. And he was the one responsible for that whole traitor ruckus?」</p>
<p>Dias seemed all laid back and whatnot, but I really had to give it to him. He was deserving of both his A rank and his Guildmaster title. He had no mercy for those that harmed the guild and its interests; he aimed a ridiculous amount of bloodlust in Solas’ direction as he spoke.</p>
<p>「Hmm, I see, I see. So you’ve been committing quite the number of crimes.」</p>
<p>Did he just read Solas’ mind? I think he did, but he wasn’t using the skill on us, and he had a tonne of other skills that made him more stealthy and difficult to read, so it was pretty much next to impossible for me to tell. I’m going to have to work on my detection and perception type skills if I’m going to want to be able to see through him.</p>
<p>「And you’re the person behind it all?」</p>
<p>「Yuppers he is. His name’s Solas, and it looks like he was doing a pretty good job of hiding his strength up till now.」</p>
<p>「Really? You must be quite skilled given that your name wasn’t one I recognized. You’ve got quite the interesting skill there too.」</p>
<p>The fact that not even Dias knew of him meant that he really did do a pretty good job of keeping himself inconspicuous. He stayed away from all those that were actually strong and preyed on the weak whilst laying low as your everyday harmless dude.</p>
<p>「To him, what’ll happen?」</p>
<p>「Hmm, well, we’re still going to be running investigations for the time being, but, he’ll probably eventually either get put to death or end up as a slave. I’m fairly certain we’ll be choosing the execution option seeing how difficult it is to deal with that skill of his. Turning him into a slave would effectively be the same as just leaving him be. That said though, I can’t speak for the type of execution he’ll get. The two options are either for us to euthanize him or torture him to death. 」</p>
<p>Oh wow, torturing people to death is actually a thing? Really makes me realize how dangerous a world it is out there. That said though, I do agree. He’d probably just manage to get himself released even if he did end up as a slave.</p>
<p>The thieves we caught had muzzles strapped to their faces, so they couldn’t actually speak. They were trying, and making "mmph" noises as a result, but everyone around them just casually ignored them.</p>
<p>Their fates were sealed, and that was that. However, there was a problem. Or rather, something that I thought of as wasteful.</p>
<p>That thing happened to be the fact that Solas’ unique skill was going to go poof. Coerced Camaraderie was an incredibly useful skill. I mean, relying on it too much the way Solas did would probably get us caught, but, it’s something that’d probably be difficult to detect if used sparingly. I mean, the only reason he actually got exposed was because he’d been too confident in his ability to finish us off.</p>
<p>I really did want the skill.</p>
<p>But even with that said, we weren’t going to be able to get it, at least not normally. Skill Taker was going to be on cooldown for another two months, and there was no way he’d be allowed to live that long.</p>
<p>Wait. Right, we have three Anti-Side Effect Potions. I might be able to get Skill Taker to cool down really quickly if I use all three.</p>
<p>「Nn. Works.」</p>
<p>「I’m glad you’re not opposed to the idea.」</p>
<p>「But want to speak to him later. Need to ask something before execution.」</p>
<p>「That’s fine, but, I’d prefer for you to get that done before you finish doing that before the Martial Arts Tournament. There’ll be lots of stuff for me to get ready, so I’m going to be getting fairly busy soon.」</p>
<p>「Then will visit in ten days. Acceptable?」</p>
<p>「Barely, but yes. I’ll talk to a few people and get the necessary arrangements out of the ay.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Oh right, Fran, Erza, the two of you both have the right to claim rewards for the captures you performed. How exactly would you like to sort that out?」</p>
<p>「I don’t need anything since I was just giving Fran a bit of a hand. Do you want want Fran~」</p>
<p>（Master?）</p>
<p>『Well, just take I guess. Erza’d probably be happier if you treated him to a meal or something later instead.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Will gratefully accept. Will treat Erza to food later.」</p>
<p>「Kyaahh! Really!? I’m swwwoooo happy!」</p>
<p>Yup, called it. He responded by screaming in delight and wriggling his body all over.</p>
<p>Alright, that’s that! All that’s left is for us to head back to the inn and test out our Anti-Side Effect Potions.</p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>155. The Terror Wrought by a Guildmaster</b></p>
<p>We went back to the inn immediately after the Guild’s staff took Solas away.</p>
<p>Our goal was to test the Anti-Side Effect Potion and evaluate its effects.</p>
<p><span id="more-739"></span></p>
<p>「Master, how to use?」</p>
<p>『Hmmm… I dunno…』</p>
<p>I’d originally been thinking of creating a doppelganger and having it drink the thing, but that didn’t seem like the best idea as it in no way guaranteed that my main body would also be able to receive the potion effects.</p>
<p>『Let’s try dribbling it all over my blade. Apparently that’s how the Greater Potion of Repair gets applied, so it should work.』</p>
<p>That said though, I wasn’t actually sure whether or not the potion was supposed to have any effect on me to begin with seeing as how I was a sword.</p>
<p>But you know what, whatever. What's the worst that could happen? We waste a few Anti-Side Effect Potions? Yeah, that's no big deal. Screw it, poverty ahoy!</p>
<p>「Ready.」</p>
<p>『Alright, do it whenever. I’m ready too.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran opened a test-tube like bottle and dribbled its contents all over my blade.</p>
<p>I could feel the vivid sensation of the liquid flowing down my body, but nothing seemed to happen, even after a few seconds came to pass.</p>
<p>『Did that not work?』</p>
<p>The moment I doubted the potion was the moment in which it finally showed its effects; it made a “shwing” sound and began seeping its way into my blade.</p>
<p>「Master. Glowing.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>『I guess that means it must've worked?』</p>
<p>I quickly appraised myself to check the potion’s effects.</p>
<p>『Sweet! It did work! Skill Taker’s cooldown got a fair chunk taken off of it!』</p>
<p>Its 57 day cooldown had been cut down to 37 days.</p>
<p>I can now use it a whole 20 days earlier, meaning, I should be able to use the skill right away if we just used the other two pots.</p>
<p>It seemed that Doppelganger Synthesis’ cooldown got completely reset as well. Wait, wait wait, does that mean the potion counteracts all side effects simultaneously? Thinking that, I quickly checked Self Evolution, but it didn’t seem like the magic stones points consumed by Latent Potential Awakening had returned.</p>
<p>It seemed that the potion could do stuff about cooldowns and whatnot, but I guess what was gone was gone. Wait, crap, that means it might not be able to counteract the recoil caused by some skills either.</p>
<p>「Keep going.」</p>
<p>『Hell yeah! Bring it!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran used the second potion and once again caused me to be enveloped by a veil of light.</p>
<p>Except… things didn’t turn out the way we thought they would.</p>
<p>『Huh, that’s weird.』</p>
<p>「Something wrong?」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>『That one only cut the cooldown back down to 30 days.』</p>
<p>Apparently the pot wasn’t consistent. It’d sometimes do more and sometimes do less. Is that due to the fact that each individual potion was of a different quality? Or maybe because of some sort of diminishing returns-type effect?</p>
<p>Hmm, what to do? We might not be able to make the 10 day deadline even if we use our last pot. I mean, we might get it if the third ends up being at least as effective as the first, but…</p>
<p>『Oh well, let’s use it anyways.』</p>
<p>「Sure?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, I am.』</p>
<p>「Then will use third.」</p>
<p>And so, we did.</p>
<p>『We totally failed~』</p>
<p>It seemed that the difference in effects stemmed from the differences in quality between each individual potion. The third was a bit better than the second, but not as good as the first. It took 12 days off the skill’s cooldown.</p>
<p>Skill Taker still had 18 days on its cooldown; we definitely weren’t going to make it in time.</p>
<p>Oh well, whatever. We figured out how the pots worked and cut a fair chunk out of Skill Taker’s cooldown, so it’s still a win in my book.</p>
<p>「Don’t need to steal Coerced Camaraderie.」</p>
<p>『Why’s that? It looks like it could be really convenient.』</p>
<p>「Still, don’t need. Master said Principle of Falsehood required caution, and should not use very often but used lots anyway.」</p>
<p>『Well… okay, yeah…』</p>
<p>「But mostly used to protect me from deception. Can’t be helped because I’m still weak.」</p>
<p>『Fran…』</p>
<p>「Coerced Camaraderie will be same. Will say that it will only be used in times of need, but will use lots anyway. Skills that interfere with people’s minds are scary. Remember… fat noble with Principle of Falsehood.」</p>

        </div>
        
<p>『You mean August Arsand?』</p>
<p>Looked like she totally forgot his name already.</p>
<p>「August, Solas, both were messed up in the head. Most likely because of skill use. Didn’t seem like they could trust people anymore. Don’t want Master to overuse skills and be the same.」</p>
<p>Wow I’m pathetic. I’m supposed to be Fran’s guardian, but this is like the nth time she’s lectured me like this.</p>
<p>『Yeah… you’re right. Good point.』</p>
<p>I’m a weak person. I’d definitely lose to temptation and start using the skill left, right, and everywhere just cause it’d be convenient for me to do so. I’d probably make excuses all the time and try to justify myself too. Skills that can mess with people’s minds are terrifying. It’d be better for me not to have them in the first place.</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s just pretend Coerced Camaraderie never existed to begin with!』</p>
<p>「Nn. Good idea.」</p>
<p>『Let’s check over all the loot we got this time around.』</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>I worked myself up whilst arranging the items we got in order to shake off the awkward mood that’d arose from our previous conversation. Fran hopped right on board and began examining the stuff I laid out.</p>
<p>「This one. Interesting.」</p>
<p>『The knife? Yeah, it’s got a bit of a weird shape to it.』</p>
<p>「Cheap product?」</p>
<p>『Probably, yeah.』</p>
<p>Everything went back to normal; we chatted as we looked over the items we took from Solas.</p>
<p>We were allowed to take all the items Solas and his companions had in their possession, meaning we were also granted rights to the stuff he’d stolen from the adventurers he’d recently murdered. All in all, it was quite a lot of loot.</p>
<p>Naturally, we decided to sell all our materials to the guild and have me absorb all the magic stones despite the fact that they were all of a rather poor quality.</p>
<p>Most of the equips they had were kinda bad, so we decided to get rid of them by pawning them off. Most.</p>
<p>They did happen to have 4 magic items. Two were trash that just gave minor stat boosts, so we completely disregarded them. The other two seemed a slight bit more useful. One was a tent that made it a slight bit harder for the people inside of it to be detected. It looked like something we could get some decent use out of if we decided to camp out in a dungeon or something like that. It wasn’t all that big, but it was roomy enough to fit Fran and Urushi assuming the latter was in his smaller form.</p>
<p>The last item was much more interesting than any of the prior three. It was an equip meant for beast-type familiars. Specifically, it was a claw-like thing that you were supposed to strap to their front paws.</p>
<p>It was made in such a way that it wouldn’t hinder any of the familiar’s regular activities. However, one could have claws extend from it should they charge the item with magic.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Name: Claw of Capture<br>
Attack: 230<br>
Mana Capacity: 100<br>
Durability: 700<br>
Magic Power Conductivity: D+<br>
Skill: Stunning Strike<br>
_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Huh, that’s not bad. The item’s attack stat was kinda low, but it was still better than the nothing he had equipped right now. Plus, that Stunning Strike skill looked like it could put out quite a decent bit of work if used right. It looked like it’d fit right into Urushi’s hit and run style by augmenting his stikes with a negative status condition.</p>
<p>Like honestly, that’s about as good an item as you could expect from a D ranked dungeon.</p>
<p>『Fran, have Urushi equip it.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Urushi, paw.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Right paw first.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Fran quickly strapped the leather gauntlet-like equip onto Urushi’s front feet.</p>
<p>The first thing our wolf companion did after equipping both items was to take an imposing stance. He seemed rather proud and happy. His tail swung back and forth so quickly that it kicked up a gentle breeze.</p>
<p>『That suits you pretty well, Urushi.』</p>
<p>「Looks cool.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>『How does it feel? Did it make walking more difficult? Are the metal parts uncomfortable at all?』</p>
<p>「Bark? Woof woof!」</p>
<p>Looked like everything fit perfectly.</p>
<p>『Alright! Tomorrow, we test it!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>

		<p><b>156. Side Story: Adventurers<br>
<i></i></b><br>
Pathetically Stupid Blue Catkin's POV</p>
<p>This couldn’t be happening.</p>
<p>It simply couldn’t be real. It had to be a nightmare.</p>
<p><span id="more-745"></span></p>
<p>「T-Tarkas? Rawrs? Tordo? T-The hell are you guys doing?」</p>
<p>My three companions had collapsed right in front of me. They were missing all four of their limbs and bleeding themselves out as they cried in pain and despair.</p>
<p>「You bitch! The hell’d y-you do to them!?」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>「You be hella open! Die asshole! Oraahhhh!」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Shit! The hell!? That’s impossible! Let go damn it!」</p>
<p>That’s fuckin’ just not right! The brat just stopped my club with her bare hands!? How the hell!? There’s just no way! My strength matches the average D rankers, but I can’t budge even the slightest bit no matter how hard I try.</p>
<p>「W-What kind of cowardly trick are you tryin’ to pull!? There’s no way someone as great as me could lose to the likes of a god damned black catkin!」</p>
<p>「Fmph.」</p>
<p>「Gah!?」</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell what happened, but both my arms and legs started to burn with a sudden intense pain. Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!</p>
<p>It hurt so bad that I couldn’t help but scream.</p>
<p>And then, I realized it. I’d fallen in much the same way as all my companions.</p>
<p>Just how did this happen? We were drinking and making merry just 10 minutes ago…</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>「Hey, you see that?」</p>
<p>「What?」</p>
<p>「That, over there.」</p>
<p>「Her? Why the hell’s a brat like that in a place like this?」</p>
<p>Tarkas made a gesture with his chin and pointed in a brat’s direction. She was eating all by ‘erself, and you could tell at a glance that she was at too young an age to even drink booze.</p>
<p>This bar be a place where adventurers gather. Brats like her are supposed to get their asses turned away at the entrance.</p>
<p>「Guhehehe, why don’t we make like adults and give ‘er a bit of a warning?」</p>
<p>「Heh heh heh. Adult my ass, you’re getting all giddy about having the chance to make a brat bawl her eyes out.」</p>
<p>Rawrs’ had a huge smile plastered across his face. Looked like Tordo was spot on. He was probably planning to give the kid a “lesson” and then ask for some “tuition.”</p>
<p>He started walking towards the girl, his steps unsteady with drunkeness.</p>
<p>「Hey brat, this ain’t the type of place you should be hangin’ around」</p>
<p>「He’s right ya know? S’only a place for adventurers, not somewhere brats like you should be hanging around.」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>「Oi! Say something goddammit!」</p>
<p>「Respond already ya damned brat.」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>「What? So scared that a cat’s got yer tongue?」</p>
<p>「That’s why you shouldn’t be coming to places like this in the first place. Now scram! Won’t hit you too hard if you do.」</p>
<p>「Kehihihi, think of this as a lesson kid. Not all adults are as nice as us, y’know?」</p>
<p>「But it goes without saying that we’ll still be charging you just a bit of tuition. But don’t worry, we’re not all that bad. You can keep your clothes, but that’s it. Hand over everything else you got.」</p>
<p>「Gyahahahahah! Man, we’re so nice.」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>「Tsk. She ain’t saying a word is she.」</p>
<p>「Hey Tarkas, ain’t she one of them black catkin?」</p>
<p>Oh man, I was so damned drunk I ain’t even noticed the black tail and ears she’s got. No doubt ’bout it, she be a black catkin.</p>
<p>「Geheheheh, you know what? You’re just a measly black catkin, so forget everything I just said. Give us everything you have, including everything you’re wearing.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, yeah, do what he says bitch. You’s just a lowly black, you’re nothing to us blues. Only reason you exist is so that we can prey on you. Black Catkin? More like slave catkin.」</p>
<p>Man, we’re lucky. It’s like we happened across a wallet. It goes without saying that the blackies will always be inferior to us blues, and that to us, they’re nothing but prey.</p>
<p>「Annoying. Shut up.」</p>
<p>「Haaahh? What did you just say?」</p>
<p>「Shut up. Close mouth and disappear.」</p>
<p>Did this fucking slave catkin just talk back to me? A Blue Catkin? The nerves of this bitch. She’s going to fucking pay for this!</p>
<p>「Y-You fucking brat! How dare a black cat like you defy us!?」</p>
<p>「Get on all fours and beg for your fucking life! I’ll only leave you half dead if you do! You ain’t fucking getting away with standing against us, you fucking slave catkin!」</p>
<p>「…Mmph.」</p>
<p>Kukuku, would you look at that. We intimidated her so badly that she can’t even speak no more. She’s fucking shaking in her boots, serves her right! Stupid bitch shouldn’t’ve ‘pposed us from the start! Bitch! That’s what you get for trying to be more than just a slave or wallet! Still though, I’m not going to be forgiving that bitch, not at all. It’s her own fault for disobeying us blue catkin!</p>
<p>Or so I thought, but we were never even given so much as a chance to draw our weapons.</p>
<p>「Blue trash cats. Live rest of lives in regret.」</p>
<p>And then it happened, just moments after the slave catkin spoke.</p>
<p>First was Rawrs. Then Tordo, Tarkas, and finally, me.</p>
<p>「Ugaaahhhh!」</p>
<p>She grabbed the club I swung with the intent to kill and severed all four of my limbs.</p>
<p>「Arrghghhhhhhh!」</p>
<p>Damn it, what’s that noise? Oh, right, it’s come from my very own mouth.</p>
<p>How the hell did it come to this? All we did was mess with a black catkin brat.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>The brat stood in front of me, her eyes filled not with the hatred or bloodlust I’d been expecting, but instead with disgust. She looked at me like she was looking at a filthy roach, or mere trash by the side of the road.</p>
<p>「You said slave catkin twice.」</p>
<p>The brat swung her blade without even the slightest bit of hesitation.</p>
<p>「Gyahhhhh!」</p>
<p>This damned brat cut off my tail!! Argghhhh!!</p>
<p>Why did this have to happen!?</p>
<p><i>Rescued White Dogkin Man’s POV<br>
</i><br>
I continued to gaze at the scene before me, unable to utter even the slightest sound.</p>
<p>It simply seemed unreal. I couldn’t believe it to be something based in reality.</p>
<p>I felt that even the act of recognizing it would lead to it distorting my common sense.</p>
<p>But I simply had to. The sounds that assaulted my eardrums and vibrations that resounded through my body informed me that it was all too real.</p>
<p>「Haaaah!」</p>
<p>「Gugyaaaaooooohhh!」</p>
<p>The young girl’s blade split the last remaining high ogre in half.</p>
<p>「Are… you serious…?」</p>
<p>I unconsciously let out an amazed groan. How was a girl so young completely decimating a whole hoard of D ranked magic beasts in what almost appeared to be a single strike each? I couldn’t help but feel that the phrase "One Hit One Kill" existed for the sole purpose of describing what I’d just bore witness to.</p>
<p>High Ogres were by no means weak. In fact, they were incredibly powerful. They were capable of smashing through a full suit of armour in a single hit. They regenerated ridiculously rapidly, and their skin was so hard that the average blade would find itself simply unable to pierce it.</p>
<p>I knew for a fact that they were strong, especially seeing as how they’d almost killed me just a few minutes back. In fact, I’d already long steeled myself for death, as my sword was unable to inflict them with any wounds whatsoever.</p>
<p>But then she showed up.</p>
<p>When she did, my heart fluttered from despair to hope, and back to despair. I’d realized that the person that came to help me was a mere little girl, a black catkin one at that.</p>
<p>Just think about it, one little girl against a swarm of High Ogres, this dungeon’s most powerful foe. A group of five high ogres was considered a C ranked threat. There was just no way a single girl could win against them. In fact, she was probably going to get totally demolished. I didn’t think she’d even be able to buy me enough time to escape.</p>
<p>But she did.</p>
<p>She killed all 5 High Ogres in just 3 minutes. It took her less time to wipe them out than it would’ve taken me to kill the same number of goblins.</p>
<p>「A black catkin kid…」</p>
<p>I remember hearing a rumour about her as of late.</p>
<p>They said that she was a D ranked adventurer that showed up in Ulmutt rather recently. That in itself was normal, Ulmutt was where all Kranzel’s intermediate-ranked adventurers gathered.</p>
<p>But that was the only normal part about her.</p>
<p>The first abnormal thing about her was that she was extremely young. She was also a member of the weakest beastkin tribe, the black cat tribe, and made it so that everyone that messed with her lost the ability to remain as an adventurer. That wasn’t it either. She was also diving solo as opposed to with a party, and coming out with incredible achievements regardless.</p>
<p>The rumours were totally absurd. I’d assumed that she’d spread them amongst the drunks herself in order to promote her name.</p>
<p>Besides, there was no way for Black Catkin to be anywhere even remotely close to strong in the first place. As a beastkin myself, I thought that to be common sense.</p>
<p>Beastkin were creatures that more or less valued strength over all else. Those that behaved poorly would be forgiven and their actions excused so long as they were strong. In other words, we were the type of creatures that would always lay blame on the weak. Such a trend was deeply rooted in our culture. Black Catkin were thought of as the weakest type of beastkin, and as a result, the ever so douchey Blue Catkin would often sell them into slavery. The fact that they were the lowest in the beastkin hierarchy was exactly that, a fact.</p>
<p>That’s why I simply couldn’t believe that a young, female black catkin could be that much stronger than me. Many other adventurers felt the same. That was why conversations about her were often centered on her tribe rather than her strength or appearance.</p>
<p>「I guess she must be The Black Cat that everyone’s been talking about.」</p>
<p>It looked like the rumours had been based in truth.</p>
<p>The girl that many had started referring to as The Black Cat didn’t bother turning around to face me. It seemed that her saving me had just happened to be a little bit of an extra bonus, and that she’d only been after the High Ogres to begin with.</p>
<p>I myself was also a D ranked adventurer, but seeing her in action had ripped my pride to shreds.</p>
<p>But still, I considered myself lucky. My pride was worth much less to me than my life.</p>
<p>I managed to stay free of injuries and live to see another day. And on top of that, I even managed to learn that The Black Cat’s strength was genuine. I’m glad I learned that here and now rather than at a bar or tavern somewhere. I surely would’ve messed with her had I not known that she was this powerful.</p>
<p>「I better make sure I tell everyone else about this. They’re all just as dumb as I am, so they’ll probably try messing with her if I don’t.」</p>

		<p><b>157. The Old White Dogkin<br>
</b></p>
<p>「Wait Fran! Hold on for just a second!」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>Erza called out to us as we made our way over from the inn to the dungeon.</p>
<p><span id="more-754"></span></p>
<p>He ran towards us with full force, his inner thighs rubbing together and his massive frame jiggling as a result of his movements.</p>
<p>Urushi seemed to feel the same way as me; he was lying down with his tail between his legs. His body language made it seem as if he had simply lost the will to exist because Erza did.</p>
<p>Fran, on the other hand, was able to maintain her composure. Man, she’s got more guts than the two of us combined.</p>
<p>「Erza? Need something?」</p>
<p>「You see, I just so happen to know someone that wants to meet and ask something of you.」</p>
<p>「Wants to meet me?」</p>
<p>「Yuppers! He’s taken an interest in you because of all the stuff he’s heard from all the other adventurers. He really wants to meet the Magic Sword Girl that everyone’s been talking about.」</p>
<p>「What kind of person?」</p>
<p>「Hmmm… well, he’s not a bad guy for sure. He used to be an adventurer, so he’s not the strict type either. He’s effectively the boss of Ulmutt’s beastkin, so it won’t hurt for you to know him.」</p>
<p>Erza’s description made it sound like getting along with the person in question would provide us with a lot of benefits. That said though, we might not actually be able to get along with him.</p>
<p>He might think us to be cheeky. Plus, he’s a beastkin, so the very fact that he wants to meet with Fran seems kinda fishy given that she’s a Black Catkin.</p>
<p>（But introduced by Erza.）</p>
<p>『True. I doubt Erza would introduce you to anyone that’d try to screw with you….』</p>
<p>「I know how you feel. You must be a bit anxious about it, mhmm?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Yeah, in more than one way at that.</p>
<p>「Don’t worry! I’ll be right there with you. I’ll make sure I take responsibility if he tries to take you for a fool.」</p>
<p>What? Just how? God damn, Urushi’s getting all teary eyed. It’s okay boy, he’s not that scary, it’s okay.</p>
<p>「…Okay. Will meet.」</p>
<p>「Thankies! I’ll show you over to him then.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Would you mind if we took a shortcut? I think it’s one you should be able to take without any issues.」</p>
<p>Erza jumped the moment he finished speaking.</p>
<p>Apparently his so called shortcut just involved running atop the building’s roofs. I guess that made sense seeing as how this the city was built like a maze and all that, but was that really okay? Would we not get in trouble?</p>
<p>Er, actually, I guess there wouldn’t really be any complaints, at least not to Erza’s face anyways. Oh well, I guess it saves time, so whatever.</p>
<p>「Nn. No issues.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Knew it~!」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>And so, we found ourselves in front of a fairly large house after 10 odd minutes.</p>
<p>It wasn't as big as the mansions nobles would typically have, but it was still fairly sizeable. Two fairly strong-looking beastkin were standing guard in front of the property's gate.</p>
<p>「Here?」</p>
<p>「Yup. This is Old Man Aurel’s house. Good day, guards.」</p>
<p>「Good day, Erza. It has been quite a long time since we’ve last seen you. Please, do come on in.」</p>
<p>「That I’ll do. Oh, right, I’ve brought a little someone along with me, so don’t worry about her.」</p>
<p>「Sir.」</p>
<p>Wow, Erza showing his face just flat out gets us past security and everything? Damn.</p>
<p>「I’ve done quite a few jobs for the old man, so he’s taken a liking to me and allowed me go in and out as I please.」</p>
<p>「Spacious.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>「He’s a former B ranked adventurer and a successful businessman. He’s even also served at the King’s side.」</p>
<p>Holy crap, Aurel sounds like he’s the spitting image of success. Yeah, he doesn’t really sound like the type that’d get along with Fran. Alright, I should find us an excuse to get us the hell out of there just in case the mood turns sour.</p>
<p>Though, I guess he kinda already has his eyes on us already seeing as how he’s calling us out right now.</p>
<p>Man though, the dude’s garden is absolutely massive. We <i>still</i> hadn't even reached the actual house yet.</p>
<p>The garden was beautiful. It was filled with an assortment of flowers in full bloom and decorated with both fountains and statues. Erza taught us a bit about the flowers’ names as we traversed our way through to the main building.</p>
<p>That said though, neither Fran nor Urushi really seemed to really care about what he was talking about at all.</p>
<p>「Gramps! I’m here!」</p>
<p>「Hello Erza.」</p>
<p>「Hey Shalla, where’s Aurel?」</p>
<p>「He’s currently out relaxing on the terrace.」</p>
<p>「Thankies. This way Fran.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Erza seemed to know the place pretty well. The maid recognized his face, and he'd managed to easily find his way over to his destination without having to stop and ask the maid for directions.</p>
<p>Our destination, the terrace, was on the building’s second floor. It, like the garden, was incredibly vast and expansive. The mansion’s size made it so that the terrace provided us a good view over the city in its entirety. Both Fran and Urushi also seemed rather impressed by the angle we had on Ulmutt.</p>
<p>「Wow.」</p>
<p>「Ruff.」</p>
<p>They both jogged right up to the terrace railing and began looking at the city while completing ignoring the mansion's owner.</p>
<p>「Hahahaha. Looks like the view happens to be to your liking.」</p>
<p>Whew, thank god he wasn’t all anal about manners and stuff. He simply watched over Fran, Urushi, and the pair’s sparkling eyes with a bit of an amused look on his face.</p>
<p>「Nn. Amazing.」</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>「That’s good to hear. I’m Wijaht Aurel, a White Dogkin. Mind telling me your name, little missy?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Black Catkin, Fran. This is Urushi.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Thanks for accepting my invitation. Do have a seat.」</p>
<p>The White Dogkin was like Erza in the sense that he gave off an incredible sense of impact, albeit one of a completely different type; the man gave off the same sort of impression as a Mafia’s Don.</p>
<p>His back was straight, and his gait full of vitality despite the fact that he appeared rather old.</p>
<p>「You really don’t look like someone in their seventies no matter how I look at you. I really would like you to tell me your secret.」</p>
<p>「It isn’t really anything special. I simply kept setting goals for myself and moving forward. I just didn’t give my body any time to age.」</p>
<p>Thank god he isn’t the type of person I was suspecting he might be.</p>
<p>「This tea is quite delicious, it’s one of my favourites, so I do recommend you try some.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「The leaves come from the Continent of Chrome. Collecting tea leaves has in fact been the sole hobby that I’ve picked up in my older years.」</p>
<p>「Garden?」</p>
<p>「I don’t do the gardening myself. I just hire someone and have them do what they think works best. The garden would probably end up some sort of jungle if I was the one in charge of it.」</p>
<p>Fran got down to business while enjoying the refreshments provided.</p>
<p>「Wanted to meet me? Why?」</p>
<p>「Hahaha, you sure are a hasty one. I honestly wasn’t driven to do so by anything in particular. I just happened to feel like meeting you after hearing all the rumours that’ve been going around town lately.」</p>
<p>「As I said earlier, he’s basically the one in charge of all of Ulmutt’s beastkin. He just so happened to be interested in you, Fran.」</p>
<p>「In charge of the city’s beastkin? That’s an exaggeration. I just happen to know most of the people around because I was an adventurer for at least fifty years.」</p>
<p>Is that really it? Does he really not like run an operation from the shadows or something? Okay, you know what, let’s use the Principle of Falsehood and double check. I know Fran totally just warned me about overusing it, but this is one of this scenarios where I kinda have to! Right…?</p>
<p>「I took quite a bit of interest in how terrifyingly strong everybody said you were.」</p>
<p>「So, what do you think? Isn’t she cute? She really is just as strong as they say too.」</p>
<p>「It seems that you’ve taken quite the liking to her. I can see why, it’s been a while since I’ve seen such a bold kid, so I too immediately took a liking to her. Also, I assume the fact that she’s got your approval means that the rumours were true as well.」</p>
<p>Apparently the part about him taking a liking to Fran was the truth.</p>
<p>「Still believe rumours even though I’m a Black Catkin?」</p>
<p>「What, did you think that being a Black Catkin innately made you weak? That’s not true at all. I’ve met a fairly strong one when I was young, and right here in one of Ulmutt’s dungeons at that.」</p>
<p>Aurel spoke in a bit of a nostalgic tone.</p>
<p>「Really? That’s not something I’ve ever been told about.」</p>
<p>「That’d be because I’ve never mentioned it.」</p>
<p>「Where is that person now?」</p>
<p>Fran questioned Aurel in a tone of voice much firmer than her usual one. I could see why though, this was our first time ever hearing about any other strong Black Catkin.</p>
<p>「That… isn’t a question that I know the answer to.」</p>
<p>「Then, what kind of person?」</p>
<p>「Well, it all happened a whole 53 years ago, so I've basically forgotten everything.」</p>
<p>It seemed that he just lied to us… but why? Was it because he died in the dungeon or something?</p>
<p>Aurel’s expression had gone dark. It didn’t seem like he wanted to explore the topic in any more detail.</p>
<p>「I know most of this city’s beastkin, so do tell me if you happen to run into any issues. I’ll be sure to give you a hand.」</p>
<p>The Principle of Falsehood informed me that he really meant what he said, that he’d help us out if need be. You know what, let’s not try digging into that whole other Black Catkin and whatnot. There was no point probing him about the topic, especially seeing as how we seemed to have just won his favour. No point going out of our way to lose it now.</p>
<p>「By the way, I happen to have a request for you. Would you mind taking it?」</p>
<p>「What kind?」</p>
<p>「I’d like you to deliver something to a place not too far from here. You should be able to get it done if you work at Erza’s pace.」</p>
<p>「Can’t just ask Erza?」</p>
<p>「I’d prefer if you took this request. How about it?」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>Fran replied to him immediately. I felt that this whole thing seemed a bit fishy, but Fran seems to think it's okay, so , so I’ll just roll with it.</p>
<p>「Great. Thanks.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Aurel made a bit of a relieved smile. It seemed that he’d really wanted Fran to take his request.</p>
<p>「Alright then. I’d like you to take this to one of my acquaintances.」</p>
<p>「Pendant?」</p>
<p>Aurel handed Fran a plain looking pendant with a black stone embedded inside of it. It looked like the type you were supposed to wear around your neck.</p>
<p>It looked a really cheap item, the kind of thing you could find just about anywhere.</p>
<p>「That it is. Could you hand it over to the eastern dungeon’s Dungeon Master?」</p>
<p>「Dungeon Master?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. Make sure you hand it over personally, okay?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>Hmm, this request’s got a bit of a mysterious air to it. I’m really looking forward to seeing what’ll come out of us doing it.</p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>158. The Mysterious Dungeon Master<br>
</b></p>
<p>（Sorry?）</p>
<p>『What for?』</p>
<p>（Accepted request without asking.）</p>
<p><span id="more-758"></span></p>
<p>『Oh, that? I’ll admit I’m a bit worried about it, but I’m game so long as you are.』</p>
<p>（Nn.）</p>
<p>『Seems like you took a liking to that old man, eh?』</p>
<p>（That old man. Evolved.）</p>
<p>『Seriously?』</p>
<p>（Evolved White Dogkin. White Wolfkin.）</p>
<p>『Didn’t he call himself a White Dogkin though?』</p>
<p>I could swear he introduced himself as “Wijaht Aurel, a White Dogkin.”</p>
<p>（White Dogkin still White Dogkin after evolution. Just White Wolfkin variant.）</p>
<p>『Oh, so that’s how that works? So you’ll still technically be a Black Catkin even after you evolve?』</p>
<p>（Nn. Still some sort of Black Catkin.）</p>
<p>『Man, I’m honestly surprised you noticed though.』</p>
<p>（Can tell because also beastkin.）</p>
<p>『Is that how that works?』</p>
<p>（Nn. That’s how that works.）</p>
<p>Is it cause their instincts, or maybe some sort of racial trait?</p>
<p>（Need to ask about evolution. That’s why accepted request.）</p>
<p>『Ah, I get it. So that’s why.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Hmmm? Did you say something?」</p>
<p>「Nothing.」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>We’d left Aurel’s mansion and headed in the Adventurer’s Guild’s direction. We were still with Erza, and hence, naturally taking one of his shortcuts.</p>
<p>We hopped from roof to roof like a group of bunnies and surprised the crap out of anyone that happened to be in the middle of hanging their laundry.</p>
<p>Our purpose was simple. We were heading over to the Guild in order to formally file Aurel’s request. If we didn’t, it’d kind of end up as something along the lines of a personal favour as opposed to something that went through the guild and got processed.</p>
<p>Apparently, anything that involved delivering something to a Dungeon Master would automatically be qualified as a request of rank D or higher, hence, Erza had recommend that we record it so we could add it to our list of completed requests.</p>
<p>Moreover was the fact that anything that involved meeting a Dungeon Master was actually kind of a big deal. Hence, reporting in and notifying the Guildmaster ahead of time would be in our best interests.</p>
<p>「I’ve never actually been given the chance to meet the Dungeon Masters myself you know?」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>「Mhmm. The Dungeon Masters shut themselves in, so you might not find them even in the dungeon’s deepest depths. The Guild Master is more or less the only person capable of meeting them 100% of the time.」</p>
<p>Well then, it looks like this request of ours is an even bigger deal than I thought.</p>
<p>『Oh well. We kinda accepted it, so let’s put our heads together in order to figure out some way to actually see it through.』</p>
<p>I’ve also gotta think about Aurel’s true intentions as well. Why’d he go out of his way to ask this of Fran in particular?</p>
<p>I guess we should start by looking up some info about the Dungeon Master. The fact that it’s capable of negotiation means that we know for a fact that it’s a member of a race capable of speech, but honestly, that’s about the extent of our knowledge.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We managed to immediately get ourselves a moment of Dias’ time. Meeting the Guildmaster just like that wasn’t something that’d normally happen. Things only went as smoothly as they did because we happened to be in Erza’s company.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>Apparently, Erza wanting to talk to the Guildmaster basically out prioritized everything else.</p>
<p>「Wow~ I’m surprised you’re here.」</p>
<p>「Well, I’m not always out and about. Did you need something?」</p>
<p>「Not exactly. Fran was the one that needed something.」</p>
<p>「Oh?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran quickly told Dias about the request Aurel had given her.</p>
<p>Rather, she started from the fact that the old dogkin had wanted to see her, and accounted everything between that and her receiving the request with particular emphasis on the refreshments she was treated with.</p>
<p>「Ah, so you met Aurel.」</p>
<p>「Acquainted?」</p>
<p>「Well, the city isn’t exactly what you’d call large, so yes, I have. Though, I’m rather surprised to see that he’s given you a request.」</p>
<p>「I can’t figure out Old Man Aurel’s intentions myself. You got any clues, Guildmaster?」</p>
<p>「Hmm… So Aurel too, huh…?」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「Nothing, don’t worry about it. I’ll acknowledge his request, but with it, I’ll also give you a few warnings. First and foremost is the fact that you are absolutely forbidden from harming the Dungeon Master. Harming the Dungeon Master is a crime that's deserving of something much worse than just capital punishment.」</p>
<p>「I know.」</p>
<p>He gave us one helluva harsh warning. It was possible for the Dungeon Master to destroy Ulmutt altogether if we pissed it off. That said though, we weren’t planning to attack it in the first place, so that at least shouldn’t be an issue.</p>
<p>「You should also keep in mind the fact that you may not actually be able to meet the Dungeon Master.」</p>
<p>「Know that too.」</p>
<p>「Good. 」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Another thing is that she’s a bit hard to please. Try not to piss her off if you actually get to meet her.」</p>
<p>「She?」</p>
<p>The Dungeon Master’s a chick?</p>
<p>「Whoops, that’s something you should be looking into yourself, not something I’m supposed to be carelessly telling you.」</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>We tried looking up a few things about the Eastern Dungeon Master a bit later on, but didn’t come up with anything at all.</p>
<p>Everything about the Dungeon Master seemed to have been classified or something. The only pieces of knowledge we ended up having were the fact that she was female and the fact that she was capable of speech.</p>
<p>I figured that we might be able to find ourselves some hints if we looked up stuff about the Western Dungeon Master instead, but that didn’t really end up producing any results either. Again, all we found out was that the Western Dungeon Master was also female.</p>
<p>A part of the lack of knowledge stemmed from the fact that very few had actually made it all the way through to the dungeon’s depths. Even fewer had actually managed to encounter the Dungeon Masters.</p>
<p>『Well, I guess going in blind is basically the only option we’ve got.』</p>
<p>I mean, we were planning to dive into the Eastern Dungeon’s depths anyways, so whatever, I guess.</p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>159. Traps Suck<br>
</b></p>
<p>『Alright, you ready to move on?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Today was our fifth day in Ulmutt. We’d already finished all our business in the dungeon’s simpler subsections, and hence, we’d started digging a bit deeper.</p>
<p><span id="more-762"></span></p>
<p>We were currently hunting magic beasts around where the 14th floor was located. We could’ve gone a bit deeper given the fact that we had to handle Aurel’s request and all that, but we decided to take it slow in order to avoid injury.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Fran was currently in the middle of slowly disarming a trap.</p>
<p>The 14th floor was one of the dungeon’s lower floors, and the traps had been modified to match. They were much more complex than the ones we’d encountered earlier. They were made much nastier too.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is that the traps themselves were full of well, traps. For example, there was a trap composed of a bunch of wires. You’d normally assume that it’d activate if you stepped on something, and that you were supposed to disarm the trap by cutting its wires. However, that one was instead made so that it’d only trigger if you tried messing with it. Another example would be a trap that fired an arrow that activated another trap.</p>
<p>Some traps had also started causing teleportation or instant death upon activation. We also started hitting areas that’d seal off our ability to teleport or use Presence Detection — not that it mattered to me seeing as I had the Unsealable skill.</p>
<p>I mean, I knew that the Guildmaster’s managed to get a few negotiations done and all, but this was still technically a dungeon. It wasn’t some sort of training ground for adventurers. It was the real deal, a place in which one wrong step could lead to death.</p>
<p>「Nn… Done.」</p>
<p>『Really? Lemme see.』</p>
<p>Yup, looks like she disarmed that one perfectly.</p>
<p>Many of the Magic Beasts that thrived in the dungeon’s lower levels had the Trap Detection, Trap Disarm, and Trap Creation skills. The magic beasts themselves weren’t actually all that strong, but they could make for a deadly force when when working in conjunction with the dungeon’s traps. And that, to me, honestly seemed rather logical seeing as how the dungeon itself was pretty much crammed full of traps.</p>
<p>Absorbing said magic beasts’ magic stones meant a fair increase in the respective skills’ levels. Trap Detection had leveled to 7, Trap Disarm to 4, and Trap Creation to 3.</p>
<p>The dungeon’s traps served to provide us with a bunch of practice too. The combination of the skill and practice had led Fran to become much more skillful in the art of disarming traps. The difference between her now and her when she tried disarming her first trap was as clear as the difference between night and day.</p>
<p>Two of the magics we’d obtained from Zerais’ golems, Ice/Snow Magic and Lava Magic, turned out to be rather useful when it came to their applications in disarming traps.</p>
<p>Moonlight Magic, on the other hand, had been stuck sitting on the backburner. The only two spells we had at the moment were Moonphase and Night Vision. The former would provide us buffs at night. The latter would allow us to temporarily see in the dark. Neither was all that useful; we probably wouldn’t be able to get any value out of Moonlight Magic until it leveled itself up a bit.</p>
<p>Ice/Snow Magic allowed us to freeze traps and hamper them from activating. In fact, a single activation of the magic would actually even flat out disarm explosion-type traps altogether.</p>
<p>Lava Magic was actually even more useful than Ice/Snow Magic. We could use it to weld a trap’s subsection and just flat out stop it from activating.</p>
<p>Both Magics had quite the potential for practical use even outside of battle-type situations.</p>
<p>That said though, Fran was still far from being able to disarm every single trap every single time.</p>
<p>「Oops.」</p>
<p>『Short Jump!』</p>
<p>「Whimper!」</p>
<p>Holy crap that was close. We were almost hit by a series of super high speed bullets made of water despite the fact that we’d teleported away. The area of effect was insane. We probably would’ve gotten seriously injured had we not escaped. The bullets were powerful enough to just flat out kill you should they hit your head or some other vital.</p>
<p>「Sorry.」</p>
<p>『Looks like you’re still a bit shy of being able to disarm the traps here perfectly.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Oh well, can’t really be helped. That trap was the kind that wouldn’t let you go any further unless you did something about it.</p>
<p>Aurel’s request aside, we’d set out to do four other things.</p>
<p>The first was to level up. The second was to finish all the quests required for us to rank up. The third was to git gud and learn how to use all our current skills. The fourth and final was to get our hands on a skill that’d prevent us from being suspect to skills that’d mess with our minds.</p>
<p>To be more specific, we were looking for a skill that’d prevent us from being affected by stuff like Coerced Camaraderie and Induced Thought.</p>
<p>Skills like those two only guided our thoughts, and didn’t provide us with any obvious indicators like status conditions, hence why they were especially troublesome to deal with.</p>
<p>We ultimately managed to discover that there actually was a monster with the skill we were looking for here in Ulmutt’s eastern dungeon, but it was one that only resided in the dungeon’s deepest depths.</p>
<p>Dias and Solas both claimed that their skills simply didn’t work on said monster.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>Hence, we were currently giving ourselves a bit of practice while advancing towards our goal: the area at and beyond the dungeon’s 18th floor. Getting there would allow us to finish Aurel’s request too. It was a veritable two birds one stone type situation.</p>
<p>Our pace wasn’t all that bad despite us actively looking for practice. We’d managed to make our way down to the dungeon’s 14th floor after just 2 days worth of adventuring.</p>
<p>Dimensional Storage made it so that we didn’t really have to worry too much about meals, baths, or bedding. More importantly, both Fran and Urushi still looked fairly motivated. In fact, the stronger enemies and more difficult traps were only getting the two even more pumped up.</p>
<p>Several large magic beasts had been standing in the 14th floor’s first notable room.</p>
<p>「Growllll.」</p>
<p>「Master. High Ogres.」</p>
<p>『I guess that means this room won’t have any traps in it then.』</p>
<p>High Ogres, unlike the dungeon’s other monsters, lacked the ability to deal with traps. None were placed in the rooms in which they were placed in order to avoid the possibility of them killing themselves.</p>
<p>They compensated for that weakness through pure power. They generally considered strong enough to give a D ranked adventurers a fairly hard time.</p>
<p>We could just flat out take them head on though, so to us, their spawn zones were more or less safe because they lacked traps.</p>
<p>『Here we go!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Grrrrrrr!」</p>
<p>Our strategy was to wipe them all out in one go with a surprise attack. Fighting them for an extended amount of time was a bad idea, seeing as how other magic beasts could come back them up.</p>
<p>Urushi immediately leapt towards one of the high ogres and readied himself to bite it.</p>
<p>「Growl!」</p>
<p>A barrage of arrows flew straight towards us the moment he tried to take action.</p>
<p>『Holy shit! Air Shield!』</p>
<p>「Ruff?」</p>
<p>I repelled the projectiles with a spell as Urushi panicked and dove straight back into the shadows.</p>
<p>Apparently the room actually did have traps inside of it. I looked towards the high ogres only to find that the arrows had simply bounced off their skin.</p>
<p>Ahhh, I see. Traps like this can work with them because they can’t damage the High Ogres at all. That said, they could prove rather lethal if they hit us.</p>
<p>Man, these traps just keep getting nastier.</p>
<p>『Alright, you know what, let’s just quickly wipe them out. Inferno Burst!』</p>
<p>「Grooowl!」</p>
<p>The flame spell I used turned one of the High Ogres into a lump of coal as Urushi impaled another with a spear constructed of pure darkness.</p>
<p>『Well, so much for High Ogre zones being safe zones…』</p>
<p>「Bring it on.」</p>
<p>Well, I guess at least Fran’s motivated, so there’s that.</p>
<p>『Let’s try being extra careful just in case. It looks like the traps are going to be getting even nastier from here on out.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『You be careful too, Urushi. We’ll need to avoid stuff like what just happened.』</p>
<p>「Whimper…」</p>
<p>We discovered a type of trap we’d never seen before shortly after concluding that we’d do best to be a bit more prudent.</p>
<p>「Weird thread here.」</p>
<p>『Good job catching that. I only barely noticed it myself.』</p>
<p>「Trap?」</p>
<p>The thread Fran and I saw looked identical to the infrared sensors you’d normally see in movies and whatnot. The fact that it was visible meant that it was likely linked to some sort of magic, but I couldn’t tell what would come out of popping it.</p>
<p>「Want to try activating?」</p>
<p>『Sounds like a plan. It’d be a good idea for us to know what happens when you pop it. You know, just for future reference.』</p>
<p>We triggered the trap with one of my doppelgangers after moving a fair ways back.</p>
<p>I heard a bit of an odd rumbling sound the moment my doppelganger stepped into one of the infrared-like lines.</p>
<p>「Master. Walls moving.」</p>
<p>『What?』</p>
<p>It was exactly as Fran described. The walls at the passage’s rear slid along the floor and rearranged themselves. The former straight passageway now ended in a forced right turn.</p>
<p>I see, I see. The trap was on a rather large scale, and honestly, I had no idea how we were supposed to go about disarming. Just looking at it didn’t really provide us many clues; we more or less had no choice but to just give it a shot.</p>
<p>The moment I thought that was the moment the walls started to move again.</p>
<p>「Master?」</p>
<p>『Don't look at me. My Doppelganger’s already gone. Was it maybe cause of Urushi?』</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi frantically shook his head. I guess that means it wasn’t him either. So… who triggered it then? I mean, someone had to, the walls were moving.</p>
<p>My question was answered as the left wall vanished and opened up a passage that revealed a single High Ogre.</p>
<p>『Oh! I get it now! It was the High Ogre that popped the trap!』</p>
<p>It seemed that these traps were the kind that’d trigger regardless of how careful we were. That is, the High Ogres would pretty much just keep setting them off.</p>
<p>Huh, this looks pretty bad. You wouldn’t be able to use a map here even if you had one. The traps would move around, so you’d never really be able to know what was coming at you next.</p>
<p>「Graaahhhhh!」</p>
<p>The ogre caught sight of us as we were thinking about the dungeon’s traps.</p>
<p>『Alright, you know what, let’s just get rid of that first, and then think.』</p>
<p>Man, this dungeon sure is one hell of a pain in the ass to deal with.</p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>160. The 18th Floor<br>
</b></p>
<p>『Looks like we’re finally here.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>We finally reached the the dungeon’s 18th floor, the place that'd let us complete one of our overarching objectives.</p>
<p><span id="more-770"></span></p>
<p>The floors that extended beyond the 14th had given us one hell of an adventure. The number of magic beasts that attacked us multiplied exponentially, and we ended up activating more than 30 different traps as we traversed our way through the dungeon.</p>
<p>The most troublesome Magic Beasts we ran into were vapor-like creature whose species were simply known as “MIST.” They could disperse their bodies and make themselves not only invulnerable to physical attacks, but also entirely undetectable to any that relied on Presence Detection. They even had the ability to activate traps if they chose to condense their bodies down to a smaller size. That in particular was something the MISTs did to us like <i>n</i> times. God, they was annoying as all hell.</p>
<p>Disposing of the MISTs was, in and of itself, rather easy. All we had to do was blast a few AOE spells every time we entered a new area. They kinda couldn’t just stay in hiding if we flooded the entire area with our attacks. They’d more or less get destroyed immediately after two or three repetitions as their specs made it so that they weren't really suited to battle.</p>
<p>In some cases, us firing off AOEs like crazy also allowed us to set off a few traps in advance and save ourselves from having to deal with them.</p>
<p>The only issue with us doing that was that we more or less deprived Fran of a fair portion of her practice. That said though, we were already pretty deep in the dungeon, so I figured it was about time for us to focus on making sure she stayed unhurt instead.</p>
<p>Besides, I figured that it was a much better idea for us to focus our efforts on finding the magic beast that’d give us the skill we wanted anyways.</p>
<p>Specifically, we were looking for Dirty Wisps. They were rare apparitions that looked like black balls of light.</p>
<p>We walked around the 18th floor for quite some time, but we weren’t able to find so much as a single one.</p>
<p>All our efforts ended up doing nothing but providing us exp and magic stones. Fran had leveled all the way up to 43, and I was on the verge of getting myself a rank up as well. Fran was pretty damn close to her level cap, and I was rather curious as to what would happen when she reached it. In fact, I was so curious that I even considered just having her grind out the last little bit on multiple occasions, but I ultimately ended up deciding against it..</p>
<p>『Oh well, I guess it can’t be helped. Dirty Wisps are elusive. If we can’t find them, we can’t find them. Let’s move on.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>『What’s wrong, boy?』</p>
<p>「Growl!」</p>
<p>Urushi suddenly growled and used Dark Magic; he shot a jet black spear straight towards one of the dungeon’s walls.</p>
<p>「Pigiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!」</p>
<p>『Dude, that’s gross.』</p>
<p>A large, purple and orange caterpillar suddenly seemed to phase into existence. It wriggled about as it clung to the dungeon’s wall and barged a strange, black liquid. A similar, putrid smelling substance spilled from the hole Urushi had opened up in the caterpillar’s gut.</p>
<p>『Wait a sec, did I seriously not just notice that thing till it got <i>that </i>close to us? Did you catch it at all, Fran?』</p>
<p>「Also missed.」</p>
<p>「Growl!」</p>
<p>Apparently the thing was called a Mimic Venom Crawler. It seemed to be the type of creature that’d wait for its prey to come to it. This was further evidenced by its skills, as it had Mimicry, Presence Isolation, and Muffled Action. As per its name, the Mimic Venom Crawler’s offenses mostly stemmed from abilities related to poison. That is, it had Poison Fang, Poison Magic, and Poison Spray.</p>
<p>It seemed that Urushi happened to notice it because he’d detected its scent.</p>
<p>The intel we gathered before venturing into the dungeon suggested that Mimic Venom Crawlers were the dungeon's leading cause of casualties, and that adventurers should be as wary of them as possible. In fact, they were even thought of as more of a threat than High Ogres.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve seen them in the flesh, I pretty much came to the same conclusion. They were not only extremely stealthy but also had the ability to fell a man in a single blow by poisoning him. The only ones that could possibly deal with them were those that were highly skilled in detection, and hence, they seemed like they could cause an exorbitant amount of trouble even for adventurers of an intermediate skill level.</p>

</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>On the other hand, the materials you could get from subjugating Mimic Venom Crawlers made hunting them down well worth it. They were extremely useful, and four of the fetch quests we were assigned actually involved grabbing stuff from their corpses. Specifically, we needed their carapaces, their poison sacs, their venomous fangs, and their meat.</p>
<p>I couldn’t really see anyone wanting to eat one of these things, but they were actually considered quite the delicacy. They were said to be like pufferfish in the sense that they were delicious, but could screw you over pretty hard if you didn’t detoxify them properly.</p>
<p>Their magic stones didn’t really give that many points, but absorbing them gave me opportunities to level up Presence Isolation and Poison Magic, so again, hunting them was worth.</p>
<p>Alright Urushi! It’s all you, go go go!</p>
<p>「Urushi. Do your best.」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>Do nose things!</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We spent the next two hours having Urushi, who’d more or less become a professional caterpillar hunter, lead us around.</p>
<p>Our little adventure had taken us all the way to the stairs that led down to the dungeon’s 19th floor.</p>
<p>We had managed to take down a whole 10 of them. Hnnng.</p>
<p>「Master. What now?」</p>
<p>『Well, I mean, we’re already here, so we might as well just move on. Dirty Wisps are supposed to spawn on every floor after the 17th, and we’ve already got all the caterpillar corpses we’ll need, so there’s not really any reason for us to go out of our way just to sit around on the 18th floor.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>And so, we began descending the staircase.</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>『What’s wrong boy?』</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi began barking at something. He seemed to be looking towards the ground.</p>
<p>I honestly couldn’t tell what he was barking at. To me, it looked like he was just making a fuss about the stones paved below us. Only after activating all my detection based skills did I finally manage to notice that there actually was something there.</p>
<p>「Growllll!」</p>
<p>Urushi shot a jet black spear straight towards the floor. Man, what’s with this deja vu? I swear this literally just happened.</p>
<p>「Aaaaaaahhhhh!!!」</p>
<p>The thing that Urushi had attacked screamed and almost seemed to ooze out of the floor in response to his strike. The form it took was like that of an orb giving off a dark light. Its identity was none other than that of the Dirty Wisp that we’d been looking for.</p>

<p>It seemed like the Dirty Wisp had used Dark Magic in order to hide itself in the shadows. Urushi had probably only noticed it because he himself was well versed in Dark Magic.</p>
<p>Man, I swear Urushi’s like perfect for this dungeon. I sure am glad he’s with us. Shit would’ve been terrifying without him; Fran definitely wouldn’t have been able to get this far unscathed.</p>
<p>『Good job Urushi! I’ll treat you to something nice later.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『How’s some super spicy curry sound?』</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>「Mmph. Will also do best.」</p>
<p>Fran took a stance; it seemed that hearing about Urushi’s reward had gotten her all fired up.</p>
<p>『Make sure you don’t let that Dirty Wisp get away.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>The Thought Isolation skill that it had was exactly what we were after. No way in hell we’re leaving without it!</p>
<p>『Urushi, make sure it doesn’t teleport away!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>

		<p><b>161. The Night Fran Hit Level 44<br>
</b></p>
<p>「Hah!」</p>
<p>「Aaahh!」</p>
<p>Fran swung me straight at the Dirty Wisp, but my blade ended up passing through its body.</p>
<p><span id="more-778"></span></p>
<p>It looked like it used Dark Magic in order to defend itself. Specifically, it used a spell that made it momentarily immune to physical attacks.</p>
<p>「Fire Javelin!」</p>
<p>「Aaaahhh!」</p>
<p>『Tsk. Damn this thing’s fast.』</p>
<p>The Dirty Wisp had managed to create a Dark Shield and fend off Fran’s attack. It was not only swift as a coursing river, but also able to cast its spells at an extraordinary speed.</p>
<p>『Fire Arrow.』</p>
<p>『Fire Arrow.』</p>
<p>『Fire Arrow.』</p>
<p>I adapted to the Dirty Wisp’s traits and fired off a larger number of spells in order to make sure it wouldn’t be able to defend itself. I figured that the barrage I shot at it would finally allow us to take it down, but apparently I was in the wrong.</p>
<p>「Aahh!」</p>
<p>『It disappeared…? Wait, no! The damn thing teleported!』</p>
<p>The Dirty Wisp appeared about 3 meters away from its prior location.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like it was capable of teleporting long distances, but still, it was a pain in the ass to deal with. We honestly probably could just spam at it till it died if we wanted, but we might end up breaking its magic stone if we used anything with too much power behind it. Destroying the thing we were after would kinda defeat the whole purpose of us hunting the thing down in the first place.</p>
<p>The issue we were plagued with was one that stemmed from the fact that the Dirty Wisp was actually quite weak. Stronger magic beasts would have harder magic stones, and thus, we could hit them harder without having to worry about smashing their cores to bits.</p>
<p>In that case, the best thing for us to do would be…</p>
<p>『Let’s focus and speed and hit it before it can react.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『Urushi!』</p>
<p>「Woof! Growl!」</p>
<p>『Fire Arrow!』</p>
<p>「Aaahhh!」</p>
<p>The Dirty Wisp dove into the shadows in order to escape our attacks, and, in doing so, danced right to our tune.</p>
<p>Despite being quick as hell, the Dirty Wisp didn’t have access to Chant Shortening, so it wasn’t capable of teleporting in quick succession. In other words, all we needed to do was hit it the moment after it teleported.</p>
<p>We made use of our detection skills in order to predict where it’d teleport to, a feat only made possible through the experiences we gained throughout our exploration of Ulmutt’s eastern dungeon.</p>
<p>「Ha!」</p>
<p>Fran’s right hand flashed as she wreathed me and flame and cleaved straight through the Dirty Wisp.</p>
<p>『Nice!』</p>

</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s keep this up and have ourselves a wisp hunt!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>And so, three hours flew right by.</p>
<p>『Fran, Urushi, dinner’s ready.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>We set up camp in one of the 19th floor’s corners.</p>
<p>The combination of the tent we looted off Solas and the barriers Urushi and I put up practically made our little campsite the dungeon’s safest spot.</p>
<p>We accomplished a lot today. We hunted ourselves some Dirty Wisps, got the skill we wanted, and even grinded Fran all the way up to level 44.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we would finally reach reach the dungeon’s 20th floor and maybe even have Fran hit her max level.</p>
<p>That was all fine and dandy in and of itself, but there was something I had to tell her before she capped.</p>
<p>『Hey, Fran. You got a bit?』</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>『You’re on the verge of hitting level 45.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『Appraisal telling me that level 45 is also your max.』</p>
<p>「I know.」</p>
<p>『So uh… yeah…』</p>
<p>It was a bit hard for me to actually say it, but still, it was better to disappoint her now than later.</p>
<p>Hence, I steeled myself and decided to just be honest.</p>
<p>『I don’t actually think hitting the level cap will let you evolve.』</p>
<p>It was just a prediction, but one I felt I simply had to say to her nonetheless.</p>
<p>I knew that the Black Cat Tribe was weak, but that didn’t necessarily mean that all of its members were just flat out incapable of combat. She can’t have been the only one to have ever hit level 45.</p>
<p>In order words, Black Catkin probably needed to do more than just hit the level cap if they wanted to evolve.</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran simply responded to the concern I voiced by nodding. She didn’t seem particularly upset.</p>
<p>「Same as other beastkin. Satisfied conditions required for evolution. Example, fox tribes’ conditions well known.」</p>
<p>High level foxkin were only able to evolve if they happened to possess Fox Fire, one of the tribe’s inherent skills. Black Catkin also likely had some sort of restriction that would gate from evolution unless they managed to fulfill it.</p>
<p>「Don’t know details, but heard White Wolf also needs special condition.」</p>
<p>『Really?』</p>
<p>「That’s why want to talk with Gramps. Might be able to get hints.」</p>
<p>『So I’m guessing that’s why you accepted his request?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>I really should’ve realized that Fran was thinking more about her evolution than I was. It’d been her goal this whole time.</p>
<p>『Well, alright. All’s well so long as you’re aware.』</p>
<p>「No issues.」</p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>162. The Boss Room<br>
</b></p>
<p>「At dungeon’s deepest part?」</p>
<p>『I think so. The boss should be on the other side of these doors.』</p>
<p>A day had passed since Fran and I discussed the terms of her evolution. And since then, we’d finally reached the dungeon’s 20th floor, its deepest depths.</p>
<p><span id="more-783"></span></p>
<p>In front of us stood a single door. Its intimidating frame stood at a height of almost ten meters. It had a property that made it deflect magical energies, so we couldn’t really discern as to what was in the room it led to.</p>
<p>We could feel a bit of bloodthirst leak through the door, but, that alone wasn’t enough for us to discern the extent of the boss’ strength. All it told us was that the boss was our foe.</p>
<p>「Dungeon Master inside?」</p>
<p>『Probably. My guess is that the answer is yes, but I don’t really have anything to back it up.』</p>
<p>「I see.」</p>
<p>『The info we have on the boss is all over the place, so I honestly can’t even make a good guess as to what we’ll encounter.』</p>
<p>The eastern dungeon was the type that didn’t have a set boss. Apparently, there were about 15 different bosses. The one that ended up appearing would typically be the one that was best suited to combat the challenging party.</p>
<p>Weaker parties would sometimes be pitted against E ranked bosses, monsters even weaker than the High Ogres that one could encounter on the way to the boss room. More powerful parties would sometimes be faced by boss monsters labeled as C ranked threats. In other words, the bosses could be so powerful that they ended up transcending the dungeon’s rank.</p>
<p>Mages have studied the dungeon and come up with a theory to describe the phenomenon. Said theory states that the precise boss that’d spawn was actually based off of the actions the party took as they made their way through the dungeon.</p>
<p>We did gather ourselves a bit of info on the stronger bosses that the dungeon was known to spawn, just in case.</p>
<p>The number of known C ranked possibilities totaled to 3. There was the Tyrant Saber Toothed Tiger that I’d fought in the past, the Smog Hydra, a six headed monster whose smoke would inflict all sorts of different status conditions, and the Specter Lord, a creature that’d summon and make use of the spirits of the dead.</p>
<p>Erza had fought both of the first two species. Amanda had stated that she fought the last back when she herself was a C ranker. In other words, both cases served to evidence that stronger individuals would end up facing off against stronger enemies.</p>
<p>Dias, on the other hand, seemed to be completely exempted from all combat. His face more or less served as a pass that’d let him get through the dungeon without having to face off against a boss.</p>
<p>I’m pretty curious as to the type of boss we’ll end up having to face off against. We could take it easy if the boss turned out to be rather weak or something, but I’d end up feeling a bit miffed cause that’d mean that we were thought to be weak. That said, I’d really prefer if we weren’t forced to face off against something that was <i>too</i> powerful.</p>
<p>Honestly, I was hoping for a D ranked spawn. That sounded like it’d be the most ideal.</p>
<p>That said though, there wasn’t actually any issue in having a more powerful enemy spawn. Ulmutt’s Eastern dungeon was unique in the sense that its boss room didn’t lock you in.</p>
<p>You could make an escape so long as the boss didn’t kill you instantly. Apparently that was one of the terms of the contract Dias and the Dungeon Master had signed.</p>
<p>We’d even be able to just use Dimension Jump to teleport out so long as there weren’t any magic related restrictions in place too.</p>
<p>I planned to immediately test whether or not we actually could teleport out of the boss room. If so, I figured that we could totally just fight whatever was thrown at us regardless of how powerful it is, cause we’d at least have ourselves a life line.</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s do this.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>And so, Fran gave the door a push.</p>
<p>It groaned as it opened and revealed to us the boss room’s contents.</p>
<p>「Ball?」</p>
<p>『Looks like one.』</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>The thing that awaited us was exactly what Fran had described. It was… some sort of ball. Its shape was a bit irregular, so you couldn’t really say that it was a perfect sphere or whatever, but it definitely was some sort of ball nonetheless.</p>
<p>Hmm… how do I put this? The boss looked like it was made out of a bunch of huge turtle shells stitched together to form a ball. It actually kind of resembled a gigantic, black pineapple of sorts. It’s hard exterior looked to be about 20 meters in diameter.</p>
<p>I honestly couldn’t tell what the hell it was based purely on how it looked, but it seemed pretty strong.<br>

<p>Description: A pill bug that’s undergone an abnormal evolution. It’s body is covered in a hard shell. Its wings do not allow flight despite it being an insect-type magic beast. Its main method of attack is to charge at its target whilst relying on the weight of its massive body. It can use Magic Emission to suddenly change directions. It is very difficult to inflict damage upon. It is classified as a C ranked threat despite being roughly as powerful as a B ranked threat in combat.<br>
Magic Stone Location: Heart (Center of Body).<br>
_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>The boss was a top tier C ranked threat, a foe of unquestionable strength.</p>
<p>I was honestly wasn’t really sure as to whether or not we’d actually be able to damage the damned thing. It had a whole tonne of resistances and could even regenerate. Luckily, it wasn’t capable of casting any spells, but honestly, its inability to do so was more or less negligible given how powerful its charge could be.</p>
<p>『Fran! Urushi! Let’s go all out!』</p>
<p>We started off with a preemptive strike. That is, all three of us fired off a spell.</p>
<p>『Inferno Burst!』</p>
<p>「Tornado Lance!」</p>
<p>「Grooowl!」</p>
<p>The pillbug moved at a near unbelievable speed and dodged all three spells in a heartbeat by rolling away.</p>
<p>Even just watching the action filled me with a sense of revulsion. There was no start up or anything like it. The pillbug simply went from being stationary to suddenly moving around at a super high speed. My guess was that it’d used its ability to emit Magical Energy.</p>
<p>This battle was one that was impossible for us to win lest we threw away the presumption that heavy things with massive frames were also slow and clunky.</p>
<p>「Enemy attacking.」</p>
<p>『Dodge it!』</p>
<p>The Magic Beast rolled in our direction as it used its Rush skill. This must be how Indi*na Jones felt when whenever he met himself a giant rock. The large black ball gave off an incredible sense of pressure.</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>『Are you okay, Fran!?』</p>
<p>「Nn… Just a scratch.」</p>
<p>『The fact that it’s damaging you just by giving you a little bit of a scratch is one hell of a problem.』</p>
<p>Its high speed attacks were already capable of causing quite a bit of damage on their own. The fact that it had access to Vibration Strike only served to make it even more deadly. You could end up taking a lot of damage just from having it scrape you.</p>
<p>More importantly was the fact that it had magic resistance. We couldn’t damage it from afar by bombarding it with spells.</p>
<p>『What a pain in the ass!』</p>
<p>「But first powerful enemy in long time.」</p>
<p>『What do you mean?』</p>
<p>「Given chance to become even stronger.」</p>
<p>God damn battle maniac!</p>
<p>But, you know what? I guess that’s in part what makes her so reliable.</p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>163. Disaster Pill Bug</b></p>
<p>A large black ball, the Disaster Pill Bug, rapidly closed in on us.</p>
<p>Its massive body made its attacks incredibly powerful, but that wasn’t all — the bug was extremely mobile. The combination of these two factors made it ridiculously difficult to deal with.</p>
<p><span id="more-832"></span></p>
<p>We’d already experienced the extent of this combination head on several times. We barely managed to dodge the bug’s attacks only to have it suddenly turn on the spot and fly in our direction on several occasions. We would’ve long be squashed if not for our ability to teleport.</p>
<p>One couldn’t even get away from the damn thing by taking to the air, as its Air Jump skill allowed it to chase its prey in all 3 dimensions.</p>
<p>Even more troublesome was the hardness of its shell. Poking at it with anything other than an all out attack would only leave it with a scratch. That would be fine and dandy and allow us to accumulate damage and all, if not for the fact that the insect could regenerate. Its defenses were as solid as Rynford’s.</p>
<p>And if you thought that was all, then boy, you’ve got a whole ‘nother thing coming. The Disaster Pill Bug was capable of throwing a counter with Vibration Strike the moment we tried to attack it. Its detection skills seemed to make it capable of figuring exactly when we were going to strike each and every single time.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like we were going to beat the bug by kiting it and poking at it sporadically. In fact, we were racking up more damage than it was.</p>
<p>But that honestly just made things a lot simpler.</p>
<p>「Nn. Same as usual.」</p>
<p>We just had to do as we always did and finish it off with a single powerful blow.</p>
<p>「Master.」</p>
<p>『Roger.』</p>
<p>Transform was one of the skills I’d used the most in our exploration of Ulmutt’s Eastern Dungeon; I’d practiced it hundreds upon hundreds of times. The Katana form was one of the forms I’d assumed the most, and hence, I was now able to take it in an instant. I’d even become capable of maintaining it for an hour with relative ease.</p>
<p>「Master. Going.」</p>
<p>『Alright! Urushi, lure the boss real quick.』</p>
<p>「Ruff!」</p>
<p>We hid our presences as Urushi provoked the pill bug and got its attention.</p>
<p>The large black ball immediately turned in Urushi’s direction the moment he threw a spell at it. The wolf was in his larger form, but he still looked puny next to the giant pill bug regardless.</p>
<p>「Grooowl!」</p>
<p>Urushi was not only more agile than Fran, but also capable of diving into the shadows if need be, so I was pretty sure that he wouldn’t have any issues if all he needed to do was dodge the pill bug’s attacks. His efficacy as bait was furthered by the fact that his magical strikes allowed him to ensure that the enemy stayed focused on him.</p>
<p>We finished all necessary preparations in a mere few moments.</p>
<p>That said, there wasn’t actually enough space for us to use the thing we used on Rynford. The ceiling was too low; we couldn’t fall far enough to build up all the kinetic energy we needed to make the technique work. I wasn’t too sure how things would end up going, so I didn’t dare pour every last bit of magical energy I had into my blade.</p>
<p>That said, we did have a plan. None of the dodging we did was aimless. We hadn’t just been running away.</p>
<p>Fran waited for the exact moment the pill bug struck a wall and immediately went on the offensive right as it lost all momentum.</p>
<p>She used a combination of my threads and Air Compression to fire herself off in the bug’s direction. That, of course, wasn’t all. She threw both wind and fire magic into the mix to accelerate herself even further. She activated weight manipulation and cloaked my blade in the elements twice over as she drew me from a sheath of compressed air. Every last bit of destructive force she outputted was concentrated on the very tip of my blade.</p>
<p>「Haaah!」</p>
<p>『Nice!』</p>
<p>I’d been pretty sure of our victory, but it looked like I’d been underestimating the Disaster Pill Bug. It was a C ranked threat. C ranked threats were more than just one trick ponies. The bug was capable of much more than mere offense.</p>

</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>The pill bug suddenly used magic emission and caused its body to begin rotating in the slash’s direction, an action that negated a fair portion of the damage that would have otherwise been inflicted.</p>
<p>As a result, her slash only managed to leave a large gash in the magic beast’s shell; its internals remained unharmed.</p>
<p>『Damn!』</p>
<p>「Strong as expected.」</p>
<p>『But we’ve at least made enough progress.』</p>
<p>I mean, it would’ve been nice if we were able to finish him in just one hit, but not doing so was just fine as well. We’d already planned ahead, just in case.</p>
<p>We focused our attentions on the wound that we’d just opened.</p>
<p>『Looks like it worked just the way we thought it would.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Can’t regenerate when frozen.」</p>
<p>Our element of choice hadn’t been the combination of the usual fire and lighting that we’d always loved to use. It’d instead been ice/snow.</p>
<p>The experiments we conducted regarding elemental weaknesses had led us to come to realize that wounds inflicted through ice/snow magic would regenerate at an abnormally slow rate.</p>
<p>We’d created the perfect weakness. All we needed to do now was launch an attack into the crack we made in its shell and we’d be golden. In other words, we secured ourselves a means of attacking the bug’s internals.</p>
<p>「Once more.」</p>
<p>『Let’s finish it off!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>The only problem was that the pill bug would likely rotate in much the same manner as it had earlier. It’d be pretty hard for Fran to attack the exact spot she was aiming for.</p>
<p>『Alright, here’s the plan. We’ll let attack immediately after he finishes one of those spins. It’s gotta take a good amount of force for him to spin like that, and he probably uses a tonne of magical energy every time, so he probably can’t do it in rapid succession.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Urushi, leave to you.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>We kicked ourselves into gear so that we could bring the damned thing down. Urushi started spamming magic at it in order to draw its attention while Fran and I quietly awaited an opening.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for opportunity to knock.</p>
<p>The pill bug emitted a bunch of magical energy in order to hunt down Urushi, but missed and crashed into yet another wall.</p>
<p>Fran immediately leapt at the pillbug, whose open wound just so happened to be facing us. Everything was perfect. All we needed to do was hit the damned thing one more time.</p>
<p>『Let’s do this!』</p>
<p>「Haaaah!」</p>
<p>We launched a second attack with everything we had behind it —</p>
<p>— Only to realize that we hadn’t grasped the full extent of the pill bug’s strength.</p>
<p>I’d thought that the tides of battle were in our favour and that victory would soon be in our grasp. In fact, I hadn’t just thought it. I’d been convinced of it by none other than the Disaster Pill Bug itself.</p>
<p>Shit! How the hell!? I lost to a mere bug in a battle of wits!?</p>
<p>Something burst out from within the bug’s wound the moment Fran was about to slash it.</p>
<p>It lured us in and made sure to attack from a range at which we would be unable to avoid its strike. That said, it seemed that it’d been pushing itself, as its actions had caused its MP to plummet.</p>
<p>「Nraaah!」</p>
<p>『Shittt!』</p>
<p>The insect compressed its magical energy abd launched a projectile from within its broken carapace.</p>
<p>Our eyes were instantly filled with not but a single flash of white.<br>
_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>I’ve got some good(?) news. I’m going to be picking up Nidome No Yuusha in the near future to make up for the fact that I can’t find any good MMOs to play. I’ve spoken with the current translation team. They will be posting one more chapter as it was a sponsored chapter. I will be picking the project up thereafter.</p>
<p>Will this have an effect on TSKD’s release schedule? It will when I’m busy or if I find a new game to play, but otherwise, hopefully not too much. (Note that the schedule will change on Monday regardless because I won’t be on break anymore. It’ll go back to what it was in like September/October.)”</p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>164. Level 45 And Self Evolution Rank 12</b></p>
<p>The burst of magical energy that’d come from within the pill bug’s carapace shattered it and caused its fragments to fly towards us at an incredible speed. The resulting attack that came at us was so fast and destructive that it was almost like that of a shotgun.</p>
<p>I hadn’t realized that the pill bug could use its Magical Emission skill in such rapid succession. It hadn’t done anything like this before despite having crashed into walls. In other words, the damned insect had been holding its trump card in reserve.</p>
<p>We’d been under the effects of Chronos Clock. As a result, everything was moving in slow motion, but the insect’s projectile continued to move at a ridiculously high speed regardless. With the attack’s absurd speed came an incredible amount of power. Even a single fragment of the insect's shell could probably inflict onto Fran a serious chunk of damage.</p>
<p>Shit. I can’t deploy my full powered barriers in time.</p>
<p>I’d already created a set of magical and physical barriers purely out of reflex, but neither had been full forced, and as a result, the pill bug’s attack had shattered them both with ease. The moment I realized that was the moment I played another one of the cards I had on hand. One of our contingencies was for me to use my Telekinetic Catapult. To that end, I’d been saving up a bunch of telekinetic energy. I immediately unleashed every single last bit of in order to form a defensive wall so I could protect Fran. However, there was a problem. I had to cover a rather large area, so I wasn’t able to exert all that much force. I was only capable of weakening the projectiles that came at us. Stopping them altogether was simply not an option.</p>
<p>Still, I at least had to try.</p>
<p>Fran had already pushed herself to the limit. She'd already started using several skills and spells in conjunction. Moreover was the fact that she’d also already initiated a full force charge in the pill bug’s direction — there was no way for her to suddenly avoid the bug’s counter. She simply didn’t have the liberty to do so.</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>『Short Ju-』</p>
<p>I immediately tried teleporting us out the moment I heard Fran groan.</p>
<p>We needed to make a bit of distance between us and the pill bug if we wanted to be able to escape it.</p>
<p>（Don’t!）</p>
<p>But Fran stopped me from actually casting the spell. Unlike me, she had yet to give up on the assault. She put the left half of her body forward in order to shield her dominant hand from harm. The black catgirl supported efforts further by cancelling some of her offensive skills in order to erect a barrier, one that would assist in her in her charge. She even made use of the Air Jump skill in order to make sure she wouldn’t get blown away.</p>
<p>Fran firmly held her ground, but as one could expect, she was unable to remain unscathed. The combination of Fran’s barrier and my telekinesis were able to drastically reduce the attack’s power, but each of the projectiles still held enough force to rend Fran’s flesh; countless shell fragments embedded themselves inside of her.</p>
<p>The numerous wounds that’d been torn into her body were painful enough to make even the most mature adults scream in pain, but she managed endure the bug's last stand by gritting her teeth and grinding down on them.</p>
<p>「Burniaaaaaa!」</p>
<p>Fran used a flame spell to hit the gas yet again as she thrust me at the pill bug with all her might. The attack the magic beast fired off had rid it of its hard exterior and rendered it defenseless. Hence, my blade sank into its exposed body as easily as a hot knife would a block of butter.</p>
<p>I felt not the sensation of a hard exoskeleton, but instead the softness of tearing flesh as my body was driven inside of the insect's.</p>
<p>「Haah… Guh….」</p>
<p>Fran had managed to embed me within the pill bug’s, but she’d lost a lot of her own strength and stamina in the process. She seemed completely exhausted and on the verge of going limp.</p>
<p>『Come on Fran. Hang in there, you’ve almost got it!』</p>
<p>「Will finish now…」</p>
<p>『Do it!』</p>
<p>Shit. I’m not sure she’ll be able to fight much longer. It’d be best for me to try finishing the damned thing off here and now.</p>
<p>I already knew exactly what to do. A clear image of my intentions resonated within my mind as I solidified them.</p>
<p>I focused all my magical energies into my blade and activated Vibration Fang and Wind Elemental Blade simultaneously. I then directed my attention towards the use of transformation and manipulated my body in much the same way the System Announcer had done before me. I imitated the actions she took when she’d used thin, sharp strands of my blade to absorb the numerous Skeletons’ magic stones. That is, I warped my body whilst retaining the image of having thin threads extend from my tip.</p>
<p>A hundred steel fibres parted from my body and began shredding the pill bug from inside out. I backed the the effort further by throwing the Thread Manipulation skill into the mix. I forcibly controlled every last part of my body in order to have its strands run rampant within the pill bug's figure.</p>
<p>I wasn’t able to manipulate myself nearly as skillfully as the System Announcer had, but that was honestly something I’d already been expecting.</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran pitched in as well and used Elemental Blade to cloak my body in lightning.</p>
<p>「Gigiii…. Giiiiiiii!!」</p>
<p>Fran’s actions functioned as a finishing blow; her spell caused the pill bug to let out one last cry as it lost its life. The strength drained from its limbs. Its body’s functions slowed to a stop.</p>
<p>〈Self Evolution has activated. You have gained 60 self-evolution points.〉</p>
<p>I ranked up. That was nice and all, but I had priorities. What mattered right now was Fran. I made use of my telekinetic abilities and gently laid her down on the boss room’s floor.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

        </div>
        
<p>『Greater Heal!』</p>
<p>「Uu…」</p>
<p>『Fran, are you alright?』</p>
<p>「Master…」</p>
<p>Whew, looked like I managed to heal her in time. Most of her larger wounds had closed up. She was still alive and kicking.</p>
<p>「Won…?」</p>
<p>『That we did.』</p>
<p>Fran pushed herself off the ground with both arms in response to my words.</p>
<p>「First victory in long time.」</p>
<p>『What do you mean?』</p>
<p>「First time in long time facing strong enemy head on and winning.」</p>
<p>Hearing Fran say that made me think about all the strong foes we had faced in the past.</p>
<p>The demon we fought hadn’t been able to show its true potential, and we’d only won because it’d basically half screwed itself.</p>
<p>Amanda always completely rekt us every time we spared her.</p>
<p>The Lich totally destroyed us. We probably would’ve died if not for the System Announcer.</p>
<p>Fran hadn’t been able to engage in direct combat with the Midgard Wyrm. Plus, we didn’t end up actually taking that one down either.</p>
<p>We only won against Rynford because of the people that’d helped us beat him back. We probably would’ve lost otherwise.</p>
<p>There was only a single instance in which we went head on against anything that was considered a C level threat or higher and won, and that was when we fought the Legendary Skeleton.</p>
<p>〈Fran has reached level 45.〉</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>『Nice! You finally did it!』<br>

<p>I couldn’t help but feel good about the fact that I finally had over 600 base attack. I’d only ever seen a few with numbers that high.</p>
<p>Heh, I was finally strong enough to be worthy of a sword with a name, even without all my skills and what not. I’m no longer the same sword I once was! No way in hell I’ll ever get depressed by appraising one of Gallus’ swords ever again!</p>

_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Defeating the pill bug had allowed Urushi to gain a level; he’d finally hit level 30. He needed way more exp than Fran to get anywhere at all, but he was still gradually making gains.</p>
<p>「Urushi, strong.」</p>
<p>『And I think he’s learned a new skill too. I’m pretty sure he didn’t used to have Claw Arts.』</p>
<p>He always did like battering his enemies with his front paws, but I guess he never really used his claws until after he equipped the Claw of Capture.</p>
<p>Urushi picked up a nearby rock and tossed it into the air. He watched it for a bit and used his hind legs to stand up while skillfully swiping at it with his front right paw. A series of claws extended the moment he attacked and easily split the rock in four. The attack appeared both fast and powerful, it could definitely be put to good use, especially when taking the Claw of Capture’s paralysis effect into consideration.</p>
<p>「Nn. Urushi, cool.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>The fact that Urushi was praised made him so happy he nearly jumped for joy.</p>
<p>You know, Urushi was actually pretty damned strong for a magic beast ranked in at a C ranked threat. His stats were relatively high, and he had an incredible amount of skills compared to the pill bug and basically everything else like it.</p>
<p>He might even end up being considered a B ranked threat if he just levels up and grows a bit more.</p>
<p>That said, he was lacking both in combat experience and composure. He also wasn’t really like… wild enough. I guess that’s kind of my fault because of how much I spoiled him, but how could I not? Just look at how adorable he is. He’s capable of two way communication, and even listens to what we say even without the need for any sort of disciplinary action. He’s practically a dog owner's wet dream.</p>
<p>In fact, he was only just responding to Fran petting his head by narrowing his eyes and wagging his tail. I mean, that’s at least better than flipping over and showing his belly, but, still. It’d probably be better for us to be a bit more strict with him.</p>
<p>「Master. What next?」</p>
<p>『Oh, right, I got side tracked, my bad.』</p>
<p>We shouldn’t just be hanging around like usual. We didn’t come all the way here just so we could beat up the boss. We were here to see the Dungeon Master.</p>
<p>I shoved the Disaster Pill Bug’s corpse in storage and had us survey the boss room for the time being.</p>
<p>We were currently at what was supposedly the dungeon’s deepest depths, but I expected a door or pathway of some sort to open up after we beat the boss regardless.</p>
<p>What actually happened differed from, but still kinda resembled what I’d expected. That is, a glimmering pillar of light appeared at the room’s center after a bit of a short wait.</p>
<p>「Master. Something appeared.」</p>
<p>『Looks like the info we got was spot on.』</p>
<p>The pillar was a teleportation device, specifically one that’d return all who entered it to the dungeon entrance. It’d normally be a helpful device as it’d save you the walk, but, it wasn’t what we’d been looking for. Entering it would force us back out the dungeon.</p>
<p>『Let’s try investigating the room and seeing if we can find anything.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We looked around for about 10 minutes, but we weren’t able to find any sort of hidden area.</p>
<p>Er, actually that's not right. I mean, we did technically find a spot that seemed like it had something on the other side, but we couldn’t figure out how we were supposed to get to it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like the other areas in the sense that it the Dungeon Master had restricted access to it. Forcing ourselves in probably wasn’t that great of an idea. We’d be putting not only the request, but also Fran’s life at risk.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>『Hmmm… What do?』</p>
<p>「Hmm?」</p>
<p>Oh wait. You know, thinking about it, it wasn’t actually absolutely necessary for us to go to where the Dungeon Master was. We could just have her come out instead.</p>
<p>『Hey Fran, try showing off the pendant Aurel gave you.』</p>
<p>「Nn? Got it.」</p>
<p>Fran rummaged through her dimensional storage and pulled the pendant from out within it.</p>
<p>『Now try calling the Dungeon Master.』</p>
<p>「Got it. Dungeon Master. Delivery.」</p>
<p>She raised the pendant overhead as she spoke.</p>
<p>I was pretty sure that calling the Dungeon Master would work. We’d just beaten the boss, so chances were, the Dungeon Master probably had her eyes on us right about now.</p>
<p>And you know what, we can just try something else if it doesn’t work. It’s not like giving it a shot would cause any harm.</p>
<p>「Delivery here.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>「Are you perhaps on one of Dias’ or Aurel’s errands?」</p>
<p>A young woman’s, presumably the Dungeon Master’s, voice resounded through the room after we tried calling out a few times.<br>
「Nn. Aurel.」</p>
<p>「I see… Very well. I request you wait a brief moment.」</p>
<p>A hole appeared in one of the walls shortly after the woman voiced her agreement. It seemed to lead to the area that we’d suspected just a bit earlier.</p>
<p>「You may enter.」</p>
<p>The corridor didn’t have any traps in it. Still, I couldn’t help but worry that we’d be lead to a room full of magic beasts or traps. It wasn’t impossible for the Dungeon Master to choose to do precisely that, so we proceeded with caution. I made sure to have a bit of teleportation magic queued up just in cast.</p>
<p>However, our concerns ended up appearing to be in excess. There weren’t any magic beasts anywhere to be found. The path was well, just a normal path.</p>
<p>The passage’s only defining traits were its dimness and the softness of the light that seemed to shine through from where it lead.</p>
<p>A magnificent sight reached us once we finally arrived at the tunnel’s exit. The room it lead to looked like it’d come straight out of some noble’s mansion. It was incredibly wide, and filled to the brim with all sorts of gaudy furniture.</p>
<p>A beautiful woman of about 30 years stood in the room’s centre. The robe-like thing she wore made it look like she was in the midst of enjoying a sort of leisurely respite. Her body was rather slim, and her face charming, but I still couldn’t help but feel that she gave off the air of a warrior, a perfect balance of strength and beauty.</p>
<p>She was strong, incredibly so. I knew it from the moment I first laid eyes on her, but I couldn’t tell exactly how strong she was. Either way, she was at least stronger than we were. In fact, she was probably at least a match for Amanda.</p>
<p>I didn’t feel any bloodlust or malice from her, so I managed to avoid putting myself on guard. However, I surely would’ve immediately switched to battle mode if we came across her under any other set of circumstances, especially so if we were in a dungeon, seeing as how dungeon goers had the tendency to be more easily aggravated.</p>
<p>To be honest, I actually tried appraising her, but it seemed she had access to Appraisal Jamming, and thus, I wasn’t able to really get many details out of it. I only managed to learn her name, confirm the fact that she was the Dungeon Master, and figure out a few of her skills.</p>
<p>That said though, my attention had already been drawn elsewhere.</p>
<p>Her head sported a pair of black cat ears, and her rear a black tail. Both of these identifying features were ones that I were rather familiar with. They practically looked identical to Fran’s, after all.</p>
<p>『Is she a Black Catkin…?』</p>
<p>「You’ve done well to venture this far. I welcome you, fellow sister of the Black Cat Tribe.」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran immediately took to her right knee with her left fist pressed against the ground the moment the woman welcomed her. She’d placed her right hand behind her back and placed it on her waist.</p>
<p>「Thank you for gracing me with your presence. I believe this to be our first meeting. I am Fran, of the Black Cat Tribe.」</p>
<p>Fran kicked her Court Etiquette skill into full swing and bowed whilst speaking in a manner that completely differed from her usual one. Her greeting was not like that of a retainer, but more so like that of someone acknowledging another’s superiority. I guess that’s just a beastkin thing?</p>
<p>「And I am Rumina, Warrior to the Black Cat Tribe and the master of this dungeon.」</p>
<p>I knew it, she was a Black Catkin, but that doesn't really explain why Fran suddenly went all out with the etiquette. I was confused, but didn't have to wait all that long to find out, as the pair's next exchange provided the answer I'd been looking for.</p>
<p>「Might I presume you to be a Black Tigerkin?」</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha, that is correct. Allow me to reintroduce myself. I am Rumina, one of the Black Cat Tribe’s Black Tigerkun.」</p>
<p>Ah, so that’s it. Fran’s respect stemmed from the fact that the person that stood before her was one that'd achieved her goal.</p>
<p>「Again, I welcome you to my domain.」</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>

		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>166. Of Rumina and Hope</b></p>
<p>『I’m honestly surprised you had it figured out.』</p>
<p>（Had what?）</p>
<p>『The fact that she was a Black Tigerkin in particular. I mean, this is your first time ever even hearing about the fact that Black Catkin could actually evolve, right?』</p>
<p>（Given, since same tribe. Can tell just by looking.）</p>
<p>Oh, right, I remember her saying a bit ago that Beastkin could differentiate between the evolved and unevolved. I guess the fact that they’re both Black Catkin only deepens her understanding of Rumina's state all the more.</p>
<p>「I will prepare you a seat. Do make use of it.」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>Rumina, the Dungeon Master, went out of her way to procure Fran a chair. It seemed that she wasn’t a bad person despite the fact that she was extremely intimidating.</p>
<p>Fran rose from her prior position and seated herself in the chair Rumina had prepped for her. You know, this is the first time I’ve ever seen her be listen to anyone other than myself with such a degree of earnestness. She was acting in the same manner as one would upon meeting some sort of celebrity or hero that they’d always looked up to.</p>
<p>In fact, her eyes almost seemed to sparkle every time she looked in Rumina’s direction. Likewise, her ears and tail both continued to move around restlessly. I could only gauge the manner in which she was acting to be normal. The person before her held the key that’d allow her realize her desires, or at least the closest thing to it.</p>
<p>「That wolf of yours… No, nevermind me. Let us disregard my mention of the topic and move on.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Urushi was sitting on the carpet with his limbs sprawled, not because he’d gotten attached to Rumina, but instead because he understood that he should listen to her because she was above him, and therefore should not be offended. Yup, that’s a canine for you.</p>
<p>「I believe you stated that you came on Aurel’s behalf?」</p>
<p>「This.」</p>
<p>「Oh…? So that is what he intended.」</p>
<p>Rumina nodded in acknowledgement after taking the pendant from Fran’s hands and looking it over.</p>
<p>「It appears to be genuine.」</p>
<p>She fiddled with something at pendant’s centre and flipped it open to reveal a small piece of paper. It seemed that the paper was actually what we’d been tasked to deliver.</p>
<p>Rumina unfolded the piece of paper, the letter, and looked over its contents with a bit of a pondering expression.</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Growl!」</p>
<p>An incredible amount of bloodlust leaked out of Rumina’s body. It’d been sustained for but an instant, but the sheer strength of it had caused Fran to jump with a start, and Urushi to growl whilst raising his body.</p>
<p>「Apologies. I merely happened to recall an unpleasant memory.」</p>
<p>Rumina smiled a gentle, refreshing smile. The bloodlust that stemmed from her body was nowhere to be seen — not that it’d been directed towards us in the first place.</p>
<p>Whew, that had me on edge. It seemed that the same had happened to Fran, as she only just managed to sit herself back down.</p>
<p>「Provide that Aurel kid with my acknowledgement.」</p>
<p>Rumina handed Aurel’s pendant back to Fran.</p>
<p>「Pendant?」</p>
<p>「I’ve no longer any need for it. Return it to Aurel.」</p>
<p>Turned out she really didn’t care about the pendant itself.</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>Wait, did she just call Aurel a kid? I swear the dude’s like at least 70. The hell? Rumina looks like she’s around 30.</p>
<p>「Rumina, seems young?」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! You are quite the brave one. I believe this to be the first time anyone has ever asked my age since I became this dungeon’s master.」</p>
<p>Rumina’s words didn’t carry even the slightest hint of anger. In fact, she instead regarded Fran with a kind, grandmotherly expression. It seemed that she was acting a bit more relaxed than she otherwise would have because she and Fran were of the same tribe. Likewise, Fran was continuing to act rather respectfully despite having reverted back to her usual curt manner of speech. I guess that’s just what it meant to be of the same tribe; the relationship they shared was just flat out special.</p>
<p>「I’ve stopped keeping tally ever since becoming a Dungeon Master, but I believe I should at least be five hundred years of age.」</p>
<p>According to Rumina, she stopped aging the moment she became a Dungeon Master. She could apparently only die if the dungeon core was destroyed if someone was to actually just straight up murder her.</p>
<p>「It is possible for Dungeon Masters to alter their appearances through the use of magic, but I myself have chosen to remain as I was on the day that I was first changed.」</p>

        </div>
        
<p>In other words, Rumina had lived a long life despite her appearance and attained evolution with her very own hands.</p>
<p>「Rumina.」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>Fran righted her seating posture and gazed in Rumina’s direction. In doing so, she conveyed to the other party that she wanted to talk about something serious. Rumina seemed to catch her drift, as she returned the younger catgirl’s gaze.</p>
<p>「Black catkin… can evolve?」</p>
<p>Fran cut straight to the point and asked the about the one thing she wanted to know about most.</p>
<p>Rumina had the answer and was right before us, but I still couldn’t help but worry that she wouldn’t be able to get her hands on what she sought.</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>Fran held her breath and squeezed her hands in anticipation; a moment of silence persisted as she stared straight at Rumina and awaited her answer.</p>
<p>「Without a doubt.」</p>
<p>「I see.」</p>
<p>Fran was flooded with a whole assortment of emotions, all at once. They were so fierce and numerous that they rendered her unable to provide anything but a short response. She didn’t just feel joy or hope. She also recalled all the hardships that she’d gone through, all the her frustrations and pains. Above all, there was relief. She learned that the path she’d walked was not one travelled in vain.</p>
<p>That single short phrase of her carried with it every single one of her feelings.</p>
<p>「I want… to evolve.」</p>
<p>「Yes, and?」</p>
<p>「Please tell me what I need to do to evolve.」</p>
<p>Fran immediately placed both her hands on the table and lowered her head as she awaited Rumina’s answer. Chances were she probably would’ve totally genuflected or prostrated had she been on the ground.</p>
<p>I too focused all my attention on Rumina and awaited her reply.</p>
<p>「I would love to instruct you my method of evolution.」</p>
<p>「Then!」</p>
<p>Fran lifted her face as her body leaned itself in Rumina’s direction. Her face was flushed, and her mouth half open. She was clearly as excited as could be.</p>
<p>But Rumina’s next words cut it all short.</p>
<p>「But that is not meant to be… I cannot directly convey to you my methodologies in their entirety.」</p>
<p>「Why…?」</p>
<p>Fran’s expression twisted into one of desperation.</p>
<p>「I am sorry…」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>Fran fell back into her seat like a puppet with its strings cut. She probably would’ve totally fallen over if not for her chair’s backrest.</p>
<p>She was very clearly disappointed. The key that’d allow her to achieve her goal had been dangled in front of her only to be taken away before she had any chance of actually grabbing at it.</p>
<p>Still, I think she did a good job holding in her discontent.</p>
<p>Rumina’s expression did the same as Fran’s and darkened. But unlike Fran, her eyes were filled with pain.</p>
<p>「My sincerest apologies. I would have been willing to tell you it all if I was not a Dungeon Master.」</p>
<p>「Meaning…?」</p>
<p>「The Goddess of Chaos grants upon Dungeon Masters a large number of blessings. We are given the ability to manage a dungeon and eternal youth, but blessings are not all we are given. The goddess also binds us with a curse.」</p>
<p>Rumina informed us that she wasn’t able to tell us too much. She was restricted in her speech with regards to the dungeon and its workings.</p>
<p>She wasn’t capable of conveying any restricted information, be it through speech or writing.</p>
<p>「So Goddess of Chaos related to Black Catkin evolution?」</p>
<p>「Indeed. We of the Black Cat Tribe were shackled by the will of the Gods five hundred years prior. Thus, I am now the last Black Tigerkin.」</p>
<p>「One question.」</p>
<p>「Very well. I shall answer any question I am capable of answering.」</p>
<p>「Black Catkin, evolution impossible?」</p>
<p>「That would be incorrect. It is simply difficult for our members to attain evolution.」</p>
<p>Rumina’s answer hit Fran with a wave of relief. It seemed she could have hope so long as it was still possible.</p>
<p>「Okay. But, why Gods made more difficult?」</p>
<p>「That… I cannot tell you, for I know not the answer.」</p>
<p>「Then, how to evolve in the past?」</p>
<p>「Kuh… Apologies. I cannot tell you that either.」</p>
<p>Rumina clenched her teeth and lowered her gaze. It seemed that she was feeling just as frustrated as Fran was. She wanted to help her fellow tribesman evolve, but was simply unable to.</p>
<p>「What… if I was to tell you…」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「What manner of choice would you make if I was to tell you that you could evolve if you simply chose to slay me?」</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>167. The Extent of a Black Tigerkin’s Power</b></p>
<p>Rumina suddenly suggested something that I could only describe as outrageous.</p>
<p>「What manner of choice would you make if I was to tell you that you could evolve if you simply chose to slay me?」</p>
<p>「If I… kill you?」</p>
<p>「’Tis just hypothetical, but do give me an answer.」</p>
<p>「Won’t kill.」</p>
<p>Fran's reaction came immediately.</p>
<p>Her response was exactly what I’d expected it to be. Fran wanted to evolve, not for vanity, but for the sake of her tribe’s pride. There was simply no way she’d be willing to trade the life of one that’d accomplished her goal in order to fulfill it. Plus, Dias had totally nailed into us the fact that we weren’t allowed to kill the Dungeon Master — not that I thought we were actually capable of doing so in the first place.</p>
<p>The guild would end up labeling us a traitor even if we actually did manage to kill her, so in that sense, we technically just couldn't.</p>
<p>「So that is your answer… It was exactly what I had expected it to be. Quite the resemblence you bear…」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「I was merely rambling, do not mind me nor the odd question I posed. Unfortunately, that is all I have to tell you regarding evolution.」</p>
<p>Why’d she just ask us that? Could it maybe… be true? Nah, no way, right? I mean, she wouldn’t have been able to ask us the question if that were to be the case. But like, would she really ask us something like that for literally no reason? It had to be some sort of hint, at the very least.</p>
<p>Was killing another member of the black cat tribe supposed to be what’d allow her to evolve? Or what about maybe just killing a Dungeon Master of some sort? Wait no, can’t be that one. We’d already killed that one Goblin Dungeon Master guy already.</p>
<p>Hmmm, iunno. I don’t get it.</p>
<p>「It is not much for consolation, but do have yourself a cup of a tea.」</p>
<p>Rumina offered Fran a drink and started talking to her about the Black Cat Tribe’s village in an attempt to cheer her up. It seemed that the two were able to converse as much as they’d like so long as the topic didn’t pertain to evolution.</p>
<p>She described that it was normal for Black Catkin to evolve 500 years ago, back before she became the dungeon’s master. They didn’t used to be considered as inferior to any of the other beastkin races. In fact, they’d been one of the most respected tribes. She wasn’t able to tell us too many details about what had happened way back then, but, she recounted what she could.</p>
<p>I couldn’t really understand the exact extent to which the Goddess restricted one’s ability to disclose information, but it evidently stopped her from talking about evolution or the reasons for which the Black Catkin ended up under their current circumstances in the first place.</p>
<p>The Black Cat Tribe’s history had practically been wiped clean off the board. The only people that still knew it were probably the elves, seeing as how they were long lived. I’d really like to talk to one and ask why the gods wanted to go as far as even making it seem like Black Catkin were unable to evolve.</p>
<p>Fran and Rumina ended up having a fairly long conversation despite the fact that they weren’t able to discuss evolution. Neither had met another Black Catkin in quite a long while, so they really hit it off.</p>
<p>「Ah, right… I do have one last matter I’d like to ask if you, if you would not mind it.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Won’t mind anything.」</p>
<p>「Hahaha, worry not. It is nothing difficult. I would simply like to ask you to convey to Dias a message for me.」</p>
<p>「Dias? Not Aurel?」</p>
<p>「Yes, Dias. My message to him is but a single phrase: Fulfill the contract. Do well to remember it.」</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>「Have you anything you would like to request of me in return? I will do for you anything that I am capable of.」</p>
<p>「Request?」</p>
<p>「Indeed.」</p>
<p>Rumina’s question caused Fran to fall into thought. I was fairly certain that she was thinking of and dismissing a whole slew of ideas.</p>
<p>（Master?）</p>
<p>『She did say you ask for whatever you wanted, so just do that. Voice whatever happens to come to mind.』</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>「Have you a request?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran quietly nodded as she looked at Rumina with a gaze like that of a warrior.</p>
<p>「Want to spar.」</p>
<p>「Oh?」</p>
<p>「Want to see extent of Black Tiger’s power.」</p>
<p>I had to say, it really was like Fran to want something like this. She wanted to experience first hand the power that she sought.</p>
<p>Rumina responded to Fran’s request with a heartfelt, entertained smile.</p>
<p>「Very well. I shall show you my strength. I will, however, first require a moment, as I must prepare.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I shall provide you a servant for the time being. Order it as you will.」</p>
<p>A wooden doll, much like the ones used in character design, materialized in response to Rumina’s words.</p>
<p>It refilled Fran’s cup with movements as fluid as those of a human.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>「Thanks.」</p>
<p>The doll not only nodded in response to Fran, but also retrieved some cookies and chocolate from a shelf in one of the room’s corners before presenting them as if serving her.</p>
<p>From the aforementioned actions, I understood that it was basically Rumina’s familiar despite the fact that it wasn’t capable of speech.</p>
<p>「Nn. Tasty.」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>「I seem to have kept you waiting for quite the amount of time.」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>Rumina returned after ten odd minutes. She claimed to be ready, but looked exactly the same as she had before setting out.</p>
<p>She was still wearing the same thing, a thin outfit made of cloth that seemed to resemble a noble’s casual wear. Her body hadn’t been decorated with even a single piece of armour.</p>
<p>Her sword was pretty sharp, but it didn’t emanate any magical power; it didn’t seem to have any special properties or abilities.</p>
<p>「Follow after me.」</p>
<p>Rumina lead us to a dome-shaped room with a diameter about a hundred meters across.</p>
<p>「I have only just made this room, and thus, ’tis a bit dreary. Unfortunately, it was all I could prepare as I hadn’t a suitable space for us to spar in. Have you any particular complaints with this space?」</p>
<p>Apparently, Rumina hadn’t gone off to prepare a room of any sort. She had instead been working on preparing a room. Yup, that’s a Dungeon Master for ya. The scale she thinks on is completely different from our own.</p>
<p>（Master, just watch.）</p>
<p>『Yeah, I know. You do you.』</p>
<p>I mean, it’s not like they’re fighting for real. It’s just a spar, so yeah.</p>
<p>「Shall we start?」</p>
<p>「No equipment?」</p>
<p>「Oh? Have you confidence in your ability to land a blow?」</p>
<p>「Of course.」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! How spirited you are. Fear not, my clothes have been enhanced through the magical arts. It offers greater defenses than most armours crafted of metal. I have also in my possession a Sacrificial Bracelet.」</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>「Now then, I believe it should be time for us to begin?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>And begin they did. Rumina, like Fran, was a swordsman. The way she traded blows with Fran demonstrated the fact that she was highly skilled.</p>
<p>Her Appraisal Jamming skill made it so I was only able to pick up on her detection based skills, so I was only now able to find out that she was capable of casting magic. That is, I could tell at a glance that she had access to the Magic Manipulation skill.</p>
<p>They began at a milder pace, and probed at each other for the sake of evaluating each other’s skill. From there, the two gradually picked up the pace and started swinging in sharper, faster manners.</p>
<p>「Splendid! Your skill with the sword is incredible for one of such a young age.」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>「What? Can you no longer keep up?」</p>
<p>「Haaah!」</p>
<p>「You have erred! Your blow would have been much more effective had you taken another step forward.」</p>
<p>Rumina was, as one would expect, much more skilled than Fran. The older Black Catkin had the liberty to verbalize the other’s mistakes despite her going all out. Her precise manner of doing so was like that of a coach or teacher.<br>
「That is not all you have, is it? Display to me all you can!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Fire Javelin!」</p>
<p>Fran created a spear wreathed in flame as she threw yet another slash. Her plan had been to distract Rumina in order to land a blow with a two pronged attack, but her attempts ended in utter failure. The flames hadn’t been enough to offer even the slightest distraction.</p>
<p>「You are far too naive! A spell like that fails to so much as even serve as a distraction!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Their battle transformed from one purely based in swordplay to a fierce exchange of spells. Rumina turned out to be capable of using both the fire and wind elements.</p>
<p>The two fought for what felt like an hour.</p>
<p>Fran was out of breath. Rumina, on the other hand, merely looked satisfied.</p>
<p>「You are incredibly strong for a Black Catkin that has yet to evolve. You will surely become strong enough to leave your name in history should you find a path to evolution.」</p>
<p>She spoke with a smile, but quickly twisted her expression into a more stern one.</p>
<p>「It is about time for us to bring this session to an end. I shall do you the favour of putting a portion of the very power you desire on display for my last act. Worry not, I shalln’t kill you.」</p>
<p>「Bring it on.」</p>
<p>My blade trembled as an incredible amount of magical energy suddenly burst out of Rumina’s body. Holy crap. She had to be at least as strong as Rynford.</p>
<p>「Then here I come…. Thunderclap!」</p>
<p>I’m not sure if it was because of I was super focused on her or what, but everything Rumina had said sounded clear to me despite the fact that she’d muttered the first half of it. The attack she launched caused an incredibly bright flash and sent Fran flying across the room.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>PSA. Thunderclap -&gt; Lightning Rush. See release post for more info.</b></p>
<p><b>168. Lightning Rush</b></p>
<p>「Lightning Rush!」</p>
<p>Fran flew; the attack that followed Rumina’s shout launched her a whole 30 meters. Her body sank into and shattered the wall despite it looking like it was made of a rather tough material.</p>
<p>Holy fuck! The hell just happened!? The attack was so quick that I couldn’t see shit!</p>
<p>I had no idea exactly how it all happened, but Rumina was now standing exactly where Fran had been just a moment ago. We, on the other hand, had been sent flying. I mean, I did feel like we’d gotten hit by something, but I wasn’t able to tell what that something had been.</p>
<p>Only a few moments after receiving the attack did I finally begin to process any information pertinent to it. The attack’s name, the fact that I’d felt a slight shock right as Rumina collided with us, and the smoking burn mark on Fran’s chest all pointed towards the fact that she’d attacked us with something based in the lightning element.</p>
<p>『Fran! You okay?』</p>
<p>「Ugh… Heal.」</p>
<p>Fran coughed up a wad of blood as if to evidence that her internals had suffered a good bit of damage. Luckily, it looked like she was still alive and kicking regardless.</p>
<p>Rumina really had followed through with her declaration. She’d inflicted a pretty major injury, but Fran had managed to live through it. It seemed that she’d only used this attack because she’d become convinced of the fact that Fran would be able to tank it.</p>
<p>「Are you alright? I accidentally put a slight excess of force into the attack as it has been far too long since I have had the chance to enjoy a battle like this one.」</p>
<p>Though it looked like she messed up a bit.</p>
<p>「I had only intended on blowing you aback.」</p>
<p>Rumina hurried over and used a potion on Fran.</p>
<p>Man, just what the hell was that Lightning Rush thing anyways? It was so damn fast that I honestly couldn’t tell.</p>
<p>That, however, didn’t mean I didn’t have any idea as to its identity. The term Innate Skill floated through my mind despite the fact that I had no confirmation as to whether or not she’d even used a skill in the first place. Rumina’s words had mentioned that she wanted to show Fran what was to come, that she would show her a Black Tigerkin’s power. In other words, the attack she just showcased would logically be a skill innate to Black Tigerkin.</p>
<p>Though I hadn’t been able to observe it, I had at least learned that the epitome of strength still lay far beyond.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>「It is regrettable, but I must not keep you in a pen with me in perpetuity.」</p>
<p>Rumina spoke to Fran, whose wounds had been healed, in a tone filled with lament.</p>
<p>The younger Black Catkin seemed to feel the same, as her gaze was cast downwards in loneliness. However, her feelings were only second to her goal. It was mission critical for her to go back out into the world so she could find out more about evolution. We were still betting on us being able to get a few hints from Aurel seeing as how he’d gone out of his way to ask us to do this and everything.</p>
<p>I mean, I didn’t think him sending us here was just a coincidence, as he knew Rumina. He himself had evolved as well, so I figured there was no way he didn’t know she herself was someone that’d evolved. He also knew that Fran was a Black Catkin. Throw in all those factors, and you have for yourself something that could only possibly be some sort of setup.</p>
<p>Om fact, it almost felt like he’d only acted in order to acquaint Fran and Rumina with one another. It would only make sense for him to know something about the Black Cat Tribe’s evolution, or at least something that’d be of help to us.</p>
<p>「The teleportation device left in the boss room has yet to deactivate. Entering it will allow you to return to the dungeon entrance.」</p>
<p>「Can meet again in future…?」</p>
<p>「Hahaha. That, I would enjoy. I shall arrange it so that you will have the opportunity to visit me simply by visiting the boss room. 」</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>Rumina ruffled Fran’s hair, which caused the younger girl’s eyes to narrow and ears to twitch in delight.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>『You sure you’re all set?』</p>
<p>（Nn.）</p>
<p>The two stalled for about 10 or so minutes because they were rather reluctant to part. I myself thought it’d be fine for the two to enjoy a bit more time together, but Fran herself had decided it was time to go. She said goodbye to Rumina and started walking back towards the boss room.</p>
<p>「Farewell.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran turned back several times, but eventually managed to get herself to leave, albeit whilst looking back in Rumina’s direction.</p>
<p>「Bye bye.」</p>
<p>「A path to your goal most definitely exists. ‘Tis narrow and full of obstacles, but it is not one you will be unable to traverse so long as you persevere.」</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Rumina gave her one last shout of encouragement as the the teleportation circle’s light enveloped us and brought us back up to the surface.</p>
<p>The dungeon’s entrance looked just the same that it had a few days ago.</p>
<p>『I guess we might as well go hit up Aurel and tell him we’re done.』</p>
<p>We tried to leave the fortress that surrounded the place in order to make our way over to Aurel’s mansion, but we weren’t able to as we were almost immediately swarmed by the guards and adventurers in the area.</p>
<p>Apparently the adventurers standing right outside the dungeon had noticed that we teleported in, and immediately started spreading the news.</p>
<p>「Damn! Looks like she’s back in one piece.」</p>
<p>「You just teleported, right? Doesn’t that mean you beat the boss?」</p>
<p>「Really gotta give it to her. That’s the girl subjugated those dirty thieves for you.」</p>
<p>「You planning to stay solo? Cause my party would be glad to have ya.」</p>
<p>「She’d be much more at home in our party. We’ve got way more girls than you guys.」</p>
<p>Holy crap. Everyone was acting like they loved us.</p>
<p>It seemed that beating the boss, and by extension, teleporting back to town, was a status symbol of sorts, an act that earned the respect of Ulmutt’s adventurers. This held especially true if the dungeon in question was the eastern one, seeing as how it was the more difficult of the two.</p>
<p>The fact that she was young and entirely solo, Urushi aside, only made her achievement shine all the more.</p>
<p>All ten or so of the adventurers bombarded us with their questions and comments. The answers she gave them caused their eyes to sparkle as they raised their voices in wonder. Even hardened veterans far older than herself were looking at her with admiration. I thought it to be a rather funny sight, but Fran seemed happy, so all was good.</p>
<p>「You charged into a horde of High Ogres all by yourself?」</p>
<p>「Wow, I can’t believe you actually managed to disarm that trap!」</p>
<p>「What was the boss like?」</p>
<p>A certain blob of muscle raced over and liberated Fran from the onslaught shortly after it started.</p>
<p>「Mmkay everyone, that’ll be it for questions.」</p>
<p>「Erza.」</p>
<p>「It’s been so long since I last saw you! I was so worried cause you never came back out of the dungeon.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Was training.」</p>
<p>「I know, but I just couldn’t help but be worried.」</p>
<p>Erza’s eyes dampened as he twisted his body back and forth on the spot. It looked like he really was worried about her. I mean, I was grateful that he was, but I honestly couldn’t stand how uncute his actions were.</p>
<p>「And I’m sure you’re just exhausted from the boss fight, mh,m. This dungeon’s really well known for how it likes to throw bosses that scale with you and work against your weaknesses. You’re really strong Fran, so I’m sure you would’ve gotten a magic beast whose threat level was at least a C.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Got one.」</p>
<p>「Weally? Are you okay? You’re not hurt, right?」</p>
<p>「Already healed.」</p>
<p>「Already? So you really did get hurt? Waaaaow, I really should’ve come with you. Everything would’ve been totally A-Ok.」</p>
<p>「But then not good for training.」</p>
<p>「Mhmm. That’s true. You know, I really love how stoic you are Fran. It’s so adorbs. Being able to beat a C ranked threat with just you and your puppers means you’re reallllly strong too.」</p>
<p>Wait, why’s Erza here anyways? Is this just a coincidence, or?</p>
<p>「Hey sis, Erza, weren’t you here because you had something to you wanted to talk about?」</p>
<p>「Ah, right! Yeah, I did!」</p>
<p>Apparently it wasn’t any sort of coincidence, as one of the guards promptly called out to the buff dude had actually asked to be notified when Fran made her way back to town. Said guard also reminded him that he apparently did have some sort of business.</p>
<p>「Whoopsie daisy. Sorry, I almost forgot. I was just super excited because I hadn’t seen Fran in so long.」</p>
<p>Oh god why. Please, no. Please never stick your tongue out and wink at the same time ever again.</p>
<p>I mean, I knew Erza was actually a pretty good guy, but that’s just gross.</p>
<p>「Something?」</p>
<p>「Mhm! But it’s not something we can talk about out in the open, so let’s head back to the guild first.」</p>
<p>「But need to tell Aurel quest clear.」</p>
<p>『We can have the Guildmaster just send him a message or something, so there shouldn’t be any issue with us heading there first.』</p>
<p>「Nn? On second thought, will go to guild first.」</p>
<p>「Is that really okay? Are you sure you don’t need to talk to the old man first?」</p>
<p>「No issues.」</p>
<p>And so, we had Erza lead us back to the guild.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>169. The Lion-Topped Carriage</b></p>
<p>A sudden important reminder popped itself into my head as we made our way in the guild’s direction.</p>
<p>『You think leveling up Thought Isolation might be a good idea seeing as how we’re about to have to talk to the Guildmaster?』</p>
<p>（Nn. Sounds good since still level 1.）</p>
<p>『Yeah, but there kinda is a problem. Iunno how he’ll react to us suddenly having the skill at a decent level.』</p>
<p>If I was him I’d think it pretty sketchy for us to suddenly have something that’d stop him from reading our minds.</p>
<p>（Already too late. Identity as intellegent weapon already exposed.）</p>
<p>『Hmm. Is it really too late?』</p>
<p>（Nn. Justification, can just say used Master’s ability. Master just that amazing.）</p>
<p>『Seriously?』</p>
<p>（Nn. Since Intelligent Weapon.）</p>
<p>You know, now that I think about it, I might actually be pretty awesome. The fact that I knew about the Divine Blades had always made me think of myself as an inferior good. I mean, I at least had enough confidence to think if I’d be targeted if people found out about me, but that was pretty much it. Reflecting on it from a more logical standpoint made me actually seem rather desirable, as Intelligent Weapons were better than Magic Swords, but not as good as Divine Blades.</p>
<p>In other words, the fact that I was an intelligent weapon could actually be used as a pretty decent arbitrary excuse for when we wanted to just bullshit through things. People wouldn’t really find it odd because of how strange Intelligent Weapons were in the first place.</p>
<p>『True true.』</p>
<p>Eh, yeah, I was convinced that there weren’t any detriments to actually going through with it, so I used up 18 of my self evolution points and just flat out maxed the skill.</p>
<p>〈Thought Isolation has reached its maximum level. It has evolved into the the Perfect Thought Isolation skill.〉</p>
<p>Oh shit! The skill evolved? Sweet, Perfect Thought Isolation sounds hella awesome. Mind reading? Induced Thought? Come at me bro, I got this. The best part about the skill was that I could adjust the extent to which I blocked my thoughts out. I could use it to mess with people that could read minds by only allowing them to read specific thoughts.</p>
<p>（Other skills, what to do?）</p>
<p>『Would probably be better for us to just hold onto them for now and think things through a bit more carefully first.』</p>
<p>I had a limited number of points, so it’d be best for me to be a bit more prudent in their use.</p>
<p>『Let’s think carefully about how we want to use them.』</p>
<p>（Nn. Got it.）</p>
<p>I was thinking of leveling up the Divine Sword Arts skill myself, but I didn’t really mind relinquishing the points to some other skill if Fran wanted to, seeing as how she was the one that was going to be using them and all.</p>
<p>That was especially true because of the fact that she was more creative than me. She came up with some pretty interesting stuff back when we were fighting Rynford, so I was really looking forward to seeing what she’d be able to think of and pull off in the future.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Erza stopped just a bit before we arrived at the guild.</p>
<p>「Hmph. It’s started getting really crowded. Everyone's in our way.」</p>
<p>There were a lot more people here than there were where we were a few minutes ago. To make matters worse, they weren’t just walking along or anything either. They’d all gathered up in a crowd, which in turn made it more difficult for us to get through them.</p>
<p>『You think something happened?』</p>
<p>「Erza. Something happened?」</p>
<p>「It seems like a bunch of high ranking foreign nobles have just arrived in town. They’re here to watch the Martial Arts Tournament because it’s coming up soon. It’s just going to keep getting worse from here on out because we’ll be getting a huge influx of nobles and adventurers. Everything always gets really crowded around this time of year. It’s Ulmutt’s busiest season.」</p>
<p>Ohhhhh. So the nobles are taking up basically the whole road and making everyone else sit off to the side while they do? I guess that means it’s kinda like, but not as bad as the old Japanese Daimyo stuff they used to do; everyone here has to just sit and wait until they’re through.</p>
<p>「I think we should just take the high road from here.」</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>I looked down on the crowd from Fran’s back as she leapt onto the rooftop</p>
<p>In doing so, I saw the most extravagant looking carriage I’d ever seen since reincarnating. The wooden lion stuck on its roof looked so real that could honestly see it coming to life at any given moment. Its body was crafted of a lustrous ebony, and its ornaments a gaudy mix of gold and silver. Much to my surprise, its near excessive decorations didn’t make it look vulgar or over the top, but instead caused it to give off an elegant air.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>Even a single glance was enough for me to tell that they weren’t just your everyday low end nobles.</p>
<p>The only thing I didn’t get was why they had so few escorts. Their carriage looked like something that’d normally be accompanied by dozens of guards.</p>
<p>I actually couldn’t believe that it was totally exposed to danger save for the coachman and the pair of guards that stood to its left and right. It wasn’t even a part of a caravan or anything like that either. I knew that we were in a in town right now and all that, but still, weren’t the people inside of the damn thing being you know, a bit too careless?</p>
<p>Or so I thought… until I observed the coachman and the carriage's two guards in more detail.</p>
<p>『Damn, they look strong.』</p>
<p>Just looking at the way they carried themselves made me intuitively realize that they were extremely capable.</p>
<p>『Hmmm, I should be able to get away with it if I do it right now…』</p>
<p>I wanted to appraise all three of the people outside the carriage, but Fran was moving too quickly, and made it so I was only capable of appraising one of the two guards.</p>
<p>『Whaaaa?』</p>
<p>（Master. Problem?）</p>
<p>『Nothing really important. Just that carriage’s guard is hella stronk.』</p>
<p>I knew he’d be strong, but I’d never been expecting him to be <i>that</i> strong.</p>

<p>Shit, he’s an A ranked adventurer, and an evolved beastkin too. He was just as strong as Amanda. Were the other two like that too? I guess that explains their lack of other guards. They literally don’t need them. Actually, having three people that strong is already just flat out excessive. The three of them would honestly probably be able to just totally roll the entire city of Ulmutt all on their own.</p>
<p>Fran turned back in excitement the moment I told her about him.</p>
<p>（Amazing! Rhino tribe famous for strength, but few in number.）</p>
<p>『Wow, really?』</p>
<p>You know, thinking about it, this is actually my first time seeing any rhino beastkin, which kinda makes sense if they’re really rare. That said, the guy just kinda just looks like a human with a big frame.</p>
<p>Both the Super Herculean Strength and Vigour Mastery skills caught my interest.</p>
<p>I didn’t get to appraise either skill, but I figured they were the respective upgrades to Herculean Strength and Vigour Manipulation. I was interested in his innate skills as well, but I couldn’t appraise or intuit either, so they were left as unknowns for the time being.</p>
<p>We might be able to find the answer if we do a bit of research at the guild or ask Aurel or something. He’s got a tonne of experience, so he might no. Moreover, there’s actually a fair chance he might have some info on the person himself as well.</p>
<p>（Nn. Will ask!）</p>
<p>It seemed Fran herself was totally on board and going full steam ahead.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><strong>170. Dias’ Secret</strong></p>
<p>Dias greeted us with a surprised look on his face upon our return to the guild and ascent into his room.</p>
<p>「You’ve already beat the boss? That was pretty quick.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>It seemed he didn’t expect us to already be done with the place, which I guess did make sense seeing as how we were training and all that. It probably would’ve taken like twice as long if not for my ability to level up skills through the absorption of magic stones.</p>
<p>「Message from Rumina. Fulfill contract.」</p>
<p>「Oh my. Who’s Rumina?」</p>
<p>「Sorry Erza, that’s a bit of a secret.」</p>
<p>Apparently everything about Rumina was supposed to be a secret kept even from Erza.</p>
<p>Whoops…</p>
<p>「Mmkay. Don't worry, I get it.」</p>
<p>「Sorry. Thanks.」</p>
<p>「Teehee. A good woman is one that doesn’t ask too many questions.」</p>
<p>Erza seemed to catch onto to what was going on and dropped the topic immediately after winking. His quick response seemed to stem from the fact that he was completely aware of the difference in status between him and the Guildmaster, and that he wasn’t qualified to listen in on what we almost started discussing.</p>
<p>It’d be better for us to just move on to the next topic for the time being.</p>
<p>「Finished several requests.」</p>
<p>「I see. What exactly have you finished? We might as well verify it all now.」</p>
<p>「This, this…」</p>
<p>Fran pulled out all the sheets representing requests she'd completed. She first started with the 9 kill quests before working her way into the fetch quests. Unfortunately, it didn’t seem like we managed to hit the 23 quest threshold Dias had told us we needed.</p>
<p>「Mind showing me your dungeon card?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Here.」</p>
<p>「Hmmm, these are some nice results. You really have finished all the kill quests.」</p>
<p>「Wow Fran, you’re so awesome. Mhmm, yes you are~」</p>
<p>Dias and Erza were both surprised by the results shown on Fran’s dungeon card, as it informed them of all the magic beasts she’d slain.</p>
<p>Apparently, it was normal for adventurers to avoid battle if possible. We, on the other hand, did the exact opposite and basically mowed down everything in our way, so we ended up killing a tonne more monsters than they’d been expecting.</p>
<p>「Wow Fran! Even a whole party of D rankers would normally struggle to kill this many. Mhmm.」</p>
<p>「You should have enough materials to finish quite a few of your fetch quests too, right? Have you dismantled everything already?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Done already.」</p>
<p>「Could you put everything over there then?」</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>Erza had already laid out a vinyl-like sheet for us to put stuff on so that we wouldn’t dirty the floor with blood or whatever.</p>
<p>We laid our materials up on top of it, starting with the High Ogre’s horns and the Mimic Venom Crawler’s poison sacks. Erza was watching, so we made sure we made it look like we were taking things out of the cloth bag Fran had as opposed to my storage space.</p>
<p>Fran treated the poison sack with great care. Neither Erza nor Dias would probably die even if we messed up and popped the thing, but it’d still be a pain in the ass to clean up after. They’d probably still get mad at us anyways too.</p>
<p>「They’re in good condition and of a pretty high quality. Do you want to them them all in for your quests?」</p>
<p>「Yes.」</p>
<p>「All in all, you’ve completed a total of 17 quests. Actually, 18 counting the boss’ subjugation. You’ll be able to rank up if you do 5 more.」</p>
<p>「You’re so close! Just a little bit more effort and you’ll be there Fran!」</p>
<p>That posed us a bit of a problem. The only quests we had left required us to hunt rarer magic beasts like Dirty Wisps. It’d take us quite a bit of time to actually go through and get everything we needed.</p>
<p>Them being rare was bad enough, so the fact that they were also stealthy made finding them a nightmare. It was much harder for us to home in on them than it was for us to just kill whatever came at us.</p>
<p>We might end up having to spend even longer in the dungeon than we had last time.<br>
。<br>
Oh well, whatever. We can figure that out after we check in with Aurel. The tourney’s coming up, and there’s a chance we might actually have to wait till after it’s done to actually dive back into the dungeon and get the stuff we need to rank up.</p>
<p>Dias sank into thought as Fran informed him of her plans.</p>
<p>「Hmm… So you’d like to rank up as quickly as possible?」</p>
<p>「Mmmm, I don’t really think it’s necessary. You’re already really well known for all the stuff you’ve done, so I don’t think there’ll really be anyone wanting to pick any fights with you anymore.」</p>
<p>Erza judged that it wasn't needed, but Dias offered a contrasting opinion.</p>
<p>「That may be true for now, but I doubt it’ll apply for the adventurers that’ll be entering the city in the coming days.」</p>
<p>「Trueee.」</p>
<p>「I guess that’s why she wants to rank herself up as soon as possible.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Again, there was something pretty important that was stopping us from running back into the dungeon and ranking up.</p>
<p>「Want to participate in tournament.」</p>
<p>You had to sign up at the Adventurer’s Guild, the Arena, or one of the many other venues set throughout the city unless you had a letter of recommendation. Said sign up started in three days.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>Anyone that signed up would be refused unless they went in person and presented their papers. Registration by proxy was simply disallowed.</p>
<p>「Oh, don’t worry about that. I can just hold onto your application for you.」</p>
<p>「But need to sign up in person.」</p>
<p>「You see, the guild’s actually got a fair number of recommendations left over, and we don’t see any reason not to hand one to a competent C ranked adventurer.」</p>
<p>Is that… really okay? Isn’t getting recommended by the guild kinda like a really big deal? It means effectively functioning as the guild’s representative, right? Don’t you need to not only be strong but also really polite and stuff?</p>
<p>「Don’t worry about the technicalities, administrative stuff or anything else. We’re the ones that asked you to rank yourself up in the first place, so there’s no harm in us doing you a favour or two in exchange. We’ll handle everything, so feel free to just go hole yourself up in the dungeon some more and get all your stuff done with.」</p>
<p>Dias was acting suspicious. I couldn’t wrap my head around why he was treating us the way he was. I mean, I knew we had connections, and that both Amanda and Klimut were backing us, but he was still treating us way better than he should given that we were just D rankers. It was almost like he was doing everything he could to get us to go to and stay inside of the dungeon.</p>
<p>「Dias. Acting weird?」</p>
<p>「Hahaha, what’re you talking about? I’m just acting the same way I always do.」</p>
<p>「Really weird.」</p>
<p>「I agree with Fran. It seems like you’re a teensy bit rushed. It’s kinda like you’re up to something.」</p>
<p>Likewise, Erza also seemed to have realized that the old man wasn’t acting as he usually would, and ended up tilting his head in confusion.</p>
<p>「You’re just imagining things.」</p>
<p>「Are you trying to play some sort of prank on Fran again?」</p>
<p>「Again?」</p>
<p>「Nah, no way.」</p>
<p>Yeahhhhh, he’s definitely up to something, but I don’t think he’s about to let us in on what that something is no matter how much we poke at him, least not right now. I was stuck trying to think of some sort of solution, or at least I was until I saw Erza bring his face right up to Dias’ before speaking in a quiet tone of voice.</p>
<p>「I knew it. You really are up to something.」</p>
<p>「H-hahaha, you sure seem confident.」</p>
<p>「Call it the result of a woman’s intuition!」</p>
<p>So uh… I decided to set aside the idea of how reliable Erza’s “womanly intuition” would be and focused on something a bit more important: the fact that Erza, who’d known Dias for quite a long time, asserted that he was probably up to something, then he was probably up to something.</p>
<p>I guess it’d probably be best for us to play our trump card then.</p>
<p>『Fran, use <i>that.</i>』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran pulled out Klimut’s letter and held it up as if she was showing it off. That, of course, wasn’t enough on its own, so she threw in a few extra lines for added effect.</p>
<p>「Dias. Speak truth.」</p>
<p>「H-haha… I don’t know what you’re talking about.」</p>
<p>Dias’ fear of Klimut was immediately demonstrated as his eyes began wavering the moment he saw the letter.</p>
<p>「Can tell you’re hiding something.」</p>
<p>「Oh come on… I swear you’re just imagining things.」</p>
<p>His voice wavered as well. Yeah, okay, I’m convinced now. He was definitely hiding something, and all we needed to figure out what that something was one last push.</p>
<p>「Will tell Klimut and Amanda that was pranked by Dias.」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry! I’m really sorry!」</p>
<p>The old Guildmaster leapt straight into the air before landing in a stance indicative of nothing but prostration. Yeah, gotta give it to him. He’s really got the physical capabilities of an A ranked adventurer. The fact that he flew over his huge ass desk made it a 10/10 performance.</p>
<p>「I’m really, really sorry!」</p>
<p>「W-What just happened? Just what is that thing?」</p>
<p>Erza’s eyes moved between Fran and Dias; the look on his face was one of clear confusion. The sight of an old man grinding his face into the ground whilst prostrating to a child was one that could bring a grown man to tears, so his confusion was only justified, especially seeing as it all happened just cause said old man happened to see a certain letter.</p>
<p>「Erza. This branch, any Carrier Hawks?」</p>
<p>「Yuppers.」</p>
<p>「Nn. First, will send letter to Klimut…」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m really, really, really sorry. Please, anything but that.」</p>
<p>You know, he’d probably suffer a social death if word got out that he tried to play a prank on a little girl. Telling Amanda, however, would probably result in him experiencing an actual death.</p>
<p>「Then tell everything.」</p>
<p>「Alright. Maaaan, you’re so mean. Have you no mercy? I did so much for you too.」</p>
<p>We decided to wait till after we heard his case before we finally gave him a verdict.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>
		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>171. The Beast Lord</b></p>
<p>「Are you aware of the fact that a large number of nobles have been visiting the city as of late?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We kinda just saw them on our way over, so yeah.</p>
<p>「One of the visitors I just mentioned happens to have a special sort of status.」</p>
<p>「Special status?」</p>
<p>「Well, let’s just say said person happens to be the Beast Lord.」</p>
<p>「Really!? Wow, we’ve got some big names here this year.」</p>
<p>Erza’s expression changed into one of honest surprise. It seemed that the Beast Lord was apparently someone famous.</p>
<p>「Big name?」</p>
<p>「Oh my. I guess that means you must not know much about the Beast Lord.」</p>
<p>「Only heard name before.」</p>
<p>I haven’t.</p>
<p>「Well, you’re a beastkin yourself, so I think it you should learn a bit more about it. Mhmm.」</p>
<p>The Beast Lord was apparently a self-evident name; it was the title granted to the person that ruled over the Beastkin’s Country. The Beast Lord stood above all tribes and was respected by all beastkin regardless of whether or not they were the lord’s countrymen. Its influence was so great that it held notable power within every single nation.</p>
<p>The Beastkin’s Country itself was located on another one of the world’s continent, but considered the Kingdom of Kranzel friendly regardless. The lord has been known to visit Ulmutt in order to watch it’s famed Martial Arts Tournament once every few years as a show of goodwill.</p>
<p>「And this year just happens to be one of those years.」</p>
<p>「Well, you sure make it sound like you don’t like the Beast Lord’s visits.」</p>
<p>「That’d be because I already have enough on my plate. This year’ll be especially busy with Fran here.」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>What’s that supposed to mean? We’d never met anyone like the Beast Lord before, so why’s this sound like it’s supposed to be some sort of big deal that relates to us?</p>
<p>「You see, it was said that the Blue Cat Tribe was the first to sell the Black Cat Tribe into slavery, but some say that their actions had actually been ones ordered by the Beast Lord. Typically speaking, the Beast Lord is chosen from amongst the Red Cat Tribe, or more specifically, their evolved members, the Golden Lionkin. The Blue Cat Tribe is known for taking action as under the Beast Lord’s orders..」</p>
<p>「Wow, really? I never knew.」</p>
<p>「That’d be because it’s been considered a part of one of history’s darker canals. Not even the citizens of the Beastkin’s Country actively seek discussion about the topic.」</p>
<p>It seemed that Fran hadn’t know much about what was said either, as she was listening to Dias with an earnest look on her face.</p>
<p>「I don’t really think I need to say this because it’s rather obvious, but it’s been a long time since the Black Catkin were first sold into slavery, and the Beast Lord that ruled back then has long died. Though, they do say that the Blue Cat Tribe still does function as one of the Beast Lord’s agents.」</p>
<p>Which means that it’s possible that the Black Cat Tribe had been enslaved because the Beast Lord had willed it.</p>
<p>You know, thinking about it, that does actually seem quite possible. That kinda stuff happened back in my world too. History was stained with acts in which people used others as scapegoats and forced them into slavery and the other poor social circumstances in order to use them as scapegoats and appease the masses.</p>
<p>Selling off the Black Cat Tribe’s members not only created said scapegoat and abated the common folk's dissatisfaction, but also also allowed the country to gain access to foreign currencies.</p>
<p>The Black Cat Tribe’s members basically filled the role perfectly too, seeing as how they were both weak and unable to evolve.<br>
「The current Beast Lord is especially unpopular. They pried the role from their predecessor in what may as well have been a coup d’etat.」</p>
<p>「Oh, I heard about that too. They say the newest Beast Lord is a parricidal thief.」</p>
<p>「I can’t imagine a person like that having any good impressions on the Black Cat Tribe. In fact, it’ll more likely than not be the opposite.」</p>
<p>That… was some pretty important but bad news. It meant we had to be on guard around basically all other beastkin.</p>
<p>（Beast Lord…）</p>
<p>『You think the Beast Lord might’ve been in the carriage we saw just a bit ago?』</p>
<p>I recalled the carriage and the ridiculously powerful guards that protected it. Yeah, that kinda looked like it was probably the Beast Lord’s carriage. The Beast Lord being some sort of Lionkin explained the lion that decorated the carriage’s top. Ugh, what a pain. The Beast Lord was a foe we wouldn't be able to overcome, be it through political power or brute force. It was also supposedly an evolved beastkin, so I didn’t really think we’d be able to win in a fight if it came down to it. That said, it wasn’t like we already knew for a fact that the Beast Lord would actually antagonize us.</p>
<p>（Then… Assassinate?）</p>
<p>『Just… no. You’re being way too over the top as far as the violence goes. The Beast Lord might not end up antagonizing us at all.』</p>

</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>Aw crap. It looks like Fran’d already been convinced that the Beast Lord was basically Hitler. I best be on my toes if we ever run into it. I’m pretty sure Fran wouldn’t like just suddenly attempt murder, but you know, just in case, right?</p>
<p>「The Beast Lord may end up taking an interest in you if they happen to catch wind of you, and let’s just say I can’t imagine anything good coming out of that.」</p>
<p>「So you want her to stay in the dungeon so she can avoid meeting the Beast Lord?」</p>
<p>「Exactly. We can also protect her by giving her designated requests if she manages to hit C rank before the tournament starts.」</p>
<p>「Designated Requests?」</p>
<p>I’d never heard of them, so we ended up having Erza explain the fact that they were basically requests the guild would offer to specific adventurers.</p>
<p>Designated requests tended to be of high importance and taking on one went hand in hand with receiving every last bit of support the guild was capable of providing. Hence, messing with an adventurer working on a designated request was more or less equivalent with messing with the guild itself. That, by extension, meant that Fran would effectively remain under the guild’s protection so long as she was on a designated request.</p>
<p>There kinda wasn’t anyone brave enough to pick a fight with guild, seeing as it not only spanned what was basically the entire world, but also helped maintain the populace’s everyday lives. The sheer amount of influence the guild held would then make it possible for it to function like a shield that’d stop Fran from being put under the influence of the Beast King’s authority.</p>
<p>「I don’t really think you can just kinda give out designated requests all willy nilly though, can you?」</p>
<p>「I’ve already got that covered. All I have to do is give her a designated request associated with the dungeon. I’m basically the only person the Dungeon Master is willing to negotiate with, so I can just say she’s helping me look for something the Dungeon Master wants.」</p>
<p>「Ohhh~ So that’s why you want to get her promoted. Mhmm, I get it now. It’s because designated requests can only be given to adventurers that are at least C ranked.」</p>
<p>「Exactly.」</p>
<p>Huh, I guess that means he really was just doing everything he was doing for Fran’s sake this whole time. I had to say, it really was hard for us to believe him because of how shady he was. In fact, I probably still wouldn’t believe him if I hadn’t the Principality of Falsehood.</p>
<p>「Why didn’t you just tell her everything from the start?」</p>
<p>「I was worried she’d take an interest in the Beast Lord if she learned the truth.」</p>
<p>Well uh, can’t say he’s wrong, seeing as she kinda did exactly that.</p>
<p>「And that, Fran, is why I’m asking you to raise your rank as soon as possible.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>「Try your best to get it done before the Martial Arts Tournament. As I said earlier, I’ll get you a recommendation, so you at least won’t have to worry about that.」</p>
<p>「Don’t need recommendation.」</p>
<p>「Really? Why’s that? It’ll get you seeded so you can skip the prelims, you know?」</p>
<p>「Want to participate in prelims.」</p>
<p>「But Fran, the prelims are completely random. You might end up having to fight someone really strong.」</p>
<p>「Don’t care.」</p>
<p>To Fran, the Martial Arts Tournament was effectively an effect in which she’d have a chance to fight a bunch of people.</p>
<p>「T-That’s fine. I can make it so you get registered like any other person and can take part in the prelims.」</p>
<p>「You sure do like fighting, Fran. Ermagawd, that part of you is just so adorable~」</p>
<p>It seemed like Dias was willing to comply with our request as he deemed it dangerous for Fran to meet the Beast Lord. He was all for having us hole ourselves up in the dungeon so we could rank ourselves up while also avoiding the worst possible scenario. I got that and all, but I still couldn’t help but feel that he was acting suspiciously.</p>
<p>「Why going so far?」</p>
<p>Fran’s question hit the nail on the head and got to the exact thing that resulted in me feeling all suspicious. I understood that Dias, as Guildmaster, was obligated to protect the adventurers that worked under him. Still, I failed to see why he would go this far for us.</p>
<p>「I’ve got my reasons. For now, let’s just say it’s to fulfill a promise I happened to make with a certain someone.」</p>
<p>Oh. I get it now. It must’ve been because of that contrat Rumina asked him to fulfill. Its contents probably mentioned touched on having dias do his best to help any Black Catkin he happened across. This was further evidenced by his lack of ability to name her seeing as how Erza was still present.</p>
<p>「Do thank her next time you two meet.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>「What’s this? You two have got some sort of secret going? I’m soooo jealous.」</p>
<p>Well, we kinda are heading back to the dungeon anyways, so we might as well do that while we’re at it. She really has made life a lot more convenient for us, after all.</p>

		<p><b>172. The Black Cat<br>
</b><br>
The Disaster Pillbug’s corpse was kinda a bit too big to fit in the Guildmaster’s room, so we dumped it in the dismantling room together with all our other non-quest related materials. This action also served a second purpose. One of the guild's clerks would be helping us evaluate its worth.</p>
<p>I was a bit worried as to whether or not we’d actually be able to sell it seeing as how it wasn’t dismantled, but I soon recalled that the guild did actually offer a dismantling service, albeit at a bit of a price.</p>
<p>According to Erza, the fee for said service wasn’t fixed. It could vary based on how large and difficult to dismantle the magic beast in question happened to be.</p>
<p>「Hmmm… I don’t think it’ll cost you any more than 40k Golde. I think they only charged The Hundred Blade about 40k-50k for the B ranked Lesser Dragon he brought in that one time. Do you know about him? Hundred Blade Forrund, I mean.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Met in Barbra.」</p>
<p>「Wow! I’m so jealous! He’s soooo cool! I just can’t help but look up to him. Don’t you think so too, Fran?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Very strong. Will become that strong too someday.」</p>
<p>「That’s not what I mean! Come on Fran, don’t you think he’s really hot and dreamy? He’s just my type.」</p>
<p>Erza started doing the usual thing and twisting his body back and forth whilst wearing an expression you probably wouldn’t expect to see on anything other than a maiden in love. Honestly, at this point, I’d already gotten so used to him that he actually started kind of looking like a girl. Kinda.</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「Oh, how I’d love for him to embrace me with his thick burly arms while whispering words of love.」</p>
<p>Welp. Sure sucks to be Forrund right now. I actually just flat out feel sorry for him. You know, this is probably the first time I’ve ever felt any sympathy for any sort of super good looking guy. I guess being attractive isn’t without its detriments after all.</p>
<p>Erza's words were explicit, but Fran didn’t really seem to catch his drift regardless.</p>
<p>『I guess you might as well just nod along for now.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Oh, you see where I’m coming from, Fran?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「He sure is hot, isn’t he?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「It looks like we might just have similar tastes in men.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran casually nodded along and affirmed Erza’s statements as brought out the materials she wanted to sell.</p>
<p>The staff member responsible for appraising the items Fran was selling had a look on his face that almost made it seem as if he’d completely lost all faith in humanity. He simply had nothing to say, and didn’t know how to feel. On his left was a homo wriggling his body back and forth as he acted like a girl in love. On his right was a small child diligently sorting a whole slew of materials without even the slightest change in expression.</p>
<p>「Take pillbug out here too?」</p>
<p>「Huh? What? O-Oh, yeah, sure.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran dumped the Disaster Pillbug’s corpse onto the floor. It had yet to be dismantled, so it was in the exact same state it’d been in right after its death. The room was immediately filled with a putrid stench as a result. It was one born from a mix of the creature’s electric burns and the simple unpleasant odor its body’s fluids happened to give off. Speaking of which, said fluid had yet to stop dripping out from within the insect’s open wounds.</p>
<p>Insect-type magic beasts had the tendency to be much more grotesque than their beast-like counterparts, and this one in particular was especially so as a result of its massive size. In fact, it was so much more disgusting than usual that even the clerk in charge of dismantling ended up grimacing in response.</p>
<p>Despite that though, the clerk ended up approaching it. Wow. I really had to give it to him. Dude was one hell of a professional.</p>
<p>He, however, was pretty much the only man present capable of really keeping his cool. A certain other person happened to freak the hell out.</p>
<p>「Gyaaah!」</p>
<p>「Erza?」</p>
<p>「Eeeeeeeeeekkkkkk!」</p>
<p>The sudden throaty scream had sounded so panicked that I’d almost thought something serious had happened.</p>
<p>「Something wrong?」</p>
<p>「T-There’s a bug!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Pillbug.」</p>
<p>「H-Hiiiiii!!」</p>
<p>Erza’s face paled as he clasped both hands to his chest and started trembling in terror. His legs were shaking in much the same manner as those of a newly born deer.</p>
<p>The immediate conclusion I made was that Erza just wasn't a bug person. He didn't seem capable of handling them, and that was that. The pillbug's ridiculous size didn't really help his case either. In fact, it probably was doing the exact opposite.</p>
<p>The specific emotion reflected in his eyes wasn't disgust, but rather terror. God, is he actually supposed to be some sort of pure maiden? Er, I guess he does have a heart like one, soooo…</p>
<p>「Nn? Erza?」</p>
<p>「Aaahhh…」</p>
<p>Fran, on the other hand, didn’t actually seem to have a particular disdain for any sort of creature whatsoever. She stared at Erza with a confused look on her face; she seemed not to have even the slightest bit of an understanding of the other party’s fear of bugs.</p>
<p>Erza's screams started escalating in volume in the meantime, and his face had began warping to an even greater degree. That said though, his was no longer the face that contained in it the most fear. The clerk had gotten extremely pale for some odd reason, but spoke in as comforting a tone as he could manage regardless.</p>
<p>「P-Please calm down Erza! That isn’t a bug!」</p>
<p>「I-It totally is!」</p>
<p>「It just happens to resemble one. That’s it!」</p>
<p>「I don’t believe you! It has to be a bug!」</p>
<p>「J-Just think about it for a second. T-There’s no way a bug that big could actually exist.」</p>
<p>「Big bug…? Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!」</p>
<p>「Aw shit!」</p>
<p>「Uguguguguguuuu!!!」</p>
<p>「Craap! Hey, you! Can you move that thing somewhere else? Like right now? Please?」</p>
<p>『Shove it in storage for now. I’m pretty sure the whole situation will spiral out of control if you don’t.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran still didn’t understand exactly what had happened, but she abided by the man's request and immediately shoved the pillbug into storage as she had at least got the fact that something was wrong given that Erza had started tensing up.</p>
<p>「Everything’s okay Erza! It’s not here anymore!」</p>
<p>「W-Where’d the bug go…?」</p>
<p>「Gone.」</p>
<p>「M-Mkay…」</p>
<p>The tension that’d filled the air around Erza dispersed as he fell flat on his butt. Seeing said action caused the clerk in charge of dismantling to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>「W-Whew. Thanks.」</p>
<p>「What happened to Erza?」</p>
<p>「Well, you see, Erza isn’t exactly comfortable around anything that resembles an insect. She gets so terrified of them that they make her go berserk. The rampage that ensues tends to produce some pretty terrible results, as she’s still capable of using her skills quite masterfully even when not fully conscious.」</p>
<p>「Any problems in dungeons?」</p>
<p>「Kinda, yeah.」</p>
<p>Erza was still just as capable of making use of his abilities when in his berserked state, so he wouldn’t die or anything, but that didn’t mean he was problem free. Not being in control meant that he would not only cause damage through friendly fire, but also completely obliterate any monster-related materials and hence reduce his party’s income.</p>
<p>He could tolerate smaller bugs, but he was known to go crazy if he got surrounded. There’d also been a case in which he went on a rampage after having a cockroach lunge straight at his face.</p>
<p>「One of his incidents had even lead to him sending about 20 of the guild’s clerks to the infirmary.」</p>
<p>「Sounds like dangerous event.」</p>
<p>「That’s cause that’s exactly what it is. Her rampages are so crazy and sudden that even A-rank adventurers find themselves having a fair bit of trouble dealing with them.」</p>
<p>The sudden appearance of a gigantic bug had pretty much put him on the verge of having one of his so called incidents.</p>
<p>「Erza, okay?」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry Fran… I just can’t stand bugs!」</p>
<p>I wanted to ask him the reason for his fears, but refrained because I figured there was a chance that recalling the memory would make him lose it. It looked like just casually pretending nothing ever happened would probably be in our best interest for now.</p>
<p>「Erza, leave room.」</p>
<p>「I’ll do exactly that. Check in with me once you’re done, I’ll go have some tea.」</p>
<p>With Erza’s departure came a wave of silence; we finally found ourselves capable of selling our materials.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>The pillbug sold for a total of 560k Golde. It was considered fairly difficult to dismantle, and thus, cost us about 30k, which meant we made an overall profit of 530k. The fact that it was worth way more than a high ogre’s hide, which averaged in at about 40k a piece, really served to provide a sense of scale and show off just how ridiculously large the Disaster Pillbug really was.</p>
<p>All in all, we’d made a total of 800k Golde since departing Barbra.</p>
<p>I wasn’t really sure how we should feel. It felt like we were earning ourselves a bunch of money really easily, but it also kind of felt like we’d kind of put our lives on the line at the same time, so I couldn’t really tell if it was worth it. Oh well, whatever works, I guess.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>「Are you all done now, Fran?」</p>
<p>We found Erza doing exactly what he said he’d be doing after we finished selling everything. He was sitting at the guild’s bar, drinking a cup of tea together with an old man. The teapot he was using seemed rather stylish, whereas the cup was adored with a bit of a floral design. The tea was accompanied by a snack consisting of scones. The hell? Are we in a goddamn cafe or something?</p>
<p>「Done.」</p>
<p>「Would you like some too?」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>「I have red tea, black tea, and ulm tea. Which would you like?」</p>
<p>「That many choices?」</p>
<p>「Mhmm. I recommend scones for the red tea, cookies for the black tea, and pie for the ulm tea. 」</p>
<p>「…Will have all.」</p>
<p>「Oh my. Can you really eat that much?」</p>
<p>「Can.」</p>
<p>「Alright then. You heard the girl.」</p>
<p>「Sure did.」</p>
<p>The bartender had an old gentlemanly look to him. He didn’t fit in with his rowdy surroundings. Fran seemed to feel the same way, as she had her head tilted in confusion.</p>
<p>「This place. Bar?」</p>
<p>「Mhmm.」</p>
<p>「Hahaha. I get that quite often. I can assure you that it is. However, I’ve started to stock a wider variety of tea and snacks at Erza’s request.」</p>
<p>「Teehee. That’d be because the tea you make is always really delicious, which is also why I tend to punish everyone that troubles you just a teensy bit more than I normally would. Doing so teaches them just how great tea can be too. I think it’s become just about as popular as the alcoholic drinks you serve, right?」</p>
<p>「That’s in part due to the rumours about how much you and the Guildmaster hate drinking. A fair number of our clients tend to pick tea over alcohol if either of the two of you are present.」</p>
<p>I guess it does only make sense for people to have an aversion to the stuff if the guild’s two most influential figures have a dislike for it. In that sense, I guess you could say that Erza, like Dias, was abusing his power to do whatever he wanted. Er, actually I guess that’s not quite right. It’s more like he’s throwing around the influence brought about by people’s fear of and respect for him.</p>
<p>「Here’s your first cup of tea, and a few snacks. I’ve started you off with the red tea.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran took a scone in each hand and devoured the entire plate’s worth in an instant. I’m not even actually sure when it happened, but, she also somehow managed to down a tonne of cream and jam as well.</p>
<p>Erza enjoyed his team in a much more elegant manner as he watched over Fran with a smile. His hands were posed exactly as they should’ve been; his pinky was sticking up and out. The sheer refinement of his mannerisms almost seemed to serve as a testament to the fact that he was really girly.</p>
<p>I was a bit worried about what the old man sitting across from us would think poorly of Fran as a result of her poor mannerisms, but that fortunately didn’t end up being the case. He was instead gazing at her endearingly, as he likely would his own grandchild.</p>
<p>If I was to judge his occupation purely off his attire, I’d probably assume him to be some sort of adventurer.</p>
<p>「Fuofuofuo. The healthiest children are the ones with healthiest appetites..」</p>
<p>「Who?」</p>
<p>「Oh, excuse me, I must’ve forgotten to introduce myself. My name is Radyer, a mere C ranked adventurer.」</p>
<p>「He’s known for being Ulmutt’s oldest adventurer.」</p>
<p>The fact that he was a white haired magician instantly made me assume that he was someone really strong. I was basically completely convinced that his rank was lower than it should’ve been despite the vast extent of his experience because his body had gotten old and frail. I was also more or less sure of the fact that he used his wisdom and knowledge to compensate for his weaknesses.</p>
<p>「He’s actually realllly strong. He’d be a B ranker if not for the sheer amount of time he spent as a court magician.」</p>
<p>「I’m fairly disheartened by the fact that you didn’t claim me to be on par with an A ranker instead.」</p>
<p>「Well, that’d be because A ranked adventurers are far out of the norm.」</p>
<p>「That aside, Black Catkin adventurers sure are quite rare, aren’t they?」</p>
<p>Radyer’s evaluating gaze seemed to carry with it a hint of nostalgia.</p>
<p>「It’s been about fifty years since I’ve last seen one, hasn’t it?」</p>
<p>「Hmmm? Fran isn’t the only Black Catkin adventurer around, you know? We’ve got quite the number of them. In fact, they make up many of our new recruits.」</p>
<p>「If you’re talking in technical terms and including all Black Catkin that are adventurers, then yes. But, there aren’t any others this young or capable.」</p>
<p>「Well, I guess that is true. So you’re saying that there was another Black Catkin like Fran about fifty years ago?」</p>
<p>「There was. The lass here is nearly identical to the one I met back then. They’ve the same black hair and the same curt manner of speech. I can’t recall her name, but I can still vividly recall the sharpness of her gaze.」</p>
<p>Radyer closed his eyes and stroked his beard in order to better recall his distant memories.</p>
<p>「I think she said she was 15. I also recall that she liked to solo, and would treat those that insulted her tribe without even the slightest shred of mercy. She would also attack Blue Catkin adventurers and violently perform acts of retribution. I believe she would cut off their tails as if it was nobody’s business.」</p>
<p>「She really does sound just like Fran.」</p>
<p>「Doesn’t she? I believe she used to be called The Black Cat. There used to be a rumour that said any that involved themselves with The Black Cat would but lose their lives.」</p>
<p>「That person, where now?」</p>
<p>「I have no idea. She just suddenly vanished one day. I’ve no idea as to whether she died, or simply happened to leave town.」</p>
<p>「Oh…」</p>
<p>If she was really that strong, then she, like Fran, had probably been seeking evolution. If this all happened 50 years ago, then there’s actually a chance she’s still alive. I’d like for us to talk to her and have her tell us everything she’s learned. I’m also a bit curious about the part where she just upped and vanished.</p>
<p>「The reason I don’t know is because The Black Cat and I weren’t what one could call intimate. Aurel, one of my old party members, however, might.」</p>
<p>「That sounds just perfect. The two of us were planning to go see Grandpa Aurel soon anyway. Why do you think he’d know though?」</p>
<p>「There are quite a few reasons. The first is because they’re both beastkin, and the second is because I happened to see them speaking with one another on multiple occasions. The third would likely be because she had apparently saved him once in the past. He warned us not to ever mess with her thereafter. It was a fair warning. I may very well have hit on her given her appearance and how I was in the past.」</p>
<p>「Was The Black Cat really cute?」</p>
<p>「She was. Just between you and me, I’m almost certain that Aurel had fallen for her.」</p>
<p>「Kyaaah!! Wait, does that mean Gramps is a lolicon?」</p>
<p>「No, no, definitely not. He was still in his teens back then. It was way back when he was still known as a genius as a result of the fact that he’d broke the record for being the fastest adventurer to become a D ranker.」</p>
<p>Right. For some odd reason, I’d almost been under the impression that Dias, Aurel and Radyer had just always been old men. I almost forgot that they too had, at one point, been young. You know, to be honest, I can’t even actually imagine them being young. Oh well, either way, I guess we’ve got one more reason to go hit Aurel up now.</p>

		<p><b>173. Maintenance<br>
</b><br>
We decided to stop by that one dwarven blacksmith’s shop before heading over to Aurel’s manor.</p>
<p>「Oh, hey. It’s that little missy Gallus told me to take care of. You need something?」</p>
<p>「Want equipment repaired.」</p>
<p>We hadn’t really bothered getting the Black Cat Set repaired up ’till now ’cause its self-repair function made it so we’d never really needed it. We technically didn’t need it now either, but the pillbug had damaged the equips so badly that they had still yet to fully fix themselves. We’d also kind of never bothered maintaining the armour in any which way either, and figured we might as well.</p>
<p>The Martial Arts Tournament was coming up, so it’d probably be a good idea for us to have our gear in top shape.</p>
<p>「Sure thing! I, Zerld, will fix it right up. They don’t call me Ulmutt’s best blacksmith for nothing.」<br>
Zerld procured a magic crystal and started setting up a magic circle after spending a bit of time inspecting Fran’s gear. Most of the work seemed rather front loaded, as he instantly fixed it by casting Repair immediately after getting everything ready.</p>
<p>The 100k Golde price tag he slapped onto the service was pretty worth; all Fran’s stuff was back in peak condition.</p>
<p>「That’s that. Hand me your sword next.」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「Well, I just thought your sword might be in tatters given how damaged your self-repairing armour was.」</p>
<p>Oh, right. I guess that would normally be how things go, huh? In my case, all the damage I take gets nullified over time by my Self-Repair and Regeneration skills.</p>
<p>「Here.」</p>
<p>『I-I’m perfectly okay. I don’t need any repairs.』</p>
<p>I thought I was fine, but Fran took me off her back and handed me over to Zerld despite my protests.</p>
<p>（But better to have skilled blacksmith check just in case.）</p>
<p>It seemed that Zerld’s words ended up making Fran feel a bit anxious. She herself wasn’t really all that skilled at discerning my condition, and would normally have no choice but to just believe what I told her.</p>
<p>『Oh well. Whatever works, I guess.』</p>
<p>You know what, it might actually not be a bad idea to get a checkup every once in a while. There was always the possibility that there was something off about me, and I just didn’t notice it.</p>
<p>「Hmmm, this sword is made of quite the metal.」</p>
<p>Zerld looked at me from a bunch of different angles before placing me on top of a table and tapping me a few times with a small hammer.</p>
<p>He continued hitting me with the hammer, and sent vibrations through my blade at regular intervals. It was a sensation I honestly couldn’t bring myself to dislike. I could feel the seriousness and earnestly of the dwarven craftsman’s actions, and it was actually honestly quite a comfortable sensation.</p>
<p>He then put me inside a box full of water and shake it lightly before finally polishing me off with a nice clean cloth.</p>
<p>Wew, that felt great. I only barely managed to refrain from letting out a sigh because of how good it felt. The reason I managed to hold back wasn’t something as mundane as wanting to keep my identity from Zerld. It was instead because I didn’t want to moan in response to getting my blade stroked by another man. I’d rather kill myself.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was capable of holding onto my will to live because the pleasure I felt wasn’t sexual in any which way. It was instead more akin to what you’d feel when getting a massage. I guess one could say it didn’t really matter which it was, but the part of me that was a middle aged man insisted otherwise.</p>
<p>I’m not quite sure how it happened, but, Fran somehow managed to catch onto the fact that I was internally gritting my teeth and holding myself back.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>（Master, something wrong?）</p>
<p>『N-Nah, nothing’s wrong.』</p>
<p>（Acting… weird.）</p>
<p>I decided to explain myself to Fran after realizing that I’d worried her for a reason I couldn’t really call anything but ridiculous.</p>
<p>Still, I really had to admit that this felt hella good. Fran always wiped me off as well so I wouldn’t get all dirty and stuff, but she never managed to make it feel <i>this</i> good.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, I’d say that the difference in the sensation stemmed from a difference in skill levels. Reason being that the difference between Zerld’s touch felt like that of a real blacksmith, whereas Fran’s felt like that of an amateur.</p>
<p>「And that’s that. Your blade wasn’t bent or scratched at all, so I just gave it a good old polish.」</p>
<p>Man, that was one helluva polish. Shit was relaxing as hell. I felt like I’d just gone to a super high end bath house, soaked in the water for half a day before getting a massage and sleeping all night. It was like I was totally exhilarated and rejuvenated all at once.</p>
<p>I’d already been in perfect condition to begin with, so that massage had only pushed me further beyond. It felt like I was in absolute peak form and ready to give it my 120%. That said, my stats hadn’t changed at all, so I guess it was more of a mood thing than anything else. I did feel like the internal flow of my magical energy had improved, and that it was a bit easier than usual for me to use skills and whatnot, but I wasn’t sure if that was actually a thing or just some sort of placebo.</p>
<p>「Nn. Blacksmith amazing.」</p>
<p>「Gahahaha. Where’d that come from?」</p>
<p>Fran spoke in a tone filled with admiration as she looked at how shiny my blade had become. You know, I really did feel better than usual. It’d probably be a good idea to do this more often, and not because it felt good!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Okay, well, maybe because it felt good, but you know what? Me being in good shape also means me being able to do more for Fran.</p>
<p>「Later.」</p>
<p>「Sure thing. I’ll do all the maintenance you need, especially seeing as how the tourney’s coming up.」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Not a lot of time had passed despite the fact that a bunch of different things had happened. It was still rather early, so we moved towards Aurel’s manor at a rather leisurely pace.</p>
<p>In fact, Fran had started buying random stuff and just eating it as she slowly walked towards the hill on top of which the mansion was situated.</p>
<p>『These stalls sure are selling a tonne of magic beast meat. I guess that’s just how life goes when you live in a city with two dungeons inside of it.』</p>
<p>Magic beast meat was treated as a luxury good back in Barbra, but here, it was literally all over the place. It was being treated like… well… regular meat.</p>
<p>「Nn. Tasty.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Apparently many of magic beasts one could find in dungeons meant for newbies were actually edible. I couldn’t help but wonder, was that just how it was? Or was it only because of the deals made with the city’s dungeon masters?</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi pretty much picked up food from every single street stall they came across. I’d been expecting them to do the usual thing in which they buy an armful of stuff, but they didn’t actually do that this time around. Instead, they instantly consumed everything they bought.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for us to pass through the residential district and lay eyes on Aurel’s mansion.</p>
<p>『Seems like there’s a lot of people around there.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Lots.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>It looked like 10 odd people were crowded around the manor’s front gate.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>

        
    		
    < /br>

        
		<p><strong>174. Blue Pride</strong></p>
<p>A group of what seemed to be adventurers had gathered in front of Aurel’s manor. I didn’t know exactly who they were or why they were here in the first place, but, I could at least tell that they were only barely organised. They kind of resembled the hoodlums one would normally find loitering around in front of a convenience store. The only two members of the group that looked to have even the slightest bit of decency were the ones I presumed to be their leaders. There was a male and a female, with the latter looking to be around 17 or 18 years old.</p>
<p>I didn’t really get what they were doing; the two were standing right in front of the guards with their arms crossed. It kind of looked like they were waiting on something, but I couldn't really say for sure as to whether or not that was the case.</p>
<p>Looking a bit closer allowed me to realize that the female was some sort of catkin. The same applied to the rest of the group’s members as well.</p>
<p>（Mmph.）</p>
<p>『What’s wrong, Fran?』</p>
<p>（All Blue Catkin.）</p>
<p>『Wait, really? All of them?』</p>
<p>（Nn.）</p>
<p>『I guess we’d best be on guard then,』</p>
<p>（Woof!）</p>
<p>I didn’t think that they’d just attack us out of the blue, but hey, better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Getting through the gate looked to be a huge pain, but I still figured it’d be fine. Aurel was apparently supposed to be really influential amongst beastkin, so I didn’t think we’d have to worry about them trying to pushing through the gate even if the guards did let us in.</p>
<p>『Let’s just ignore them and keep a move on, regardless of what they say.』</p>
<p>（…Got it.）</p>
<p>I was a bit worried despite the fact that Fran had agreed to my suggestion because she had hesitated before replying. Oh well, whatever. I figured I could always just teleport us through the gate If worse came to worst. Aurel seemed to have taken a liking to Fran, so we probably wouldn’t be treated as trespassers or intruders so long as we explained ourselves.</p>
<p>Fran briskly approached the gate whilst keeping her guard up. She made use of the Presence Isolation and Stealth skills in order to make herself as difficult to notice as possible.</p>
<p>The male Blue Catkin were rather weak, so we were able to stop ourselves from attracting their attention so long as we avoided any direct lines of sight.</p>
<p>That, however, was slated to change the moment we actually tried entering the property. We would have to speak with one of the gatekeepers in order to gain access, and doing that would expose us to the teenage girl and her companion.</p>
<p>Oh well. We could probably just ignore them or something.</p>
<p>「Hello.」</p>
<p>「Huh? Oh, hello Fran. Feel free to enter.」</p>
<p>「Allowed to?」</p>
<p>Wait, they let us in? I was expecting them to have to go speak with a few other people and double check stuff first. We’d only ever been here once, so I really wasn’t counting on us being allowed in just like that.</p>
<p>「You are. Master Aurel told us to let you in and prioritize you over all else.」</p>
<p>「The only other person we’ve ever been told to treat like that was Erza.」</p>
<p>Huh, I guess he took much more of a liking to Fran than I’d thought. Well, works for us, I guess.</p>
<p>「Nn. Will be entering then.」</p>
<p>「Please do.」</p>
<p>「Hey, what gives!?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, what the hell is the meaning of this!?」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>Both the male and female blue catkin standing by the gate raised their voices in protest as a result of the fact that Fran had easily been let inside.</p>
<p>The girl’s expression warped from one that seemed to be waiting for something while stumped to one that was more so resembled an antagonizing glare.</p>
<p>「How come she gets to go through like that? Why do we have to wait even though we went out of our way to visit so we could exchange greetings?」</p>
<p>「Do you have any idea how long we’ve been standing out here?」</p>
<p>「I’ve already told you that you can’t meet Master Aurel unless you’ve a prior appointment. You were the ones that insisted you wanted to see him no matter what.」</p>
<p>「Come on! We’re Blue Pride! Don’t you know how famous we are on the the Krohm Continent?」</p>
<p>「I’m our boss’ proxy. Making me wait is basically the same thing as making our boss wait!」</p>
<p>The way they were boasting made it sound like Blue Pride was supposed to be a famous group of mercenaries whose very name inspired fear, which, given that they were from a different continent, could very well be possible.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「I don’t care.」</p>
<p>However, their influence failed to extend past their area of origin. Here, their name seemed to be just like any other, as the gatekeeper just casually shook his head and denied the girl entry, which in turn caused the veins in her forehead to swell in anger. If I were to offer an opinion, I'd say that she was acting in an unbecoming manner. She ended up getting all mad because the gatekeeper had basically ignored her proclamation of how great she supposedly was. The emotional way in which she reacted was one that you really couldn’t call anything but lame.</p>
<p>「We are granting Fran access because she is one of our lord’s honoured guests.」</p>
<p>「Haaah? She’s just a black catkin, and a little girl at that.」</p>
<p>A moment of pondering led me to realize that the group’s name, Blue Pride, indicated that it was probably comprised solely of Blue Catkin, which in turn meant that it’d probably probably be best for us to stay as far away from them as possible.</p>
<p>My assumption was only supported by the way they looked at Fran. Their eyes were filled with contempt; it was obvious that they didn't think highly of her.</p>
<p>「So you’re saying that this Black Catkin is more important than we are?」</p>
<p>「Just to be clear, her race has nothing to do with the fact that we’re letting her inside.」</p>
<p>「She is simply one of our master’s honoured guests. By extension, insulting her is no different from insulting our master.」</p>
<p>Aurel’s two gatekeepers spoke in turn, with one supporting the argument made by the other.</p>
<p>「What are you saying!? Can't you see that she’s a Black Catkin!」</p>
<p>Man, you know, this is why I hate Blue Catkin. I couldn’t recall us ever meeting one that actually didn’t look down on Black Catkin. They all just seemed to believe that every single last member of the Black Cat Tribe was useless, and that Black Catkin only existed so they could be sold into slavery and whatnot. Moreover, none of the Blue Catkin we’d met thus far had seemed even the slightest bit opposed to the idea. It’d almost seemed like it was something that came to them naturally.</p>
<p>『Let’s just ignore them and go.』</p>
<p>（…）</p>
<p>Aw, crap.</p>
<p>It didn’t really show on her face, but Fran had her foot on the gas and was ready to slam the hell out of it. She’d probably hit the limit of her tolerance if they said another one or two things.</p>
<p>『Urushi, push Fran forwards!』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>「Mmph…」</p>
<p>I pulled Fran forwards with Telekinesis whilst Urushi pushed her from behind; the two of us worked together in order to get her to move before she lost her temper. Unfortunately, our efforts didn't really amount to much, as Fran and the Blue Catkin girl glared at each other regardless.</p>
<p>『Come on, let’s just get out of here.』</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran reluctantly agreed to move after Urushi and I made a few more desperate attempts.</p>
<p>Whew.</p>
<p>Starting a fight here and now wasn't exactly be what I’d call a good idea.</p>
<p>That, however, didn’t mean that she was going to let them off for looking down on her and her kin. She turned around right as she made her way through the gate and activated the Coercion, Intimidation, and Domination skills all at once whilst also directing at the girl and the man standing beside her a powerful wave of bloodlust.</p>
<p>「Hiii!」</p>
<p>「Kuh…」</p>
<p>The girl’s face paled as fell flat on her butt, whereas the man ended up taking a few steps backwards. All their immediately ended up springing to their feet in surprise before sending their glares in Fran’s direction. Though they tried, they were unable to hide their fear of her.</p>
<p>As mercenaries, and hence, people experienced in the art of combat, they were able to recognize Fran’s overwhelming power.</p>
<p>「W-What…」</p>
<p>Fran calmly walked through the gate as she took note of the fact that the out of breath Blue Catkin girl behind her had muttered something in a lifeless tone.</p>
<p>『Look at you, all smug and stuff…』</p>
<p>「Heheh.」</p>
<p>『That wasn't a compliment, you know?』</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>

        
    		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>175. The Ten Original Tribes<br>
</b></p>
<p>「Hey, welcome.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The maid we met the first time we visited, Shara, led us through Aurel’s mashion and towards our destination, the dining room.</p>
<p>「Sorry it had to be here of all places. I was stuck in a meeting with a bigshot all day, so I haven’t really had a chance to eat anything yet.」</p>
<p>「Don’t mind.」</p>
<p>「Care to join me? My personal chef just happened to get back from Barbra last night. I’m sure his dishes will be able to catch your interest.」</p>
<p>Why the hell not? The fact that Aurel called the chef his personal one pretty much instantly convinced me that the person in question was incredibly skilled.</p>
<p>「Please.」</p>
<p>It looked like Fran shared the same sentiment, as she immediately consented to having another meal.</p>
<p>「Shara, make sure the chef makes enough for her as well.」</p>
<p>「Yes sir.」</p>
<p>It was only then that I finally realized the implication of Aurel’s statement. He was a pretty influential figure, but he was so busy that he hadn’t a chance to eat until the afternoon had come to pass. That could only mean that the person he’d been entertaining was even more influential than he was.</p>
<p>「Weird people outside.」</p>
<p>「Some sort of mercenary band, I hear.」</p>
<p>「Famous?」</p>
<p>「Well, it’s not a group I’ve ever heard of, at least. My guess is they want to talk to me so they can boost their prestige.」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, it’s something that happens all the time. People love to make claims about how well known they are elsewhere. They’ll boast about slaying powerful demons and knowing influential nobles.」</p>
<p>Oh, I get it. So everyone new in town is just desperate to leave an impression on all of Ulmutt's more important people.</p>
<p>「Aren’t't they aware that I can tell how strong they are just by looking at them?」</p>
<p>「Blue Catkin mercs, all weaklings.」</p>
<p>「Gahahaha! That so? If so, then there’s only be two possible ways for them to truly be well known. The first would be because one of their members happens to be incredibly strong. The second would be because they were cruel.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「To be honest, I didn’t like their attitudes. Their leader had sent a representative instead of coming on his own. At first, I’d almost wondered if said leader was a noble instead. Either way, I ended up deciding to just leave them be. I was hoping they’d eventually give up and go home.」</p>
<p>Huh, so they really were just scrubs after all. I guess that makes sense given that they seemed rather weak.</p>
<p>「Aurel. This.」</p>
<p>「Hmmm… I see, I take it you’ve completed my request then?」</p>
<p>Aurel opened the pendant and confirmed that we’d delivered the letter he wrote.</p>
<p>「Want to ask about evolution.」</p>
<p>「Well, it does look like you did as you were asked and got the pendant to Rumina.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I guess that must mean I’ll have to pay my dues.」</p>
<p>「Won’t need payment if told about evolution.」</p>
<p>「I’m not capable of providing you enough knowledge to have made the request I gave you worth your time.」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>「I wouldn’t have sent you to see Rumina if I was capable of telling you what you wanted to know. I simply would have told you it myself. I myself have spent many years looking into the the Black Cat Tribe and its potential for evolution, but I’ve never been able to find satisfactory results. All I know is one has to do more than just reach a certain level.」</p>
<p>Damn… Not even Aurel’s figured anything out after spending several years researching the topic despite the fact that he’s an influential B ranked adventurer…?</p>
<p>「Then would like to ask about the Black Catkin in the past.」</p>
<p>「…Where’d you catch wind of that?」</p>
<p>「Radyer.」</p>
<p>「That loose-lipped son of a…!」</p>
<p>「Was told about incredible strength.」</p>
<p>「Yeah… She was quite the strong one…」</p>
<p>Aurel began speaking in a quieter tone as he recalled his youth. He told us about the Black Catkin he met, how she saved him, and how the two of them had hit it off.</p>
<p>「It’s already been 53 years since then.」</p>
<p>「That person. Couldn’t evolve?」</p>
<p>「She couldn’t. She, like you, had been out on a journey in search of a way to evolve. She’d even visited Rumina fairly frequently in hopes of finding a clue.」</p>
<p>「But still failed?」</p>
<p>「I presume so.」</p>
<p>Wait, he presumed so? Did that mean he wasn't certain?</p>
<p>Fran had also caught onto his lack of confidence, and tilted her head in response.</p>
<p>「A few things happened, and she ended up leaving town. We haven’t been in touch since then.」</p>
<p>「Few things?」</p>
<p>「A few things indeed. Anyways, that’s enough of that. There’s no point talking about someone that’s been long gone. You’d best try talking to Dias if you’d like to know more about her. The two of them got along quite well. Anyway, why don’t we get back on track?」</p>
<p>I didn’t even need to activate the Principle of Falsehood in order to know that he was still hiding something, but I figure out exactly what that thing happened to be.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, I’d probably assume it was because she’d died off in a dungeon somewhere. If that were the case, then Aurel would probably find it rather difficult to talk about her. He also probably thought that Fran would end up mourning her predecessor’s death as well. I figured that there was no point putting a damper on Aurel’s mood, and that we could probably get Dias to tell us everything we wanted to know, so we just went with the flow and allowed him to change the topic.</p>
<p>「I’m sure you already know this seeing as how you’ve spoken to Rumina, but it used to be much less difficult for Black Catkin to attain evolution.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「That, however, has changed. It is exactly that change that leads us to our next question: why? Why did the circumstances change? I personally believe that the answer is that the change is most likely a result of divine retribution.」</p>
<p>「Divine retribution? Punished by Gods?」</p>
<p>「It’s something often applied to those that have committed grave sins or opposed the Gods. The most famous example would be what occured on the continent of Goldishia.」</p>
<p>Oh right. I remember hearing about that. Trismegistus, Lord of the Dragonmen, made use of the Evil God’s power in order to create a magic beast. Said magic beast went berserk and basically fucked the whole continent. Trismegistus was punished by being forced to fight his creation for the all of eternity.</p>

<p>「I know that it’s something that happened far in the past, but I still find it strange that there’s so little information that links evolution to the Black Cat Tribe. It almost seems to be exactly like the method in which one manufactures magic beasts in the sense that all pertinent information is simply gone. It’s like the Gods have simply erased all records of it. I dare say that they have even gone as far as to fiddle with people’s memories.」</p>
<p>Well I mean, that does sound like something a God would be capable of.</p>
<p>「Some beastkin tribes practice the art of keeping their evolutionary methods a secret, but it’s relatively easy for one to discover the methodologies so long as they refer to books or other works of literature. It’s not like that with the Black Cat Tribe’s evolutionary methods. Only a few works remain at best. I’ve also tried asking the Elves, but none of them seem to remember it at all. In fact, they seem to have completely forgotten the fact that the Black Cat Tribe was even capable of evolution to begin with.」</p>
<p>Okay yeah, that does sound pretty damn unnatural. I wouldn’t really be surprised if the Gods had just tinkered with people’s heads and forced them to forget stuff. Again, that sounds like something they’d be capable of.</p>
<p>I ruminated on it for a bit, but none of that God stuff actually served for anything more than an afterthought. I was much more focused on one of the other things that Aurel had said, as it simply couldn’t be ignored.</p>
<p>「Still some remaining literature?」</p>
<p>Fran had addressed the exact same point I’d caught onto. Aurel hadn’t stated that there were no longer any works of literature containing details regarding the Black Cat Tribe’s evolutions. He’d only said that <i>most</i> were no longer present.</p>
<p>「Truth be told, I did happen to find a single work that contained a few pertinent details.」</p>
<p>「What kind?」</p>
<p>「Calm down. What I found was not something that addressed the matter directly.」</p>
<p>Aurel smiled bitterly at the fact that Fran had gotten so excited that she ended up slamming the table while rising to her feet. Apparently the book he found wasn’t one that’d addressed the topic directly, but only mentioned it in passing.</p>
<p>「Have you ever heard of The Ten Original Tribes?」</p>
<p>「Ten original tribes? No.」</p>
<p>「The Ten Original Tribes refer to the first ten groups of beastkin that the God of Beasts and Insects had birthed into the world. Each is said to possess the power of a Divine Beast laying dormant within.」</p>
<p>「Divine Beast? Cool sounding.」</p>
<p>「Nine of the Ten Original Tribes have been known since ancient times: The Golden Flame Lionkin, The White Snow Wolfkin, The Purple Wind Elephantkin, The Orange Iron Foxkin, The Red Earth Horsekin, The Green Water Turtlekin, The Blue Life Snakekin, and The Cherry Blossom Cowkin. The tenth was, for some odd reason, unknown. For many years, its identity was thought of as one of the Beastkin’s greatest mysteries…」</p>
<p>「Last is Black Catkin?」</p>
<p>「Possibly, yes. The work I happened to procure stated that the last tribe was the Black Heavenly Tigerkin, and it just so happens to be that Rumina is of the Black Tigerkin race.」</p>
<p>「Black Heavenly Tigerkin same as Black Tigerkin? Then, Aurel, White Wolfkin same as White Snow Wolfkin?」</p>
<p>「Not exactly. We, the White Dog Tribe’s members, are capable of evolving into White Snow Wolfkin as opposed to White Wolfkin if we happen to fulfill a certain set of conditions. I myself was only capable of becoming a White Wolfkin.」</p>
<p>According to Aurel, his species, the White Dogkin, descended from a line of White Snow Wolfkin. Hence, its members were also capable of becoming a White Snow Wolfkin so long as they were qualified to do so.</p>
<p>Through extrapolation, one could then assume that it was possible for Black Catkin to either evolve into Black Heavenly Tigerkin if they too met a certain set of conditions. Else, they do as Rumina did and simply evolve into Black Tigerkin instead.</p>
<p>As a tribe that descended from one of the ten, White Dogkin were and are to this day respected by their beastkin peers.</p>
<p>「And that is why I believe it to be odd for the beastkin to have simply forgotten about the Black Cat Tribe, which has likely also descended from one of The Original Ten Tribes.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Many tribes have performed investigations in order to determine which of the tribes was supposed to be the last of the ten, many of which ended in an assertion of the superiority of one’s own lineage. Naturally, most of these assertions were false. Had he not known of Rumina, Aurel would have disregarded the work that made mention of the Black Heavenly Tigerkin as one of these false claims. But he didn’t. His knowledge of her made it so he simply couldn’t. Instead, he’d been convinced that the work he came across spoke merely of the truth.</p>
<p>But that, again, begged a question. Why exactly had that one work been left behind if all the rest had been purged?</p>
<p>「And that is all I have come to know.」</p>
<p>Aurel’s face twisted in what could only be expressed as deep rooted frustration. He’d evidently thought at length about the topic, quite possibly because of the Black Catkin girl he’d known in the past.</p>
<p>「However, I do still have one thing to say. Divine retribution comes not without salvation. Even Trismegistus may one day be released from his curse if he simply defeats the magic beast he spawned. By that logic, the Black Cat Tribe must also be capable of the same. There must be a way for you and your kin to release yourselves from the fetters that bind you.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「But again, that is the extent of my knowledge. I’m sorry I wasn’t able to be of much use.」</p>
<p>「Not useless. Helped lots. Thank you.」</p>
<p>「You really think so?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「That’s quite comforting to hear.」</p>
<p>Fran’s words caused Aurel’s expression to blossom into a heartfelt smile.</p>

		<p><b>176. Having Curry in Ulmutt</b></p>
<p>Shara, the maid, brought Fran and Aurel their meals shortly after they finished discussing evolution. She was accompanied by a pudgy man, who I presumed to be the chef Aurel had mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>「I’m sorry about having kept you waiting.」</p>
<p>「No worries, Asuto. The dish you’ve prepared has quite the delicious smell to it.」</p>
<p>「It’s one I learned of during my time in Barbra.」</p>
<p>Asuto, the chef, lifted the pot’s lid and started to stir its insides with a ladle.</p>
<p>「Oh? I’m looking forward to giving it a try.」</p>
<p>「Don’t expect too much. I’m still in the process of tuning the recipe.」</p>
<p>「And you’re still serving it in spite of that?」</p>
<p>「I’m serving it to you because I know you’ve a very sharp sense of taste. I’d love for you to help me figure out what the dish is lacking. The version I tasted in Barbra was much more complete, and also the most delicious thing I’ve ever tasted in my life.」</p>
<p>「Well, now I’m really looking forward to trying the dish.」</p>
<p>「This prototype is already quite delicious in and of itself, but it seems to be missing something, so I’d really appreciate your opinion on it.」</p>
<p>「Hah hah hah. I’ll give you as many opinions as you’d like so long as it means I get to enjoy delicious food.」</p>
<p>「I was also wondering whether or not it’d be best for me to make several of my regular dishes for the guest. Should I?」</p>
<p>「Well? What do you say?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Don’t need.」</p>
<p>「Then please do give me your opinions on the dish as well.」</p>
<p>「Leave to me.」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi simply couldn’t stand for missing out on a free meal, so he made sure to make his presence known.</p>
<p>Oh God damn it Urushi, stop drooling! We might have to pay for it if you mess it up!</p>
<p>「Some for Urushi too.」</p>
<p>「The taste might be a bit too strong for a dog.」</p>
<p>「Not problem. Urushi, Magic Beast.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Oh, he’s your familiar? He seemed so friendly that I didn’t even realize. Alright then, I’ll get some ready for him too.」</p>
<p>Asuto scooped the pot’s contents, a thick, syrupy, brown liquid composed of potatoes and other vegetables, onto a plate of rice.</p>
<p>The dish the chef had created was one I’d seen before. Rather, it was one I had a vast amount of tucked away inside my dimensional storage. Hell, there was no way I wouldn't recognize it. It was the dish I’d popularized back when we visited Barbra.</p>
<p>「Curry?」</p>
<p>「Wow, I’m surprised you knew. You hit the hammer right on the head, it’s the dish that took this year’s cooking contest by storm, curry.」</p>
<p>「Oh, right, you did say you were just in Barbra, right Fran?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Then I take it you’ve had it before?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Great! That’s just perfect.」</p>
<p>Yeah uh, it was more like she ate the stuff every single day, but apparently that didn’t matter, seeing as both she and Urushi were looking at it with their eyes sparkling regardless.</p>
<p>「Enjoy.」</p>
<p>「It looks a bit odd, but smells delicious.」</p>
<p>「Nom nom.」</p>
<p>「Worf worf. Bork bork.」</p>
<p>「That’s a good appetite the two of you have there.」</p>
<p>The chef complimented Fran and Urushi with a smile.</p>
<p>「Hmmm… The taste is… unusual, but really fuels the appetite!」</p>
<p>Curry seemed to suit Aurel’s palate. He’d initially started off eating at a rather slow pace, but soon began shoveling it into his mouth as quickly as he could.</p>
<p>「Seconds.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi finished three plates each by the time Aurel finished his meal.</p>
<p>『Is it good?』</p>
<p>（Mediocre?）</p>
<p>She ended up eating five dishes despite not really being satisfied with the taste.</p>
<p>（Nn. Still tasty, but bad compared to Master’s curry.）</p>
<p>「This is pretty good. What did you say it was called again?」</p>
<p>「It’s called curry. Barbra’s actually currently in the midst of a curry boom. Everyone’s developing recipes for curry bread, curry pasta, and other things that make use of it. Dozens upon dozens of stores have also started putting it on their menus.」</p>
<p>「Given its taste, I’m not surprised. You said this recipe still needed some work?」</p>
<p>「It does. It can’t hold a candle to the original I had in Barbra.」</p>
<p>「The original’s that good?」</p>
<p>「Everyone there has been saying that it would’ve won had the cooking contest not been cancelled due to the incident.」</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Nn! Guaranteed victory.」</p>
<p>Fran nodded happily in order to assent to Asuto’s statement.</p>
<p>We hadn’t managed to win, but we’d still at least managed to get that one dude to acknowledge the dish, which in and of itself made me quite happy. Likewise, the fact that the recipe had started becoming more and more widespread did the same. It looked people were already starting to come up with decently interesting spin offs too, like curry pasta, for example.</p>
<p>「Well, you sure seemed to suddenly get all giddy. Why the change?」</p>
<p>「Master won.」</p>
<p>「Master? Master who?」</p>
<p>「Oh, are you talking about the Master that everyone’s been talking about? The Curry Master?」</p>
<p>Wait. Wait what? Did he just say what I thought he did? He was referring to me, right?</p>
<p>「Was your cooking Master the person that introduced curry to Barbra?」</p>
<p>「Not just cooking. Master for everything.」</p>
<p>「Magic and swordsmanship included?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Master capable of anything.」</p>
<p>「That’s one impressive Master you’ve got right there. Wait, didn’t you enter the city all on your own?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Master elusive like phantom.」</p>
<p>「Well, your just as skilled as any full fledged adventurer, so I can’t say I’d be surprised if you were going around without any supervision.」</p>
<p>「Huh? So you really are the Curry Master’s disciple?」</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, apparently I actually heard him right. God dammit! Why did I end up with such a stupid sounding nickname!?</p>
<p>『Hey Fran, you mind double checking that by the Curry Master, he means me?』</p>
<p>「Asuto. Curry Master, who?」</p>
<p>「Wasn’t he your Master?」</p>
<p>Aurel raised his brow; he was a bit confused.</p>
<p>「Oh, that may be because he doesn't actually refer to himself as such. The person responsible for inventing curry remained anonymous, and otherwise went only by Master. That’s why people started calling him the Curry Master to begin with. I myself chose to follow the trend because a group of adventurers I am acquainted with calls him that, and because I only managed to get my hands on a recipe through my connections with said group.」</p>
<p>「Adventurers?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. They’re a party by the name of the Scarlet Maidens. Do you acquainted with them?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Acquaintances.」</p>
<p>Oh god damn it! It was them? Zzz… My bet’s on this all being Lydia’s fault.</p>
<p>「So, what did you think of the curry I made?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Okay.」</p>
<p>「I see…」</p>
<p>Asuto’s face clouded over; he immediately caught onto the fact that Fran hadn’t been complimenting him.</p>
<p>『Why don’t we give him a copy of the recipe?』</p>
<p>We owed Aurel, and we were probably going to be relying on him much more going forwards as well, so I figured we might as well do him a favour.</p>
<p>Fran told Asuto our curry rice recipe in exchange for his own. It turned out that some spices were rather hard to get in Ulmutt, so he’d been using different ones to fill in for the missing flavour.</p>
<p>I wasn’t able to actually try what he’d made, but I was at least able to imagine it to some extent by making use of the Cooking skill. That, in turn, made it possible for me to give him a bit of advice.</p>
<p>As a result, we were able to create a type of curry that varied greatly from the one we made in Barbra, an Ulmuttian original.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but look forward to the possibility of curry spreading through Ulmutt as it had Barbra.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>And so, an hour passed.</p>
<p>During said hour, Fran had asked Aurel about a few more things, most of which were with regards to the Beast Lord that Dias had told us about earlier in the day.</p>
<p>「And here’s what I owe you for finishing the request I gave you, as well as a bit of an added bonus as thanks for the recipe.」</p>
<p>「Don’t really need.」</p>
<p>「Please just accept it. You’d leave me feeling awkward if you didn’t.」</p>
<p>Aurel handed us a leather bag containing 300k Golde.</p>
<p>I didn’t really think we deserved it. He’d only given us the request so he could acquaint us with Rumina. Likewise, us giving him the recipe was just more or less our way of thanking him for what he’d told us, so I felt like we were still in his debt. That said, cash was cash, and he was kinda just giving it to us, so we decided to just accept it anyways.</p>
<p>「Thanks.」</p>
<p>「No problem. Do stop by again.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>

        
    		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>177. The Menace Known as the Beast Lord.</b></p>
<p>Fran left Aurel’s manor after receiving her award. The blue catkin that’d been gathered outside earlier were already nowhere to be seen. They’d likely already given up and gone home.</p>
<p>『Alright, what now?』</p>
<p>「Will talk to Dias.」</p>
<p>『Good point. Let’s go ask him about the Black Catkin he knew 53 years back, and get all our questions answered right away.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>And so, we went to the Adventurer’s Guild. The act of visiting it, however, in no way guaranteed our ability to actually meet with Dias. He was known for going in and out of the building, so our only choice was to just check if and hope that he was present.</p>
<p>But we couldn’t.</p>
<p>We were instead ended up immediately taking a stance the moment we tried to enter the guild. More accurately, we became unable to resist the urge to ready ourselves for combat.</p>
<p>『Woah!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Growl!」</p>
<p>The reason for which was the sheer extent of the pressure that'd suddenly assaulted us. Said pressure didn’t contain any bloodlust or even the slightest hint of aggression, but, we felt overwhelmed and intimidated regardless. That was just how strong its source happened to be. We were the only people around, and hence, the only people on guard, but I was sure that any other adventurer would’ve reacted in the same manner.</p>
<p>I surveyed my surroundings, only to find what could only be described as a strange looking door. It was in the middle of the road and didn’t have anything to support it. It was just there. I immediately interpreted it as something along the lines of a Dokodemo Door. a portal that could lead basically anywhere. Though, it was a bit different from the standard variant, seeing as how its appearance was that of a pair of super fancy double doors. The pressure’s source was evidently whatever lay waiting for us on the door’s other side.</p>
<p>I almost seemed to have jinxed it, as the door slowly began to open the moment I had that exact thought. In said moment, I managed to catch a quick glimpse of the furniture that lay beyond.</p>
<p>Okay, welp. I guess that must mean it really is a Dokodemo Door, huh?</p>
<p>「Right this way, Lord Rig.」</p>
<p>「Sure.」</p>
<p>A figure emerged from the door’s other side. The man’s frame was so massive that it put even Erza’s to shame. He stood at almost two meters tall, and had pretty much built purely of muscle. The way his shimmering, yellow-gold hair was arranged to look like a lion’s mane really seemed to match with the way his movements almost seemed to resemble those of a felines'.</p>
<p>I instantly appraised the man the moment I saw him.</p>

<p>Ohhhhhhhhhhh shiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeetttttt! The fuck is with his stats!? The hell!? Why does he have over 1k strength!? Holy shit, dude makes Amanda and Dias look like fucking kittens.</p>
<p>He also had a tonne of skills we hadn’t seen before, alongside an extra skill and several unique and innate skills.</p>
<p>All those, however, were basically completely overshadowed by the two titles he held: Beast Lord and S Ranked Adventurer. Wait, wait, did that mean that he was <i>the</i> Beast Lord? The one paying Ulmutt a courtesy visit? He isn’t just some really strong adventurer crowned the Lord of the Beasts, right? I mean, he is an S ranked adventurer, so that is at least a possibility of some sort, right…?</p>
<p>I wanted to examine his skills in more detail, but stopped myself as I noticed someone follow him out the door.</p>
<p>「What’s wrong, girl?」</p>
<p>We looked up to see yet another man with a massive frame. His muscles were massive; they bulged to such an extent that I almost wanted to say he’d be able to beat a stone golem in a punch out. Unlike the Beast Lord, he was a man I at least knew of, one of the Beast Lord’s two guards. I recalled him being named something along the lines of Goldalfa.</p>
<p>Apparently he thought Fran had seemed rather suspicious, given how she was staring at the pair in silence.</p>
<p>Crap. The Beast Lord’ll probably end up making note of us at this rate.</p>
<p>『Hey Fran, let’s get the hell out of here while we still have the chance.』</p>
<p>（…）</p>
<p>I figured that we’d best get out of here, so I tried calling out to Fran, but she didn’t respond.</p>
<p>『Fran? Hey Fran, you alright?』</p>
<p>（…）</p>
<p>She instead continued to just stand there with a pale look on her face.</p>
<p>（Too strong… Can’t win…）</p>
<p>Fran had always been able to keep her cool, even in front of beastkin that’d evolved, like Aurel or Rumina. Sure, she respected them, but she was capable of handling herself. But now, she was completely frozen over in fear.</p>
<p>Though, I guess it was kind of fair. The Beast Lord was a Golden Flame Lion, a member of the original ten tribes Aurel had just told us about. We’d imagined the tribes’ members to be strong, but never could we have even fathomed for them to be <i>this</i> strong. He was already intimidating enough as he usually was. I could totally seeing him instantly killing any weaker foes just by throwing his bloodlust at them.</p>

</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>Beastkin seemed more or less capable of intuiting how strong other beastkin were, so I didn’t really think it’d be weird for someone like Fran to get like this in front of one as strong as the Beast Lord.</p>
<p>「Huh? Oh, hey, you girl. Aren’t you a Black Catkin?」</p>
<p>Shit. The Beast Lord actually noticed us. Worse, he was looking at Fran as if he was trying to evaluate her.</p>
<p>「It’s pretty rare to see a Black Catkin adventurer.」</p>
<p>「Especially one with a decent amount of skill.」</p>
<p>Goldalfa added to his lord’s comment with a compliment.</p>
<p>「She doesn’t look skilled to me.」</p>
<p>「That is just because your standards are far too high, Lord Rig.」</p>
<p>「That so? Oh well, I can’t say I’m not curious, so I guess I’ll bite and show her a bit of <i>affection</i>.」</p>
<p>Tsk. Fran had caught his eye, and not in a good way.</p>
<p>The manner in which he looked at her was akin to that of a lion that’d found itself some prey; his gaze was full of fighting spirit.</p>
<p>Fran, on the other hand, was still completely frozen. The fact that she was in the beast lord’s presence had already caused her to completely break down.</p>
<p>（No… Will be killed…）</p>
<p>（Whimper…）</p>
<p>Urushi was the same, despite the fact that he was still hidden away in the shadows.</p>
<p>I considered teleporting us out, but realized that it was possible that running away like that would just bring us even more trouble further down the road. In other words, warping was nothing but a last resort. Neither option was really much better than the other, so I decided to just prioritize Fran’s will and go with what she wanted.</p>
<p>Or at least that’s what I would have done had I needed to.</p>
<p>「I am sorry Lord Rig, but I do not think you have the time for it.」</p>
<p>「Ugh, come on, Royce.」</p>
<p>A third person emerged from the door and called out to the Beast Lord. He too was someone I remembered, the carriage’s second guard.</p>
<p>The door almost seemed to melt away the moment he touched it. It was probably something he’d created with one of his abilities to begin with.</p>
<p>「We’re already late for the meeting we scheduled with the Guildmaster. We really need to hurry it up.」</p>
<p>「Mannnn, I guess it can’t be helped. Be grateful, girl. It looks like you’ll get to keep your life, for now at least.」</p>
<p>「Lord Rig, the line you just said made you appear like a gangster.」</p>
<p>Goldalfa offered Rigdis some advice on his lack of etiquette, but was immediately shot down.</p>
<p>「There ain’t much of a difference between a noble society and a mafia anyways.」</p>
<p>「I would very much beg to differ.」</p>
<p>Again, Goldalfa offered a correct, and again, his opinion was ignored.</p>
<p>「Yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up already. Let’s just hurry the hell up and get a move on.」</p>
<p>Whew. Thankfully, it looked like Rigids ended up losing his interest in Fran, as he ended up going further into the guild whilst speaking with his bodyguards.</p>
<p>Fran collapsed onto her hands and knees the moment he vanished from her line of sight.</p>
<p>She was gasping desperately for air with all four of her limbs on the ground and sweat profusely dripping from her body, a miserable state.</p>
<p>『Hey, you still doing okay?』</p>
<p>「Nn…」</p>
<p>Yeah no. There was no way she was, but she nodded in a show of assent regardless. Well, at least she’d finally regained the ability to respond to me.</p>
<p>『Let’s just get out of here, go back to the inn, and get ourselves rested up. We can head back into the dungeon first thing tomorrow morning and put off talking to Dias till some time later, alright?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>I teleported us near the inn after helping Fran up with telekinesis. I knew it was flashy, and that people might see us, but I figured it would be best for us to have her get some rest right away, teleporting was still less conspicuous than having her walk through town in her current state.</p>
<p>『Can you still walk?』</p>
<p>「Still fine…」</p>
<p>She only barely managed to drag her feet along as she walked. She was clearly even more drained than she would be after a fierce battle.</p>
<p>『Man, the Beast Lord sure did live up to his name. Dude was a total monster. Let’s try making sure we’re C rankers by the next time we run into him.』</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>[1] Seems as good a time as any for me to explain the difference between the two types of Qigong. In Japan, Qigong is described as “Hard” and “Soft,” which I translated as “Combat” and “Inner” respectively. Combat Qigong is effectively the same thing as martial arts. You use it to punch people. Inner Qigong is what relates to the healing other people with your qi (ki) stuff and whatnot. Note that these are derived from Chinese meanings, and, funnily enough differ greatly from their roots due to some sort of ancient localization error. China doesn’t actually have the “hard qigong” or “soft qigong” terms. They do have the hard/soft strength concept, but it’s applied quite differently. The hard concept is when one strengthens one’s own body. The soft concept is when one makes one’s own body more flexible. Both can be applied in a combat sense; the first is related to brute force or head on strikes, whereas the second is more closely related to receiving another individual’s blow and returning with a counter, preferably one that uses the attacker’s strength against them. Do keep in mind that Qi (Ki) is still related to the concept of healing, and good fighters are commonly also people with great control over their ki, and therefore capable of healing others. It’s quite difficult to explain this in detail without like 5k words, so I’ll just leave it at this for now.</p>
<p>[2] One piece reference. I was going to localize it the same way they localized it in one piece, but the I found out that the lazy fucks didn’t… which I guess makes sense because they have to worry about lip sync, but still. Gdi, I wanted to slack off and not think.</p>
<p>[3] This is higher tier than “Divine” because Japan says so. I was thinking of not literally translating it and instead going with "Transcendent," but I ultimately ended up just saying fuck it. I remember someone warning me about this, but I didn't want to think of something to replace "Divine X Arts" at the time. I still don't. Now, if the series was finished and I already knew all the tiers, then I'd actually bother, but it's too much of a pain when the author can still introduce higher tier shit going forward.</p>

		<p><b>178. Royce<br>
</b><br>
We were currently back at the inn; 30 minutes had passed since we met the Beast Lord.</p>
<p>『Want to just call it a day?』</p>
<p>「Still okay.」</p>
<p>Fran, whose face finally had its colour restored to normal, shook her head. It seemed she’d fully recovered after staying away from the Beast Lord for long enough.</p>
<p>『You sure? Don’t force yourself, alright?』</p>
<p>「Nn. Will go take bath.」</p>
<p>Fran liked baths, so having one for a change of pace sounded like a pretty good idea.</p>
<p>It would take her at least half hour to return. Normally, I would use the time she spent in the bath to practice using my skills, but today was going to be different. I happened to have a certain something else in mind.</p>
<p>『Hey Urushi, let’s go appraise the Beast Lord and his companions.』</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>『Let’s go hang around the guild, appraise them the moment they leave it, and then run the hell away.』</p>
<p>「Ruff…」</p>
<p>『Don’t sweat it, it’s not like we’re going to go pick a fight or anything.』</p>
<p>「Whimper…」</p>
<p>Urushi was scared of the Beast Lord, and therefore not exactly willing, but I insisted anyways because I wanted to know more about his abilities, especially seeing as it was possible for us to encounter a worst case scenario in which we ended up antagonizing them.</p>
<p>We needed to know if they had any skills that’d aid them in a pursuit. It’d be difficult to escape them if they did, but fairly easy otherwise. The former of these two possibilities implied that there was a chance we’d have to devise ourselves a few schemes ahead of time. There was also the fact that examining their skills in more detail would allow us to learn about what we might end up having in the future.</p>
<p>Things were looking pretty good so far. Goldalfa and the Beast Lord were both the more combat oriented types. Neither really had too many skills that’d help them in a chase or search. The ones they did have were rather high level, but still not enough for them to actually prevent us from escaping them. Hence, all our issues lay with the other guard and the coachman, both of which I’d missed the chance to appraise.</p>
<p>There was also always the possibility that the Beast Lord had a ninja-like covert ops division protecting him from the shadows.</p>
<p>『Don’t worry. We won’t need you to get really close to them or anything like that. In fact, it’d be better for us to stay rather far away.』</p>
<p>「…Woof.」</p>
<p>『Let’s try looking for them real quick. We’ll just totally back out if they’re not in the guild anymore, alright?』</p>
<p>「…Woof.」</p>
<p>Urushi's fear of the Beast Lord made him reluctant to go with the plan I suggested.</p>
<p>Welp, just asking him didn't work. It looked like I had to try giving him the carrot.</p>
<p>Apparently, you weren’t actually supposed to train dogs through a reward or merit based system, as it’d lead to them only doing things when also given treats. That said though, the same probably didn’t apply to Urushi. I knew that I myself wasn’t always exactly conscious of the it, but Urushi was in fact a Magic Beast, and not a dog.</p>
<p>『Well, how about this. I’ll make you some super spicy curry after we get back. It’ll be so spicy that not even Fran’ll find it too hot to eat.』</p>
<p>「Growl…!」</p>
<p>Sweet. Looks like he’s taken the bait.</p>
<p>『Alright! Let’s do this!』</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I situated myself on top of a roof that happened to have a good angle on the guild not too long after I finished negotiating with Urushi.</p>
<p>My wolf companion was hidden in a position a bit further distance away. It was safer for me to be alone. I was just a sword, so most people wouldn’t notice me so long as I made sure to use Presence Isolation. It didn’t even matter whether or not they happened to have Appraisal Detection, as they’d probably just think of me as a mysterious item that was capable of appraising things at most. Besides, it probably wouldn’t even come to that. Appraisal Detection simply told its user that they were being appraised. It wouldn’t be able to pinpoint me as the thing doing the appraising in the first place. Plus, they probably wouldn’t be able to trace me back to Fran even if they did. Who in their right mind would suspect that the sword she was carrying around was the same as the one that’d appraised them?</p>
<p>That said, one could never be too careful, so I made sure to shrink my body down as much as possible whilst also changing its shape.</p>
<p>『Hmmm, should be good.』</p>
<p>The form I took was like that of an odd looking metal ball, and hence, functioned for more than enough of a disguise.</p>
<p>The reason I had Urushi accompany me is because I needed a pair of feet to get around town. I was a sword, so I kinda couldn’t just randomly head out. I mean, I’d considered using a doppelganger, but, my doppelgangers’ skills had their levels reduced, which in turn would make me more susceptible to being discovered. I figured stealth was more important than anything else at this point in time, so I chose that over the ability to carry out the whole operation alone.</p>
<p>The Beast Lord’s presence was a fairly obvious one, especially seeing as how he wasn’t trying to hide his presence. Thanks to all that, I managed to sense him fairly easily even from outside the guild.</p>
<p>After thinking about it a bit, I realized that the Beast Lord hadn’t actually seemed all that intimidating at all when he was riding the carriage earlier in the day. The discrepancy between the two states caused me to immediately question it. Had he been trying to hide his aura back then? Or was it the opposite? Did he just recently decide to start seeming all terrifying because he had to deal with Dias or something?</p>
<p>Welp, Dias seems kinda young and all, but he is still technically an old man. Hopefully the guy doesn’t give a heart attack.</p>
<p>One of the only issues that I could really see with this whole plan of mine was the fact that I didn’t know how long the meeting was going to last. Ideally, I wanted to get back before Fran finished with her bath, so we probably only had around another 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The other thing that could totally mess up my plans was the possibility of the Beast Lord's party choosing to leave Dias’ room through the Dokodemo Door they used to port into the guild in the first place. I wouldn’t even so much as have a chance to appraise them if they didn't leave through the Guild's front door.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>Fortunately, I soon discovered that my worries were needless, as I sensed that they began moving, and more specifically, heading in the direction of the building’s entrance.</p>
<p>『Alright, I’ve only got one shot at this. I’m going to have to get the hell out of here the moment I finish appraising them.』</p>
<p>It probably wouldn’t be an issue if none of them had Appraisal Detection, but you know, just in case.</p>
<p>『There they are!』</p>
<p>The Beast Lord stood at the forefront. He was immediately followed by Goldalfa. The shorter guard we spotted earlier had taken up the rear. The coachman guy was missing, so I decided to just appraise the third guy and call it a day for now.</p>
<p>『Fuck yeah! It worked! I’m out of here!』</p>
<p>I executed the escape plan I thought up just in case they happened to have skills that would allow them to chase me down. That is, I warped over to Urushi, grabbed him, and started spamming Long Jump in the inn’s direction while also consciously hiding my presence. I figured I was probably going a bit overboard, but ended up carrying it through just in case. I chose the safest possible option because peeking at the Beast Lord’s status had caused me to feel a bit nervous.</p>
<p>It turned out the last guard was just as ridiculously strong as I’d been expecting him to be.</p>

<p>It looked like the Dokodemo Door he had came from his job in the form of an innate skill, and was actually referred to as the Dimensional Gate skill.</p>
<p>Man, that was nerve racking.</p>
<p>『We’re back~』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>It seemed I messed up and ended up eating up a bit too much time, as Fran had gotten back before us.</p>
<p>I immediately recognized the state she was in as a bit abnormal. The lights were off, and she was on top of the bed with her face in her knees and her arms around them.</p>
<p>『Hey Fran, why are the lights off?』</p>
<p>「Nn…!」</p>
<p>Fran rushed towards us the moment we called out to her. She then wrapped her arms around Urushi and buried her face in his fur.</p>
<p>『Woah. What’s up?』</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>「Master… Urushi…」</p>
<p>『What’s with you all of a sudden?』</p>
<p>「Nothing…」</p>
<p>Her words were in direct contrast to her expression. Her eyes were red, and she seemed rather uneasy. It looked as if she’d just been crying.</p>
<p>「Woof woof?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Tickles.」</p>
<p>She didn’t end up cheering up and smiling until after Urushi started to lick her.</p>
<p>That was when it finally hit me. The Beast Lord’s strength had totally broken her will, there was no way for her to have already recovered from it. She’d merely been putting up a front so she wouldn’t worry me.</p>
<p>And then there was the fact that we were just flat out gone by the time she got back. She wasn’t in exactly what I’d call mentally secure right now, so she ended up in a state of anxiety; she worried that we’d abandoned her.</p>
<p>And hence, Fran, a girl I'd always thought to have nerves of steel, had ended up crying.</p>
<p>I was assaulted by a sense of guilt. It was all my fault. I could’ve just appraised the Beast Lord’s guard whenever. There wasn’t really much of a point in going out of my way and doing it now of all times, even if I did feel a bit worried that we’d end up making enemies of them. I shouldn’t have acted on my impulses. I shouldn’t have let Fran all on her own.</p>
<p>『Sorry.』</p>
<p>「No problem. But sleep together tonight.」</p>
<p>『Huh? Wait, what? You're talking to me, right?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『But I’m a sword you know? I’m not exactly what you’d call huggable.』</p>
<p>「Don’t care.」</p>
<p>『Well, as long as you’re fine with it.』</p>
<p>「Urushi too.」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>And so, I ended up spending the night as Fran’s body pillow. I mean, I do have a sheath and all that, but I was still technically a sword, so… I didn’t exactly see how it was even the slightest bit comfortable, but whatever.</p>
<p>Fran ended up falling asleep wrapped in Urushi’s fur while also desperately clinging onto me with both arms.</p>
<p>『Welp. I got nothing to do.』</p>
<p>I wasn’t exactly able to mess around with my skills given that I didn’t want to wake Fran up. The only thing there really was for me to do was to stare at her face as she slept.</p>
<p>You know, this doesn't seem too bad of a thing to do from time to time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>

        
    		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>Rumina’s Oddity</b></p>
<p>The night passed, and with it, almost every remaining trace of Fran’s display of weakness. She still seemed a bit frailer than usual, but the look on her face demonstrated that she was back to being herself.</p>
<p>I decided not to pursue the topic any further, and instead decided to discuss the day’s plans with her over breakfast.</p>
<p>『How about diving back into the eastern dungeon and getting stuff done? You know, so we can rank up and all that.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Agreed.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Both seemed totally on board with my suggestion, possibly in part because they’d seen the extent of the Beast Lord’s strength with their very own eyes.</p>
<p>I myself felt the same way. We would probably be able to take either Goldalfa or Royce one on one and somehow manage to win so long as we used everything we had at our disposal. It’d be pretty close, but not something we wouldn’t be able to handle. The Beast Lord, on the other hand, was on a whole new level. Beating him in our current state was more or less just flat out impossible.</p>
<p>First was the fact that his stats were through the roof. He simply overwhelmed us from a numerical standpoint. We didn’t even come close to holding a candle to his might. His skills more or less gave off the same impression. That is, he had a tonne of high leveled abilities abilities we knew nothing about. He'd be able to exploit our lack of knowledge and completely obliterate us. The icing on the cake was his aura. He simply radiated an air of superiority. The way he carried and projected himself made him incredibly difficult to oppose.</p>
<p>The Beast Lord was a freak of nature, a walking natural disaster, and last but not least, an entity that could turn into to an enemy of ours at any given moment. To be honest, that very fact almost made me want to just instantly throw in the towel.</p>
<p>『Let’s just focus on finishing our quests as soon as possible instead of worrying about training and whatnot.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We decided to try finishing all the requests we had on hand by the day’s end if possible. We knew for a fact that we’d be able to finish them some time tomorrow at the latest.</p>
<p>The reason we thought such a tight schedule was even remotely possible was because we already knew where the monsters and traps spawned. Hence, we figured that it wouldn’t take long for us to reach the dungeon’s lower levels so long as we went all out.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It took us about an hour to get everything ready and arrive at the dungeon’s entrance.</p>
<p>「Hey there little missy. You’re headed back in already?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Alright. I know you’re really skilled, so I think you’ll probably be fine anyways, but I guess I’ll tell you what I’ve been telling everyone else just in case. Be careful, the dungeon’s been acting up a bit as of late.」</p>
<p>「Acting up? Something happened?」</p>
<p>「Apparently the place has started to spawn magic beasts it didn’t used to spawn in the past.」</p>
<p>The guard cum dungeon receptionist stated that Evil Beings had been spotted within the dungeon’s confines. The specific species discovered were all variants of goblins or orcs.</p>
<p>「The dungeon’s structure hasn’t seemed to have changed yet, but, there does seem to be something odd going on inside of it, so you’d best be on your guard.」</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>We entered the dungeon while heeding the guard’s advice, only to run into a goblin almost immediately after entering the dungeon.</p>
<p>The goblin left me a bit confused, as it was several times weaker than all the other stuff the dungeon typically spawned.</p>
<p>If anything, it made it seem like the dungeon had gotten much easier to handle than it’d been before, especially seeing as how its structure and trap placement had yet to change.</p>
<p>Getting on Urushi’s back and having him dash through the place made clearing the dungeon a ridiculously simple feat. It only took us about 3 hours to reach the 15th floor.</p>
<p>We spotted Evil Beings in the forms of orcs, goblins, and kobolds as we engaged in our descent. Again, I noted that all three species felt out of place, as none of them fit the dungeon’s theme or feel.</p>
<p>They didn’t really have any stealth skills, nor did they take advantage of the traps that happened to be lying around. If anything, it was the opposite. They’d end up popping and getting screwed by the traps more often than they’d actually make decent use of them.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but wonder what’d happened. I mean, the fact that Rumina had done something was a given, but the things she’d done made absolutely no sense whatsoever.</p>
<p>「Evil beings. Weak.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, but they’ve kinda made clearing through the place a lot easier than usual.』</p>
<p>An easier clear wasn’t the only benefit we derived from whatever it was Rumina was doing either. We also managed to get a tonne of creation-type skills from the monsters we encountered, something we hadn’t really had any chances to get much of up till now.</p>
<p>The High Ogres we met starting at the 12th floor were especially helpful in that regard, as some had smithing and leather crafting skills that went all the way up to level 5. Naturally, they also had pretty decent combat skills, so I was able to profit out the ass by absorbing their magic stones.</p>
<p>The smithing and leather crafting skills were the ones that leveled the most though, as both hit level 3. None of the other skills gained nearly as many levels, but we still managed to give a boost to what was almost 20 different skills for free, so I wasn’t complaining.</p>
<p>Again, I wasn’t really complaining, but I did happen to notice an issue. It felt that more and more of the magic beasts were slowly getting swapped out for Evil Beings, which in turn meant that we were going to have trouble finishing the requests we’d set out to complete, as they required us to hunt certain magic beasts in particular.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>『We should probably be a bit more careful of the traps from here on out. That said, let’s keep pushing forward.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『Urushi, you keep an eye out for enemies, alright boy?』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>The only requests we had left to complete all involved retrieving materials from magic beasts that’d been rare and difficult to come across to begin with. It getting harder for us to find them only meant that actually finishing the requests would end up being a huge pain in the ass.</p>
<p>Or at least that’s how things would’ve been had I been right.</p>
<p>『Sweet. That’s one request out of the way.』</p>
<p>There basically weren’t any Evil Beings past the 15th floor. If anything, there seemed to be more monsters than usual, so we actually managed to finish all the stuff we had to do without really eating up all that much time at all. I didn’t get why everything had ended up the way it was, but it worked for us, so again, I didn’t really mind it. That said, I figured it’d probably be a good idea for us to ask Rumina what was going on seeing as how we happened to be in the area anyways.</p>
<p>『Looks like we’re done. Should still be around evening right now.』</p>
<p>「Will go visit Rumina.」</p>
<p>『Go for it.』</p>
<p>I didn’t know whether or not Dungeon Masters actually slept, so I actually would’ve been a bit concerned about visiting her if it was any later in the day. Fortunately for us, it wasn’t.</p>
<p>We kept on guard as we entered the boss room, the room in which we defeated the Disaster Pillbug. Rumina had said that we’d be able to pass right through it, but we were a bit concerned that may no longer be the case given that there seemed to be something wrong with the dungeon.</p>
<p>But once again, my suspicions turned out to be needless. The worry we’d spent was completely wasted, as we were promptly greeted by both the teleporter that led back up to the dungeon’s entrance and the passage that led to Rumina’s quarters.</p>
<p>Naturally, Fran, Urushi and I chose to enter the latter of the two options presented, and made our way over to the room Rumina had invited us to last time.</p>
<p>She was in a bit of an unusual state; she was kind of just sitting there, completely zoned out. She didn’t actually raise her face till after Fran called out to her.</p>
<p>「Hello.」</p>
<p>「Why… Good evening, Fran…」</p>
<p>Wait, did she not actually realize that Fran’d been here? Was she maybe feeling a bit under the weather?</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell. What I could tell was that she began beaming the moment she saw Fran, but reverted to a stern looking expression shortly after.</p>
<p>「Nn. Visiting.」</p>
<p>「I see.」</p>
<p>She was acting a bit cold. Last time, she welcomed us. This time, she didn’t even do so much as even offer Fran a seat.</p>
<p>「Evil Beings appearing in dungeon.」</p>
<p>「I see.」</p>
<p>She barely responded even when Fran tried talking to her. It almost looked like she didn’t want to welcome the younger black catgirl.</p>
<p>「Um…」</p>
<p>「Fran, it would be best for you to leave.」</p>
<p>「What?」</p>
<p>「I have much to attend to, and very little time to mind you.」</p>
<p>Rumina grabbed Fran, who was staring in blank surprise, by the shoulders and started pushing her towards the exit.</p>
<p>Wait what? Why was she acting so different?</p>
<p>I figured she probably had a reason of sorts, but I couldn’t bring myself to accept her actions.</p>
<p>「Leave. You are disrupting me.」</p>
<p>「Um…」</p>
<p>「Never return to my quarters.」</p>
<p>Fran was, once again, flabbergasted. It didn’t look like she could grasp Rumina’s sudden change in attitude either.</p>
<p>I’d tried using the Principle of Falsehood real quick to double check whether or not she was just bullshitting us, but apparently she was telling the truth, Fran really was getting in her way. That, however, didn’t necessarily mean that she really wanted to treat Fran the way she was. The Principle of Falsehood wasn’t almighty. It could tell the difference between a true statement and a false one, but it wasn’t capable of figuring out the emotion that drove the statement. That was left to its user.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it’d be best for us to straight up ask her what was going on, for Fran’s sake. Leaving the dungeon here and now, and thereby not fishing out Rumina’s emotions, would lead to uncertainty. Fran would never know whether or not Rumina had really come to hate her, especially seeing as how it’d also become extremely difficult for the two to ever meet again.</p>
<p>Fran, however, would never be able to actually ask Rumina for the truth herself. She was too crestfallen, too… afraid. The fear she felt wasn’t the same type of terror she’d felt when she met the Beast Lord. It was a sentiment much more emotional in origin than the primal, instinctual rejection of death. Fran was instead afraid of losing someone she’d grown attached to. She was afraid of being disliked by one of the few people she admired.</p>
<p>Rumina was the first fellow Black Catkin Fran had met after a life of solitude, the life she’d lived after losing both her parents and being sold into slavery. Moreover, she was someone that not only earned Fran’s respect, but also treated her with affection. That was precisely why I found Fran’s confusion to be completely understandable. She was in shock. There was no way she’d be able to doubt Rumina, let alone analyze her given the circumstances.</p>
<p>And that, in turn, meant that it was up to me to ask the question. It meant that I would have to expose myself, but I honestly could care less so long as it cleared things up between the two catgirls.</p>
<p>Given that, I steeled my will and spoke.</p>
<p>『So, are you really trying to reject Fran?』</p>

		<p><b>180. Of Master And the Divine Blades<br>
</b></p>
<p>『So, are you really trying to reject Fran?』</p>
<p>「Who…exactly was that…?」</p>
<p>『Me.』</p>
<p>「A sword capable of speech…!? Are you perhaps an Intelligent Weapon?」</p>
<p>『I am.』</p>
<p>「Well… I am quite surprised to see that your race is one that truly exists.」</p>
<p>「Master. Exposed, okay?」</p>
<p>『Of course not. But it can’t be helped at this point.』</p>
<p>This was my first time intentionally exposing myself to anyone other than Fran of my own accord, and to be honest, doing it made me feel like a fool. I immediately regretted my actions because I knew they were incredibly stupid, but ultimately ended up deciding that all was fine. As of this moment, my highest priority was no longer keeping my identity a secret. Nor was it minimizing the number of eyes on us. What mattered most right now was Fran. I couldn’t let Rumina do something as detrimental to her as cutting all ties with us here and now.</p>
<p>While that was the driving force behind my decision, it wasn’t the only one that’d pushed me to expose myself. To be frank, it was in part because I felt apologetic. Fran had made sure not to tell Rumina about me. She’d gone out of her way to keep a secret from the predecessor she respected from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p>All for my sake.</p>
<p>The stress the act had caused her was only further evidenced by the light sigh she breathed as I announced my identity.</p>
<p>「I see… And that would mean that your journey was not one spent in solitude… Knowing that puts my heart at ease.」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「Mind me not. ‘Twas nothing.」</p>
<p>Nothing my ass. She too had clearly breathed a sigh of relief, one that proved she still cared for Fran. I mean, I'd clearly heard her. She’d even muttered that knowing Fran wasn’t alone had put her at ease.</p>
<p>It seemed that she really had just been putting on an act in order to keep Fran at bay.</p>
<p>「L-Let us move on and discuss matters of greater interest. Sword, are you by any chance a Godblade?」</p>
<p>Rumina brute forced her way through the conversation and blatantly changed the topic — not that I minded. We’d already gotten proof that her feelings for Fran hadn't changed. In that sense, it was safe to say that I’d accomplished my goal.</p>
<p>『Unfortunately not. I was told by a famous blacksmith that I was nothing more than a sword with a strange ability.』</p>
<p>「And what precisely might this strange ability be?」</p>
<p>Hmmm… what do? I accidentally told her a bit more than I’d been intending to. In doing so, I allowed her to catch onto something that could lead all the way down the rabbit hole, and I wasn’t really sure exactly how much it would be best for me to say.</p>
<p>『Hey Fran, what do you think? Personally, I don’t really think we need to do anything more than just make a few brief mentions.』</p>
<p>（Can't… just say everything…?）</p>
<p>Her response was exactly what I’d been expecting it to be. She didn’t want to keep any more secrets from Rumina. Besides, it seemed that the only other person the older Black Catkin was willing to meet face to face was Dias, and Dias already knew I was an Intelligent Weapon anyways, so there kinda wasn’t really that much of a point in hiding my abilities from her.</p>
<p>Besides, I wanted to abide by Fran’s will. She really seemed eager to tell Rumina, and that alone was enough to convince me to give her the green light.</p>
<p>『You know what? Just go for it.』</p>
<p>（Thanks.）</p>
<p>And so, Fran began to speak. She told Rumina everything she knew about me. She told her how I used to be human, how I had the ability to absorb skills and magic stones, and how I had somehow first came to inside the centermost part of the Maohkami Plains.</p>
<p>To be fair, Fran wasn’t the only one all gung ho about telling Rumina about me. The older Black Catkin was a Dungeon Master and one that’d lived for over 500 years at that. There was a chance she’d know a bit more than us about the circumstances surrounding my origin.</p>
<p>「Your sword can absorb skills by absorbing magic stones, you say? That is quite an interesting ability to have. C-Can it absorb any sort of skill whatsoever? Does it function with Unique Skills? What about Extra Skills?」</p>
<p>『I’ve pretty much been able to absorb any and every type of skill I’ve ever encountered so long as it comes from a magic stone.』</p>
<p>「So you truly have the ability to attain any skill you wish for…」</p>
<p>『Only if you can find a magic stone that happens to have it.』</p>
<p>「How… splendid! Hahahahahaha!」</p>
<p>「Something matter?」</p>
<p>Rumina suddenly broke out in a fit of laughter. I was a bit surprised, but could tell from the bright smile she wore on her face that she was still both lucid and sane.</p>
<p>「No, no, ’tis nothing. I simply laughed in response to what I had just come to realize.」</p>
<p>『Right, I’ve been meaning to ask you. Why exactly were you rejecting Fran just now?』</p>
<p>「I have my reasons.」</p>
<p>『And those reasons are…?』</p>
<p>「I must apologize. I cannot inform you of them. It is unfortunate, but I have no choice but to ask you to believe that my actions serve to Fran’s benefit.」</p>
<p>That, in other words, meant that whatever she’d been doing must be related in some way to Fran’s evolution. Could she maybe have been doing something that would allow for Fran to evolve?</p>
<p>『But then why were you trying to distance yourself from her?』</p>
<p>「I wished to create distance between the two of us in order to prevent myself from harming her. It seems, however, that my efforts were in vain, as I have done precisely that regardless.」<br>
Rumina’s expression wavered as she spoke.</p>
<p>「Fran…」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「I am sorry.」</p>
<p>Fran and I both stared in confusion as Rumina began bowing and apologizing immediately after she finished laughing.</p>
<p>「I have done you harm by making for myself a foolish choice. I would like to apologize to you from the bottom of my heart; I am truly sorry. My actions contained within them far too much haste.」</p>
<p>「Doesn’t matter if Rumina doesn’t hate me.」</p>
<p>「My emotions are all but given. I could not possibly bring myself to hate you, Fran.」</p>
<p>「Thank goodness.」</p>
<p>That was great and all, but her sudden change in attitude could only be described as odd. There had to be a reason for it. Looking back, I realized that Rumina stopped wanting to distance herself from Fran the moment she heard about my abilities, which in turn meant that my ability to absorb skills must be in some way related to Fran evolving. I wanted to pursue the topic further, but it didn’t seem like something she'd be able to tell us more about.</p>
<p>「Your potential is truly astounding. Are you absolutely certain that you are not a Godblade?」</p>
<p>『Apparently I don’t qualify because my stats are too low.』</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「It appears that you are misinformed. Not all Godblades have been deemed so for their offensive abilities.」</p>
<p>『Really?』</p>
<p>「Indeed. Hold for just a moment.」</p>
<p>Rumina headed deeper into her quarters, only to return a bit later on with a scroll in hand.</p>
<p>「I apologize for the delay. Behold.」</p>
<p>『What’s this supposed to be?』</p>
<p>「’Tis an incomplete list of Godblades, one I obtained long in the past.」</p>
<p>『Holy crap! You serious?』</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but feel excited as hell after finding out what we had right in front of us.</p>
<p>The Godblade of Origin Alpha Ulmer<br>
The Godblade of Insanity Berserk Dionysius<br>
×The Blade of Wisdom Cherubim Ermella<br>
The Warmount Blade Chariot Folkan<br>
The Demon Lord’s Blade Diablo Dionysius<br>
The Seeker’s Godblade Explorer Ermella<br>
×The Blade of Zealotry Fanatic Dionysius<br>
The Earth’s Edge Gaia Ulmer<br>
×The Holy Spirit Blade Holy Order Ulmer<br>
The Blade of Imprisonment Hell Folkan<br>
The Brilliant Flameblade Ingius Ulmer<br>
×The Blade of Conviction Judgement Ulmer<br>
The Emperor Serpent Blade Jormungandr Fargo<br>
The Sacred Blade of Water Crystalos Ulmer<br>
The Raging Dragonblade Lindwurm Fargo<br>
×The Nuclear Strikeblade Meltdown Ulmer<br>
The Moonbeam Blade Moonlight Kruselka<br>
The Blade of Sorcery Necronomicon Ermella<br>
The Divine Songblade Oratorio Kruselka<br>
The Blade of Hypocrisy Pacifist Dionysius<br>
The Winged Rainbow Blade Quetzal ――</p>
<p>The list contained the names of a bunch of different Godblades alongside what I assumed to be the smiths that’d crafted them. Some were marked with an x, but I couldn’t really figure out why.</p>
<p>「Do you happen to be familiar with the Extra Skill by the name of “Oracle?”」</p>
<p>「No.」</p>
<p>「It is a skill that allows one to pose questions to the Gods in exchange for a proportional amount of magical energy through the act of manifesting a God within one’s body. This list was one created through said method, as there once existed an individual that had asked the Gods for the Godblades’ locations.」</p>
<p>But wait, why would the list be incomplete then? Was it because the guy cancelled his skill so he could start writing, or what?</p>
<p>「It appeared that the individual did not have enough magical energy for the Gods to heed his request. Thus, the skill began to drain his life force instead. Still, he hungered for knowledge and continued to write to his last breath. He was a fool to the end, and failed to even record all of the blades’ names and creators.」</p>
<p>『So why do some of them have x’s beside their names?』</p>
<p>「The blades marked are blades that exist no more. I am unsure as to how they were lost, as I am doubtful as to how one would go about destroying a Godblade to begin with.」</p>
<p>So I guess that means Cherubim, Fanatic, Holy Order, Judgement, and Meltdown all got destroyed then.</p>
<p>「Alas, the list I have here is one over 500 years old. The information contained within it may no longer be accurate, as some of the list's items may have long been replaced」</p>
<p>「I see.」</p>
<p>「Now, I would like to redirect your attention to a matter I wish to discuss. Specifically, I would like to direct your attention to the blade named Explorer.」</p>
<p>「Seeker’s Godblade.」</p>
<p>「Indeed. There exists another skill possesses a skill not to different from the Oracle skill I had just informed you of. It, Named Index, has the ability to provide additional information on whatever topic one wishes, so long as they know its name. The compensation required to activate this ability is, once again, magical energy.」</p>
<p>『I’m getting a bad feeling about this.』</p>
<p>「It is as per your conjectures. There once existed a man that had tried to use the skill in order to learn more about Explorer. He too had lost his life in the process.」</p>
<p>『I knew it!』</p>
<p>「He too left behind a document as death came knocking on his door. He testified that, while Explorer was capable of granting its user high leveled search and detection based abilities, it was in fact not exceptional in terms of its other specifications. It bore only the same strength as an average Magic Sword.」</p>
<p>『You serious?』</p>
<p>「Indeed. These two pieces of knowledge lead us but to a single conclusion. Not all Godblades are named as such for the sheer destructive force they provide. Given that, I feel the temptation to classify you as a Godblade, but I cannot. For if you were truly a Godblade, you would possess a name granted by a God. Your lack of such a name can only serve to evidence that you are by no means a Godblade.」</p>
<p>You know, I actually kinda figured that after looking over the list she’d shown us. I didn’t really have the sort of fancy title you’d find attached to a Godblade. The only name I had was the one Fran gave me, and honestly, it was all I needed. At this point, being called Master made me proud. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that I wouldn’t actually be able to stand being referred to as anything else.</p>
<p>「Fret not. You may be no Godblade, but you are still an Intelligent Weapon, a sword that one could only deem as legendary.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Master amazing.」</p>
<p>I was glad she was trying to cheer me up and all, but it also kinda made me feel all embarrassed</p>
<p>.<br>
『So who do you think might’ve made me anyways?』</p>
<p>「I have not the faintest idea. I have never seen any other Intelligent Weapons before you, nor do I know much of the altar situated within the Maohkami plains. I do, however, have a piece of information that you may find useful as a clue.」</p>
<p>『Do tell.』</p>
<p>「You simply must be the work of a God tier blacksmith.」</p>
<p>『But didn’t you just say I’m not a Godblade?』</p>
<p>「God blades are not all God tier blacksmiths work to create. Their reasons are numerous. Godblades are super weapons, and only 26 are ever allowed to exist in conjunction. Further, I have heard rumours that the crafting of such a blade takes upwards of 10 entire years worth of preparation.」</p>
<p>『10 whole years? The hell do use all that time for?』</p>
<p>「That is not a question I have the answer you, as, once again, the information's source is but a mere rumour.」</p>
<p>『Right. I guess that means I’m something someone happened to make between a few Godblade projects or something?』</p>
<p>「I believe that is indeed a possibility.」</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure whether I was supposed to be proud of the fact I was made by a God tiered blacksmith, or sad about not being a Godblade. But either way, I figured it’d probably be best for us to do a bit of research on God tiered blacksmiths, as it could potentially allow me to find out a bit more about how I came to be. Our conversation with Rumina made it so we now knew what we didn't know, which, in and of itself, was a pretty decent bit of progress already.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>

        
    		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>181. The Trio's Reasons</b></p>
<p>It turned out that Rumina really hadn’t been lying about being busy. Her familiars came to consult her almost constantly, to which she would always respond by giving out a series of orders. The familiars she had out this time around seemed to be designed a bit differently from the one we saw last time we visited. They looked more like mannequins and had the ability to communicate through human speech.</p>
<p>「Do we need to summon any more go-」</p>
<p>「No, that is enough.」</p>
<p>「Understood, ma’am.」</p>
<p>「In fact, I believe it is time for us to stop summoning Evil Beings altogether.」</p>
<p>「Yes, ma’am.」</p>
<p>Given that she was still in the middle of something, we decided to ask her a few final questions before heading back on our way.</p>
<p>『Is it true that the only reason it's hard for Black Catkin to evolve is because the tribe suffered from from Divine Retribution?』</p>
<p>「Indeed. That is precisely the truth.」</p>
<p>『So what happened? Why’d they get punished in the first place?』</p>
<p>「That… I cannot say.」</p>
<p>Damn it, I figured as much. Her answer was a bit disappointing, but I was satisfied nonetheless. We weren't able to learn the juicy details we wanted to hear, but I was at least able to verify that Aurel's theory had been on the mark.</p>
<p>『So Aurel told us about that whole Ten Original Tribes thing. Was the Black Cat Tribe one of them?』</p>
<p>「I cannot say.」</p>
<p>It seemed that her saying she couldn't tell us was more or less equivalent to her affirming our statements, so I decided to continue asking her stuff to see if we could really dig at what we wanted to know. Naturally, the whole affirmative thing was just an assumption on my part, but something was better than nothing, and I was pretty confident I was right.</p>
<p>『So I remember seeing a cloak by the name of the “Black Heavenly Tiger’s Mantle.” Does it have anything to do with the Black Catkin?』</p>
<p>he item I happened to be thinking of was one of the things Salrut had been wearing. Taking the item’s name and assuming the worst possible scenario allowed me to come up with the conjecture that it was something made out of one or more evolved Black Catkin. Using a deceased beastkin as a material wasn’t something that you could call within the realm of common sense, but the fact that he was a Reidosian made it so it didn’t actually seem like too far a stretch.</p>
<p>「I believe that the most understandable reply to your inquiry would be one that comes in the form of an example. You are aware of the White Snow Wolves of the White Dog Tribe, correct? There used to exist a monster that shared the same name. It was referred to as the White Snow Wolf, and, like the Beastkin Tribe, descended from the Divine Beast. The difference between the two is that one was created through the union of a Divine Beast and a human, whereas the other was born from the union of the Divine Beast and an animal.」</p>
<p>You know, that actually doesn’t even weird me out or anything. Earth’s supposed Gods would do stuff like that too. Some went around taking different forms and having children with pretty much anything and everything.</p>
<p>「The two were once the same, but have now been separated in classification. One side is treated as would a human, while the other, as would a magic beast, a definition born from a time in which there was no choice but for them to consume one another for sustenance. But again, ’tis simply the talk of old. The magic beasts have long devolved and lost all resemblance to the Divine Beast save for their form. Moreover, the White Dog Tribe cares not whether one hunts the White Snow Wolf magic beast. This same concept also applies to all the remaining nine original tribes.」</p>
<p>I guess that made sense. It seemed to be kinda like how I wouldn’t think much of people killing monkeys. There wasn't any reason for me to accuse them for picking a fight with one of my ancestors just because they happened to murder one.</p>
<p>Welp, that was all I happened to want to know for now, so I figured it was time to go.</p>
<p>「I have heard that the Beast Lord has come to Ulmutt. Do be on your guard. Very little good is said of him.」</p>
<p>「Nn…」</p>
<p>Fran grimaced in response to Rumina mentioning the Beast Lord; she wasn’t completely over what’d happened yet.</p>
<p>『We’ve already met him.』</p>
<p>「What!? Has he done anything to you? Are you unharmed?」</p>
<p>『We’re fine, least for now. All he did was intimidate us a bit.』</p>
<p>The way I saw it, the Beast Lord hadn’t been intending on completely crushing Fran’s will. He just happened to be a bit too strong for his own good was all.</p>
<p>「Alright now.」</p>
<p>「A-Are you certain?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「S-Still, I believe it would be best for you to be on your toes. Not even I have the slightest clue as to the manner in which he will act.」</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>「The current Beast Lord is known for the act of parricide. I doubt it is even possible to be too careful when in his vicinity.」</p>
<p>Rumina made a bit of a dreadful face as she issued us a warning. She bore for the Beast Lord what appeared to be a rather deep seated sense of resentment, one that I couldn’t help but want to assume came from a personal grudge she bore for one of his ancestors.</p>
<p>The thought jogged my memory and reminded me about something we’d heard from Dias. He’d said that the Beast Lord was the first to order the Black Cat Tribe to be sold into slavery. If that were true, then Rumina herself most likely knew quite a bit more about it, not that she’d be able tell us anything either way.</p>
<p>「I would just like to say it once more to emphasize that I really do mean it. Be careful, the both of you.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, we know.』</p>
<p>「Good.」</p>
<p>Rumina nodded before continuing.</p>
<p>「Ah, right. Before you leave, I would like to ask you to complete a task. Could you relay for me a message to Dias?」</p>
<p>「Message?」</p>
<p>「I would simply like for you to ask him to come see me.」</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>「Now go. Do be careful on your way back, and look forward to what is to come.」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>『Look forward to what now?』</p>
<p>「Hahaha! That, I cannot say. What I can say, however, is that Fran was lucky to have met you, Master. And for that, I am thankful.」</p>
<p>Rumina refused to say another word, so ended up bidding her farewell without learning any additional details.</p>
<p>We hurried over to the guild the moment we left the dungeon. This time, we’d actually managed to get ahold of Dias. We weren’t unlucky enough to actually end up having a second run in with the Beast Lord.</p>
<p>「Have you already completed all your remaining requests?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Here.」</p>
<p>Fran handed the materials we’d gotten over to Dias, who immediately confirmed that there wasn’t anything wrong with any of the stuff we’d procured. He was a bit surprised at how quick we managed to get everything done, but ended up conforming he could now elavate Fran’s rank regardless.</p>
<p>Dias called over one of his subordinates and issued to him a few orders. Specifically, he told him to queue two announcements. The first was that Fran had been promoted to C rank. The second was that she’d accepted a designated request.</p>
<p>『You sure it’s okay to announce that she’s accepted a designated request?』</p>
<p>「Don’t sweat it. It’s just a little something I’m doing to keep a few certain individuals in check. I know for sure that the Beast Lord wouldn’t want to antagonize us in any which way.」</p>
<p>Well, I guess that’s fine then.</p>
<p>「Want to ask something.」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>『You remember the Black Catkin you used to talk to about 53 years ago?』</p>
<p>「I see… I guess that means Aurel let the cat out of the bag.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Oh, right, that reminds me. Did you guys happen to have some sort of run in with the Beast Lord?」</p>
<p>『How’d you know?』</p>
<p>I had Perfect Thought Isolation up and running, so there was no way for him to have read our minds.</p>
<p>「Heh. Just wanted to remind you that I am technically a professional. Did you really think I wouldn’t be able to read you just because I’m not actually reading your mind anymore? I’m not actually totally reliant on the skill, you know?」</p>
<p>『Seriously?』</p>
<p>「Seriously. It’s mostly because Fran happened to react the moment I mentioned the Beast Lord is all.」</p>
<p>Honestly, I should’ve seen this coming. Dias was not only a Guildmaster, but also someone whose skills focused around the concept of taking advantage of other people’s’ weaknesses.</p>
<p>「Met in front of guild.」</p>
<p>「I’m guessing you ran into him yesterday then?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『We happened to run into him when we tired checking in with you yesterday.』</p>
<p>「That’s unfortunate. He happens to be the type of person that considers intimidation as a method of negotiation. You know how he was pretty much full force when he came to visit? I guess it still is a passable behaviour though, since it stops people from picking fights with him…」</p>
<p>『What’s that supposed to mean?』</p>
<p>「Well, I guess I might as well tell you. Have a seat.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>Dias personally brewed us a pot of tea, sat down, and started to speak.</p>
<p>「It all happened 53 years ago. Both Aurel and I were still just D ranked newbies back then.」</p>
<p>Wait wait, wouldn’t that mean they managed to become D rankers while they were still in their teens? Honestly, that sounded pretty damned impressive if you asked me.</p>
<p>「I was really proud back then. I loved to brag about all my achievements. But one day, she showed up, and in doing so, tore my beloved pride to shreds.」</p>
<p>「Black catkin girl?」</p>
<p>「The Black Catkin girl indeed. Her name was Kiara, and back then, she’d only been a mere 15 years old. Me and Aurel, we honestly used to look down on her, but not because she was a Black Catkin. The reason we didn’t really approve of her was because she was younger than us. We didn’t really think adventuring was something a kid could pull off.」</p>
<p>I guess adventurer culture really hasn’t changed in the last 50 odd years, has it?</p>
<p>「Our negative view of her, however, was incredibly short lived. She shut us up almost immediately by putting her strength on display, as she would always beat up anyone that mocked her. I can’t deny that she had the tendency to go a bit overboard, but that only served to emphasize her ability. Though she only went solo, her dungeon raids could only be described as extremely successful. I don’t know exactly when it happened, but she ended up earning herself a nickname, we adventurers had started referring to her as “The Black Cat.” 」</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>That’s pretty damned impressive. I wonder, did she have some sort of magic item that assisted her? Or was she simply a genius of some sort?</p>
<p>「So a few things happened, and she ended up saving both Aurel and I from certain death. The three of us started partying up thereafter from time to time. Honestly, she was a lot of fun to be around. I don’t recall ever being bored in her presence.」</p>
<p>「Fell in love?」</p>
<p>「Ahahahaha! Man, you just went straight there without a moment’s hesitation. Hmmm… I’m not quite sure, to be honest. What I can say for sure though is that I used to look up to her, and that she was indeed quite the beauty.」</p>
<p>Dias’ smile was tinged with an ever so slight bit of sadness. It seemed he still missed her.</p>
<p>「Kiara… wanted to evolve. She’d already hit her maximum level, but didn’t know what to do thereafter, or at least until she met Rumina. The two talked about several different things on several different occasions. One of their conversations seemed to have ended up giving Kiara a hint as to what she needed to do, and thus, prompted her disappearance.」</p>
<p>「Seemed?」</p>
<p>「I put it that way because I don’t actually know what happened to her. She disappeared before telling me any details.」</p>
<p>『Did she disappear so she could go evolve?』</p>
<p>「I doubt it. At one point, she’d told both Aurel and I that she wanted to us to accompany her and lend her our abilities so that she could evolve.」</p>
<p>Huh, then why’d she end up leaving without saying anything to either of them then? She had to have a pretty damned good reason to just up and vanish.</p>
<p>「Aurel and I both came to the conclusion that she got involved in some sort of incident, so we tried our best to find her. In the end, all we managed to get were a few hints.」</p>
<p>「Details?」</p>
<p>「The first hint was that Rumina and Kiara seemed to have ended up arguing with each other just before it happened. Aurel happened to overhear the latter shout at the former while telling her to mind her own business, and that she was going too far.」</p>
<p>I wonder what ended up leading to that? Rumina didn’t really seem to be the type that’d try to harm a Black Catkin.</p>
<p>「Well, that part’s actually not too relevant. Kiara’s disappearance wasn’t Rumina’s fault. That much, I verified with by reading Rumina’s mind.」</p>
<p>Specifically, he’d drawn the conclusion because Rumina had ended up reacting with both surprise and sorrow when she caught wind of Kiara’s disappearance.</p>
<p>「However, it seemed that Kiara really had caught on to what Black Catkin needed to do to evolve. Hence why I thought it to be something to do with her disappearing.」</p>
<p>『Did someone end up targeting her because they found out she knew what to do in order to evolve?』</p>
<p>「That’s what I thought too. I even actually ended up identifying the person likely responsible for her disappearance..」</p>
<p>「Who?」</p>
<p>「I was convinced it was the Beast Lord that happened to be in power at the time, the current Beast Lord’s father. To be more exact, the perpetrators had been the Blue Catkin that worked under him. I don’t have any real proof, but I did manage to get myself enough evidence to at least make them out to be suspects.」</p>
<p>Dias and Aurel had heard rumours of several Blue Catkin often visiting the place she stayed at immediately following her disappearance. Thus, they investigated them.</p>
<p>They used Aurel’s influence and information network to snoop around until they came across a piece of information that stated that the the Beast Lords of old weren’t actually Golden Lionkin, but instead Black Tigerkin.</p>
<p>From that, the two came to the conclusion that the Golden Lionkin had ended up usurping the Black Tigerkin after the latter incurred the Gods’ wrath.</p>
<p>The Golden Lionkin had obtained dominion over the Beastkin. But even then, they were still afraid, terrified that the Black Tigerkin may one day reclaim what was once theirs. Hence, they eliminated any and all documents pertaining to the the past, destroyed anything that would hint at what the Black Catkin needed to do in order to evolve, and ordered the Blue Catkin to persecute them and keep them as weak as possible. And that, in turn, explained precisely why none of the other tribes give the Blue Cat Tribe flak for selling their fellow beastkin into slavery; the ruling tribe had their backs.</p>
<p>It was a deal the Blue Cat Tribe only derived benefit from. They not only rose in prestige, but also gained a significant source of income from their dealings in the slave trade. Plus, it was an opportunity for them to trample upon those that’d been thought of as superior to them, an opportunity they took with glee. Through this, one could clearly tell that the Blue Cat Tribe’s disdain for the Black Cat Tribe remained despite the fact that the Gods had erased their from their memories the other tribe’s sins.</p>
<p>「We tortured and interrogated all the Blue Catkin in town at the time, only to find that one of their higher ups, one that still resided within the Beastkin’s country, had ordered Kiara’s capture. Through that, we also learned that the Beast Lord had sent a skilled warrior that hailed from a tribe that’d served by his side for generations, and that said warrior had happened to come in contact with Kiara.」</p>
<p>In other words, the Beast Lord had either killed, kidnapped, or silenced Kiara…</p>
<p>Hearing Dias’ tale had caused Fran to become angrier than I’d ever seen her before. She trembled in rage and irradiated an air of bloodlust so powerful that I actually felt grateful we were talking to Dias in particular. Her desire to kill had swollen up to the point where it’d probably terrify just about anyone else.</p>
<p>「Truth?」</p>
<p>「Again, I can’t really say 100% for certain, as these are just my deductions, nothing more, nothing less. That said, I’m convinced that she did end up getting involved with the Beast Lord.」</p>
<p>「Ok.」</p>
<p>Fran’s expression turned dark. I felt as if she probably would’ve charged straight at the Beast Lord and challenged him had she not been aware of the extent of his strength. Having met him, she and I were now both aware just how bad an idea that was. Approaching him without a plan could only lead to death. To make matters worse, his guards were highly capable. We’d at least need Fran to evolve before even thinking of challenging him. Knowing that, Fran held herself back, but in doing so, ended up clenching her fists so hard that she started bleeding.</p>
<p>「I know you’re angry, but don’t go challenging the Beast Lord, alright?」</p>
<p>「Nn…」</p>
<p>Fran nodded despite being about as frustrated as could be. She probably would’ve immediately stormed over, beat the crap out of him, and made him divulge everything she knew if she could.</p>
<p>「Listen. Don’t throw your life away. Evolve and get stronger before even thinking of challenging him.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Dias shifted gears and began talking about his association with Rumina.</p>
<p>The two of them suffered a mental blow from Kiara’s disappearance, and thus, ended up agreeing to a pact, one in which both parties would work to support any Black Catkin that happened to follow in her footsteps, any Black Catkin that sought evolution.</p>
<p>Rumina used her abilities in order to create a second dungeon, Ulmutt’s western dungeon. She’d intentionally crafted it as a training ground for new adventurers, for Black Catkin that wished to become more powerful. The western dungeon was advertised as a second dungeon, its own independent labyrinth. But in reality, that wasn’t the case. It was merely an extension of the eastern one. There was no second Dungeon Master. The role had simply been played by Rumina all along.</p>
<p>That wasn’t all she did either. She’d also saved up as much strength as she could in order to assist any and all Black Catkin that’d reached their level caps in the process of evolution. Dias didn’t know the particulars himself. Rumina couldn’t tell him what was needed for Black Catkin to evolve. However, she was able to tell him that he was still able to be of assistance. She would need an exorbitant amount of magical energy in order to provide the assistance she wished to. It wasn’t an amount that was outside of the scope of her abilities so long as she conserved as much as she could over the course of several decades. That, however, wasn't something she could just do. There were naturally downsides to her actively conserving her magical energy. The act of it left the dungeon defenseless. She needed a method by which she could ward off powerful adventurers in the meantime.</p>
<p>And that was where Dias came in.</p>
<p>He reported to the Adventurer’s Guild and state that he’d managed to negotiate with the Dungeon Master. That, of course, wasn’t all. He also spoke to the country’s leaders and convinced them that the dungeon was valuable, both for its resources and for its ability to rear new adventurers. The scheme paid off. The Kingdom viewed his contributions as phenomenal, and hence, he was not only able to guarantee Rumina’s safety, but also become the city's Guildmaster.</p>
<p>Dias had done it.</p>
<p>He’d obtained all the power he needed in order to protect the Black Cat Tribe.</p>
<p>The elderly adventurer’s words hadn’t contained even the slightest shred of falsehood. He, Aurel and Rumina were all truly working towards the same two goals: identifying Kiara’s enemies and protecting the Black Cat Tribe as a whole. That was why all three individuals had treated Fran so favourably.</p>
<p>「We’ll announce that you’ve ranked up some time tomorrow.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>「That said, there is an official process that we need to go through. Why don’t we go ahead and get all that out of the way right here and now?」</p>

		<p><b>182. Getting One's Thoughts in Order<br>
</b><br>
We headed back to the inn after we finished going through the formal rank up procedure.</p>
<p>『Looks like we’re finally officially C rankers.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『Let’s throw a bit of a celebration. How about this, I'll let you guys can eat as much curry as you want tonight. There won't be any limit on the number of toppings you can have either.』</p>
<p>「Nn! Want curry with hamburgers, karaage, tonkatsu, egg on top. Extra large.」</p>
<p>I gave Fran exactly what she asked for. The end result turned into something that looked like it came straight out of a food challenge, but whatever. She was happy, and that was all that mattered.</p>
<p>『Try not to bloat yourself too much, alright?』</p>
<p>「No problem.」</p>
<p>『And as for you, Urushi, I've finally made that super spicy stuff I promised you yesterday.』</p>
<p>「Bark bark.」</p>
<p>The pot of curry I showed Urushi was a modified version of the spiciest curry I had sitting around in storage. I added a whole sloth of extra spice to it and caused the amount of capsaicin within to skyrocket. The liquid within had been turned crimson, and almost looked like a boiling vat of blood that’d come straight out of hell. To Urushi, however, the mixture evidently looked and smelled delicious, as he immediately began to drool the moment I procured it.</p>
<p>I honestly didn’t really get how or why he was actually looking forward to consuming the stuff. It was so spicy that it even caused Fran to reel back; she didn’t even want to try it. I felt that I probably would’ve reacted the exact same way had I still been human.</p>
<p>The pair went through their curry incredibly quickly, so I decided to serve them some desert in the form of ice cream as I began getting my thoughts in order. I decided not to think about the possibility of me having been made by a God-tier blacksmith, and only focused on concepts related to Fran and evolution.</p>
<p>The Black Cat Tribe was one of the original ten, and the tribe had originally held either the Beast Lord’s position or something similar. That, however, all changed somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 years ago.</p>
<p>We were never able to figure out exactly what the Black Cat Tribe’s sin had been, but whatever it was, it was enough to merit having the Gods deliver onto them Divine Retribution. Specifically, the Gods changed the conditions under which Black Catkin evolved; they made it much more difficult. Not a single individual had managed to fulfill the necessary requirements ever since.</p>
<p>And that was when the Red Cat Tribe’s Golden Lionkin stepped in. They toppled the powerless Black Cat Tribe’s rule, and stole for themselves the Beast Lord’s seat. They then ordered the Blue Cat Tribe’s members to persecute the Black Catkin in order to prevent them from ever regaining their former glory. It was an order the Blue Cat Tribe had likely abided by due to the fact that the Red Cat Tribe was one of the original 10, and therefore of a higher status. It was a firm measure, but it alone failed to sate the Red Cat Tribe's concerns. They still feared that the Black Cat Tribe could one day rise again to power, and thus, they destroyed any and all texts relating to the Black Cat Tribe’s evolution. It was a plan that, in their eyes, ensured that no Black Catkin would ever evolve again.</p>
<p>Their efforts paid off; the combination of the Gods manipulating everyone’s memory and the Red Cat Tribe eliminating all the relevant documentation made it so that the Black Cat Tribe’s history had almost been forgotten. The number of people possessing knowledge of their ability to evolve had been cut down to just a few handfuls at best.</p>
<p>But, 53 years ago, someone had pulled off the nigh impossible. That someone, Kiara, had started solving the mysteries that shrouded the Black Cat Tribe's past. She managed to get in touch with Rumina, and in doing so, somehow managed to find a clue that led her towards her goal, evolution. She’d asked both Dias and Aurel for their assistance in evolving, but disappeared before telling either of the two any further details.</p>
<p>All three of the people that Kiara had bonded with, Rumina, Dias, and Aurel, attempted to figure out what had happened to her. They gathered information from all over, only to ultimately arrive at the deduction that her disappearance most likely had something to do with the Beast Lord. They were fairly confident in what they’d thought up, but had no way of confirming it for certain. For that reason, all three individuals happened to regard the Beast Lord with a sense of animosity.</p>
<p>To be frank, I thought their theory seemed like it'd pretty much hit the nail on the head. The royal family being afraid Black Catkin even to this very day was honestly quite plausible.</p>
<p>Either way, Kiara’s whereabouts ended up remaining as an unknown. None of the three were really ever able to move on, and so, they ended up banding together in order to protect any that followed in their friend's footsteps.</p>
<p>Dias was unaware as to the details, and hence, unable to inform us, but we were still made to know that Rumina had been storing magical energy for decades, and that said magical energy would be used in order to aid one or more Black Catkin in their quest for evolution. Both Aurel and Dias were assigned the role of protecting her in the meantime, as saving up her magical energy was equivalent to her lowering her defenses. I’d say the two were quite persistent in their task. Dias had even gone as far as becoming the master of Ulmutt’s Adventurer’s Guild.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years to present day, and finally, enter Fran, a young Black Catkin girl out on a journey to achieve the exact thing they’d been looking to facilitate. Unaware to us, the three had played a bunch of cards under the table in order to assist us in the whole ordeal. Specifically, Aurel had arranged for us to meet Rumina while Dias had tried his best to help us rank up so he could confer upon us the guild’s protection.</p>
<p>Rumina had also started setting something up. I didn’t know exactly what that something was, but I did know that it was something that’d work to Fran’s benefit.</p>
<p>My lack of understanding was precisely what fueled me to think further on the topic. Why exactly did she start summoning Evil Beings? For what reason did she try driving Fran away? Her changing her attitude the moment she heard about my ability to absorb skills made it obvious that said ability must in some way be related to helping Fran evolve, but how? Did I need some sort of skill in particular? Was it something we could get from Evil Beings?</p>
<p>There were too many holes and missing links for me to go any further with my deductions. I couldn’t figure out anything unless I had a bit more information, and so, I decided to shelve my thoughts for the time being. The Martial Arts Tournament was coming up, we didn’t have time for me to just sit around and think myself into a ditch. What we needed to do now was to train and level our skills if possible.</p>
<p>『Oh yeah, Fran, remember how I told you to think about how you wanted me to use my Self-Evolution Points? Did you ever end up figuring out what skills you wanted to level?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>I’d originally been planning to ask her about this last night, but you know, shit happened.</p>
<p>My guess was that she probably wanted to at least put a few points in both Divine Sword Arts and Divine Sword Techniques, as they were straight forward, something she used often, and probably two of the skills that’d give us the greatest boost in strength.</p>
<p>Presence Detection was a pretty likely contender as well. It was pretty close to its maximum level, and could see some decent use in battle. Its sensing abilities aided us in reading the opponent’s next move.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>The other fairly likely contenders were Flame Magic, Lightning Magic, and Elemental Blade.</p>
<p>『So what’ve you decided on?』</p>
<p>I was fairly confident in my deductions.</p>
<p>「Blacksmithing.」</p>
<p>But I was wrong nonetheless.</p>
<p>『Wait. What? Blacksmithing!?』</p>
<p>My predictions were off by a mile. They were so far off, in fact, that I ended up shouting in surprise.</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『What? I don’t recall you ever having even the slightest interest in Blacksmithing. Shouldn’t you try investing in something that’ll help you out in battle seeing as how the tourney’s right around the corner? Why choose it all of a sudden?』</p>
<p>「Because Blacksmithing.」</p>
<p>It seemed that Fran had totally made up her mind, and that I wasn't going to be able to convince her to change it.</p>
<p>「Master’s maintenance, important.」</p>
<p>『That’s why you wanted to level up the Blacksmithing skill? I really appreciate the thought, but I don’t think you need to use points on it. Go ahead and just level up the skills you actually want.』</p>
<p>「Blacksmithing.」</p>
<p>And so, given the fact that Fran was being stubborn, I ended up maxing out the Blacksmithing skill.</p>
<p>《Blacksmithing has reached its maximum level. You have obtained the Blacksmith Magic skill. It is currently at level 1.》</p>
<p>I ended up getting the Blacksmith Magic skill as an added bonus. That was nice and all, seeing as how it became possible for me to maintain myself and whatnot, but I had a bit of a hard time accepting the fact that we ended up using my self evolution points for Blacksmithing of all things. It just felt wasteful.</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>『Wait, Fran, what’re you doing?』</p>
<p>「Maintenance.」</p>
<p>『Right now?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>I really had to admit, Lv 10 Blacksmithing really did prove quite effective. Fran was pretty much doing exactly the same thing she’d always been doing, but it ended up feeling just as good as when Zerld did it. Fran rubbing a cloth across my blade felt as good as a full body massage.</p>
<p>『Ahhhhhh, yeahhhhh, that’s the spot.』</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I ended up getting polished for a whole 30 minutes; I wasn’t really able to ask her to stop because of how good it felt.</p>
<p>Thinking about the fact that Fran planned to polish me every day put a huge grin on my face. Man, this is the life. I guess I finally understand why fathers love it so much when their daughters give them backrubs.</p>
<p>『Oh man, that was refreshing. Thanks.』</p>
<p>「Will polish more in future.」</p>
<p>『Please do.』</p>
<p>I’d been planning on using most of the rest of my remaining self-evolution points on a few specific skills, but realized that Fran hadn’t benefited at all from me maxing out Blacksmithing, so I offered to let her use all the points I had left on whatever she wanted.</p>
<p>「Already chose what wanted. Will let Master use rest.」</p>
<p>『But…』</p>
<p>「Just use.」</p>
<p>I ended up conceding to Fran and spending points on whatever I wanted. Specifically, I ended up throwing a bunch into Divine Sword Arts. It went without saying that leveling the skill worked to Fran’s benefit, but that wasn’t the only reason I pointed it.</p>
<p>The other was something that I’d ended up becoming curious about after seeing the Beast Lord’s skillset. He was a bonafide spearman. His job described him as a Spear Lord and he evidently had one equipped. However, he didn’t have access to Spear Arts or Divine Spear Arts. He instead had a skill by the name of Spear Lord Arts.</p>
<p>Spear Lord Arts was, in all likelihood, what one would obtain after completely maxing out one’s Divine Spear Arts. From that, I figured that maxing Divine Sword Arts could potentially unlock a new skill, and hence, wanted to try getting my hands on it.</p>
<p>『Alright, here we go.』</p>
<p>Maxing both Blacksmithing and Divine Sword Arts ended up eating a total of 34 points, and left me with only 20 remaining.</p>
<p>《Divine Sword Arts has reached its maximum level. You have obtained the Enhanced Sword Arts skill.》</p>
<p>Well, that wasn’t what I was expecting, but hey, that works too I guess.</p>
<p>《You have unlocked a unique skill by the name of Sword Lord Arts, as all necessary requirements have been fulfilled. All Sword Art related skills have been merged into the Sword Lord arts skill. Acquisition of the Sword Lord Arts skill has caused your wielder, Fran, to obtain the Sword Lord title.》</p>
<p>Woah, that was a lot all at once! It looked like I actually did manage to get the Sword Lord Arts skill that I’d been hoping for. The merged part confused me, so I quickly appraised myself. Every single last one of my Sword Art related skills had ended up disappearing. Naturally, I wasn’t just referring to the Divine Sword Arts skill, but also stuff like Short Sword Arts and Katana Arts.</p>
<p>For a moment, I was tempted to immediately begin screaming in frustration, but stopped almost immediately as I realized what the word “merged” meant. I decided to give the skill a quick once over just to be sure.</p>
<p>Sword Lord Arts: Allows use of all swords.</p>
<p>Oh hell yes. This means what I think it means, right?</p>
<p>『Hey Fran.』</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>『I’m going to shapeshift a bit. Do me a favour and try swinging me around when I do.』</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>The first form I took was that of a dagger, otherwise known as a short sword. Fran readily grabbed ahold of me and began swinging me around. She cycled between a series of relaxed and more intense actions so easily that one could probably mistake her as a sword dancer.</p>
<p>『Alright, how about this?』</p>
<p>The next form I took was that of a foil, a fencer’s sword. Again, Fran managed to wield me with ease. They way she moved around and used the sword’s flexibility made it seem like she’d trained with a foil for years and in doing so, completely mastered the blade’s use.</p>
<p>「Interesting to use. Boingy.」</p>
<p>『Does it feel even the slightest bit unnatural?』</p>
<p>「Nope. No issues.」</p>
<p>『Sweet.』</p>
<p>The skill did exactly what I thought it did. It basically allowed the person that had it to use any type of sword they wished. Better yet, they’d be able to use it just as well as if they had they maxed out the divine arts for whatever sword subcategory they happened to be working with. To us, that was nothing but good news, as it meant that there wouldn’t be any issues even if I was to warp myself into an actual katana and not just something that happened to resemble one.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, I decided to check Fran’s new title.</p>
<p>Sword Lord: A title granted to one that mastered the way of the sword and obtained the Sword Lord skill.</p>
<p>Effect: All stats increased by 20. Bolsters the Enhanced Sword Arts skill. Allows one to judge the quality of a sword.</p>
<p>Sword Lord looked to be even more effective a title than both Match For a Thousand and Big Game Eater despite the fact that both titles were typically only bestowed to heroes. Boosting all one’s stats by 20 provided the same amount of effective strength as four or five levels.</p>
<p>Though, thinking about it, I realized that maxing out one’s Divine Weapon Arts was actually incredibly difficult under normal circumstances. In fact, neither Amanda nor Forrund had actually managed to do so, and they were both famous A ranked adventurers.</p>
<p>It looked like maxing out Divine Sword Arts was indeed the right choice to make. I immediately considered maxing out Divine Sword Techniques to match, but I wasn’t 100% sure if that was the best idea. I had a few other skills I wanted to pump points into as well.</p>
<p>『Hey Fran, you sure you didn’t want me to point anything else in particular?』</p>
<p>「Nn… Dimensional Magic?」</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>

        
    		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>183. Dimension Gate<br>
</b><br>
Fran’s reply to my query caught me off guard. The fact that she was interested in Dimension Magic wasn’t something I’d been aware of.</p>
<p>That said, I could easily see why she felt the way she did, as I shared her interest in it.</p>
<p>『You sure you don’t want to pump a few points into Divine Sword Techniques first?』</p>
<p>「More curious about Dimension Magic.」</p>
<p>『Why’s that?』</p>
<p>「Door used by Beast Lord’s guard.」</p>
<p>『Oh nice. Looks like we’re on the same page then.』</p>
<p>Royce’s skill, Dimensional Gate, sounded like something one would probably learn if they pumped a few levels into Dimension Magic. It looked super convenient to use, and it seemed that having it could potentially make visiting Rumina a hell of a lot easier.</p>
<p>Long Jump was nice and all, but it was too limited in its use.</p>
<p>The number of things that bothered us about it numbered two, with the first being its carrying capacity and the second being its ease of use, or rather, its lack thereof. It’s carrying capacity was limited by mass, and was actually so lacking that it couldn’t even allow us to warp Urushi unless he shrank himself down. Even then, the distance that could be teleported was inversely proportional with the mass, so we weren’t really able to go all that far. The furthest we could go, even without Urushi, was like five or six floors worth of distance at best; we weren’t able to instantly warp ourselves over to Rumina’s place of residence. The ease of use part pertained to the fact the only objects that could get warped were ones the caster was in direct contact with.</p>
<p>Dimension Gate looked like the type of skill that didn’t really care about the mass of whatever it transported so long as you plopped a pair of doors down. It didn’t look like the type of skill that really had much use in battle, but, man did it make getting around a helluva lot easier. The convenience factor alone made it look like something that was honestly well worth investing in.</p>
<p>『Alright. I guess I’ll try feeding Dimension Magic a bit and seeing what happens.』</p>
<p>I only had 20 self evolution points remaining, so I decided to give the skill one level at a time.</p>
<p>「That’s level 2… Looks like I learned how to do two new things?」</p>
<p>Pointing the skill once had allowed me to obtain a skill by the name of Turn Shield. It allowed one to block long ranged attacks and disrupt enemies by twisting space itself. The amount of magical energy the skill consumed scaled with the size of the spatial distortion created. Unleashing something on a scale large enough to completely engulf my surroundings seemed like it would end up eating somewhere in the neighborhood of 2k mana. The skill seemed pretty decent, and appeared to have a whole slew of different use cases.</p>
<p>The other spell I learned was named Beacon. It allowed me to sense the areas in which and objects on which I cast it, even from a fair distance away. It was pretty convenient, but I didn’t immediately see why it was something I got from leveling up Dimension Magic of all things. I only came to realize why it was classified as it was after giving its parent skill another level.</p>
<p>Getting Dimension Magic to level 3 unlocked a skill by the name of Apport. Apport allowed me to pull anything within sight towards me. It didn’t seem all that special at first glance, but thinking about it made me to realize that moving an object towards oneself was actually a step up on moving oneself over to an object.</p>
<p>Combining it with Beacon only made it even more impressive; Apport became able grab anything I wanted so long as it happened to have a beacon placed on it ahead of time. This use case immediately caused me to realized that Beacon was capable of working with more than just Apport. It also enhanced Long Jump, and allowed me to teleport even greater distances with it. Beacon had seemed rather plain at first, but it turned out to be something hella useful.</p>
<p>Apport wasn’t all I got from level 3 Dimension Magic. I also managed to learn Over Haste, which was basically just the same thing as regular Haste, save for the fact that it had a bit of an AOE to it.</p>
<p>Only after pointing Dimension Magic all the way to level 4 did we finally get the skill we’d been gunning for.</p>
<p>『Sweet, looks like I finally learned how to use Dimension Gate.』</p>
<p>Dimension Gate’s ability was to create a pair of doors. The first would always appear at the caster’s present location. The second, on the other hand, was up to the caster’s discresion, but could only be placed in an areas that lay within the caster's memory. Anything could pass through the gate, so long as it fit, which was just perfect seeing as how the gate's size would grow based on the amount of magical energy used. I was capable of creating one big enough to fit Urushi at his largest if I didn’t mind throwing in all my mana.</p>

<p>Our skill, Dimension Gate, was actually slightly different from the Dimensional Gate skill that we’d seen on Royce. Though their names were similar, the two actually functioned completely differently, as ours basically just ripped a hole in space, whereas Royce's seemed to operate based on a different sort of mechanism altogether.</p>
<p>Dimension Gate was like every other spell derived from the Dimension Magic family; its performance could be improved upon through the use of Beacon.</p>
<p>Specifically, Dimension Gate was capable of opening doors to places I’d never been before so long as there happened to be a beacon present — we’d confirmed this functionality by casting Beacon on a random rock and having Urushi carry it off somewhere.</p>
<p>The spell seemed like it could be really handy so long as we were careful and placed a few beacons at a few critical junctions ahead of time.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, Beacons would expire after a few days. The caster could extend this preset duration by increasing the amount of mana used in the spell’s initial casting. It seemed like I’d be able to leave a beacon somewhere for about a year so long as I put every single last drop of mana I had into crafting it.</p>
<p>I figured it’d be a pretty good idea for us to just casually dump a beacon somewhere in Rumina’s living quarters in order to make it easier for us to visit her whenever. The gate’s size would decrease as distance to its target location increased, but it didn’t seem like it’d be too hard for us to somehow fit ourselves through it regardless.</p>
<p>The other spell I was granted for leveling Dimension Magic to level 4 was called Slow Mine, and more or less allowed us to deploy triggerable debuff zones. They were hard to detect, and could be placed both on the ground and in the air. Our ability to deploy multiple at once seemed pretty useful for allowing us to catch someone off guard.</p>
<p>『Looks like we managed to get the skill we wanted. Did you happen to have anything else in mind?』</p>
<p>Each level in Dimension magic ate up 3 self evolution points, so getting the skill all the way to level 4 left us with only 11 remaining.</p>
<p>I mean, we could’ve just kept pumping points into Dimension Magic regardless, but we did always have the option of just doing something else instead. It wasn’t like we were locked into it or anything.</p>
<p>「Vigour Mastery…?」</p>
<p>『Why that one in particular?』</p>
<p>「Beast Lord had. Might have connection with evolution.」</p>
<p>Looking at the Beast Lord’s stat sheet had more or less convinced us that Vigour Mastery was basically an upgraded version of Vigour Manipulation. The reason she wanted it was pretty clear as well. She wanted get all the skills the Beast Lord had that we didn’t, as it was possible that evolution was something linked to a skill.</p>
<p>『Sure. Let’s give it a shot then.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>I spent 5 points on Vigour Manipulation, which in turn unlocked Vigour Mastery as expected.</p>
<p>『So? How do you feel?』</p>
<p>「…?」</p>
<p>It turned out that Vigour Mastery didn’t have anything to do with evolution. However, it had a clear, immediate effect nonetheless. The manner in which my mana flowed through my body seemed to change. It became much smoother, and I could feel my detection-based skills growing much more sensitive as a result.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t all.</p>
<p>『I feel like my body just got easier to control.』</p>
<p>I activated Shape Shift and transformed a part of my body into a series of threads. The threads seemed quite easy to manipulate; I'd managed to use them to form a number of different geometrical patterns with ease. I then split my blade into ten smaller pieces, and moved them all around simultaneously. I was able to do what the System Announcer did to the Legendary Skeletons did back when we fought a whole bunch of them at once. That is, I was able to form each into a thin but solid thread and thrust them in different directions.</p>
<p>My blade deformed and moved exactly how I wanted it to; I became capable of manipulating it to much finer a degree, and at a much lower mana cost to boot.</p>
<p>Vigour Mastery hadn’t seemed like anything too fancy, but it turned out to be useful as hell.</p>
<p>『Want to just hold onto the last few points for now?』</p>
<p>「Nn. Sounds good.」</p>

		<p><b>184. The Dungeon’s Barrier<br>
</b><br>
We immediately headed back into the dungeon the day after we ranked up, reason being that it was critical for us to get as strong as possible as quickly as possible given that the tourney was right around the corner.</p>
<p>Both Sword Lord Arts and Dimension Magic were incredibly potent skills in and of themselves, but we wouldn’t be able to use either properly if we didn’t first accustom ourselves to them. To that end, we decided to fight while purposefully imposing upon ourselves a series of heavy restrictions.</p>
<p>Doing combat training also doubled up as grinding magic stones, as we’d be able to earn another batch of self-evolution points if we did enough of it. Training was a reliable, proven way for us to get stronger. Though it was definitely important, it didn't end up being the only thing we did. We had also visited the guild prior to heading out in order to check whether or not it’d be possible for Fran to undergo a class change and beef up her stats.</p>
<p>One would assume that obtaining the Sword Lord title would also unlock the Sword Lord class, but unfortunately, it didn’t. She did, however, unlock a whole slew of other classes, many of which centered around smithing or advanced magic. The training she’d gone through had also allowed her to unlock several stealth and scout-like classes as well, but none were to our fancy. Thus, she ended up remaining a Magic Warrior.</p>
<p>Upon entering the dungeon, we discovered that it’d turned back to normal. The Evil Beings that'd flooded it were nowhere to be seen. They’d been replaced by the magic beasts we saw on our first pass through. In other words, Rumina had reverted all the changes she'd made.</p>
<p>Knowing that, we cut our way through dungeon and slowly progressed towards its depths.</p>
<p>Fran needed to be back in town within 4 days, as that was when the tourney’s prelims were set to begin. For us, however, heading back to town was a trivial non-issue, as we’d already set up several beacons that'd facilitate the process. Specifically, we’d placed one at the inn and several others just outside the city. Thanks to that, we’d be able to keep training until the very moment we needed to show up in person.</p>
<p>That said, we did have something to do prior to actually heading back, so it wasn't like we could just spend the whole four days wandering. Specifically, Fran and I had been planning on setting up an addition beacon inside Rumina’s room, as it'd make visiting her much more convenient.</p>
<p>We’d spent some time experimenting with the Beacon spell in order to figure out its limitations. It turned out that we could only actually have 8 active beacons at any given point in time. The skill followed a first in first out methodology, as creating a 9th beacon would immediately cause the 1st we made to disappear. Moreover, its range wasn’t actually unlimited. Beacons would only remain active so long as they were within a radius of about 10 kilometers.</p>
<p>Now, one might wonder how exactly we managed to figure out that 10km was our upper limit. The answer to that question was actually a rather simple one; we had Urushi grab a rock with a beacon on it and just run off into the sunset. We made him keep going until we could no longer pick up on the beacon’s signal.</p>
<p>We also discovered that Dimension Gate’s mana consumption varied with the amount of distance between it and its target. It normally ate up about 100 mana, but could consume up to 500 if we tried to jump a whole 10 km in one go.</p>
<p>I’d originally been expecting to be able to use the spell to teleport back and forth between Barbra and Alessa, but that unfortunately that didn't actually seem all that practical. That said, it could potentially be possible if we set up a whole slew of beacons along the way and warped between them till we hit our destination. Fortunately, that issue wasn’t one we had to consider when contemplating whether or not we’d be able to tele into Rumina’s room, as we’d only need to set a single beacon for it to be in range.</p>
<p>And so, with a clearly defined goal in mind, we spent the rest of our day grinding our way down into the dungeon’s depths. It was already our third time through, and we’d already committed all the traps to memory, so it'd ended up turning quite the easy excursion.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The manner in which Rumina greeted us this time around was completely different than it’d been just yesterday. Moreover, her expression was bright, and her skin, which’d been a bit darker than usual, had reverted to its usual shade. I was glad to see that she was in good health, and that the light had returned to her eyes.</p>
<p>「Welcome. And for what purpose should I attribute your visit to on this fine day?」</p>
<p>「Wanted to ask favour.」</p>
<p>『You see…』</p>
<p>I told her about the Beacon spell we’d recently obtained, and asked if we could put one in her room in order to make it easier for us to visit.</p>
<p>「I mind it not at all. In fact, I would have very much wanted for you to place one in my place of residence.」</p>
<p>『Would have?』</p>
<p>「The answer to that question shall come to you should you make an attempt. Fret not, no harm shall come to you in the process.」</p>
<p>She seemed rather convinced that we’d fail, and implied it in her speech. However, we decided to give it a shot anyways since she affirmed it wasn’t dangerous.</p>
<p>『Beacon.』</p>
<p>I placed a beacon on the floor in one of the room’s corners and in doing so, made it so I’d be able to teleport back.</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s head back up a few floors.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We made our way back up to the dungeon’s 14th floor before attempting to activate Dimension Gate — only to have the spell totally fizz out and fail despite consuming mana.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>I could still feel the beacon we’d set, and Rumina’s room was naturally still in memory, so I didn’t really see why the skill would fail to function. We’d fulfilled all its conditions, after all.</p>
<p>I purposefully activated the skill several times, but to no avail. It was never capable of doing much besides just fizzing away.</p>
<p>「Not working?」</p>
<p>『Yeah. It looks like something’s preventing the skill from actually activating.』</p>
<p>The sensation I felt was fairly similar to the one I had when we were stuck inside Rynford’s barrier. It was like something was getting in the way and interrupting the skill before it went off. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to discern exactly what that something was, nor even really sense its identity or location despite the fact that I could feel it interfering with the casting process.</p>
<p>Going back and checking in with Rumina allowed me to verify that I’d been in the right.</p>
<p>「It appears that you were unable to break past the Goddess’ barrier.」</p>
<p>Her words made me realize that her having a barrier of some sort should’ve been something I'd taken as a given from the very start.</p>
<p>Dungeons were supposed to be extremely difficult to conquer. Even something like a D ranked dungeon could lead to a whole slew of casualties. Higher ranking adventurers were generally better at eluding death, but even they could meet their ends if they got caught off guard by traps, or ran into a magic beast that just happened to be able to take advantage of their weaknesses.</p>
<p>That, of course, naturally begged a question: what was the most risk free way for one to conquer a dungeon? I was sure that many would claim that it’d best be done by training up one’s detection based skills, joining balanced parties or bringing a tonne of potions, but none of those answers were in fact correct.</p>
<p>The simplest and safest way to conquer a dungeon was to not conquer a dungeon in what you’d call a traditional manner.</p>
<p>I could imagine a whole slew of methods that worked off that precise paradigm of thought. You could teleport into the core room, blast magic into said room from afar, or pull off many other similar tricks that’d allow you to destroy the dungeon's core without having to go through a series of challenges.</p>
<p>Though the methods I imagined had many strict requirements, they were by no means unrealistic. Teleporting directly into a dungeon’s core room sounded like something that was honestly quite easy so long as one maxed out Dimension Magic and threw in a magic item or two for a bit of extra assistance.</p>
<p>Plus, it wasn’t like you could just not take the fact that Godblades existed into account. Godblades were known for their incredible power, and frankly, they seemed like items that could defy what one viewed as common sense altogether. Meltdown no longer existed, but its title had implied that it was a nothing less than a veritable nuke, a weapon of mass destruction that was most likely capable of completely wiping a dungeon and everything around it off the map with ease.</p>
<p>I thought it seemed fairly logical for dungeons to have defensive mechanisms built in to prevent scenarios like that from happening. Dungeons more or less seemed to be equivalent to trials imposed by the Gods, so there was no way for them to not have mechanisms that would prevent you from totally cheating your way through them.</p>
<p>The barrier being something created by a God only made the fact that I couldn’t sense it all the more understandable as well.</p>
<p>「I advise you attempt placing the beacon just outside my room instead.」</p>
<p>『Iunno if that’s the best place for it. Someone might accidentally blow it up while fighting a boss or something.』</p>
<p>We couldn’t put it on any floor above the boss floor either, seeing as how people might see us using the gate and whatnot.</p>
<p>「Am I correct in assuming that it will function so long as the barrier does not prevent your spell from activating?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「In that case, I ask that you wait while I make accomodations.」</p>
<p>Rumina headed deeper inside her chambers and didn’t come out until after we’d heard the sound of something heavy scraping against something else of equal mass.</p>
<p>A brand new corridor had spawned along a nearby wall.</p>
<p>「I thank you for your patience. The room that lies beyond this corridor is outside of the core room’s territory, and thus, is treated as any other one of the dungeon’s rooms would be. It will be possible for you to teleport inside of it.」</p>
<p>Rumina had made use of her Dungeon Master abilities in order to create a brand new room.</p>
<p>Man, that’s a Dungeon Master for you. She and I think on totally different scales.</p>
<p>「Thanks.」</p>
<p>「You need not thank me. As I stated prior to your excursion, our wills had happened to align. I too wish for it to be easier for you to visit.」</p>
<p>We ran a second experiment and confirmed that Rumina had been spot on.</p>
<p>The inn we were staying at was rather close to the dungeon, so placing a beacon in Rumina’s newly created room had made it super convenient for us to go back and forth between the two locations with ease. Moreover, it was basically impossible for anyone to catch us in the act. We'd ran into a few unexpected mishaps along the way, but ultimately accomplished our goal and met every single requirement we'd set for it along the way.</p>
<p>「Please, visit as you see fit. I will welcome you at any time.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『Alright, see ya. We’ll make sure to stop by.』</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>

        
    		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>Reunion</b></p>
<p>『You ready to get going?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We had breakfast, checked to make sure all our equipment was in good form, and headed out.</p>
<p>Our destination was one of the many venues in which the tournament would be hosted. The tournament had actually started yesterday, but today was more so the one Fran had been looking forward to, as it had finally come time for her first match. According to the schedule we got from Dias, the tournament was to last for 14 days, with the first 4 dedicated to the preliminaries. The preliminaries were defined as a 2 step process, with each of the 2 taking up half the allotted time.</p>
<p>Over 1000 people had signed up for the tourney, and thus, there simply wasn’t enough to time for the preliminaries to be done in the usual 1 on 1 style. They were instead organised such that they’d allow for four people to be eliminated at once. That is, the preliminaries consisted solely of 5 person battle royales in which only only the last man standing would be allowed to progress.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the tournament’s managers knew exactly what they were doing. They understood that the only way for them to complete all 200 plus preliminary matches within the 2 day timebox was for them to have multiple matches running at once. Thus, they had set up a series of locations around town in order to facilitate the process, a feat only made capable precisely because the tournament happened to take place in Ulmutt. Ulmutt was unique in the sense that it existed for and because adventurers. Hence, its city plan included a great number of open areas that often saw use as as training or dueling grounds.</p>
<p>The second preliminary round would have far fewer participants than the first, and thus, they had it hosted within a large stadium instead of all over the place. Unlike the first, the second also allowed for spectators.</p>
<p>The main event consisted of 6 rounds, which meant a total of 64 participants. About 50 of the combatants typically came from the prelims. The rest were seeded and thereby excluded from the qualification process.</p>
<p>Interestingly, killing one’s opponent was not actually considered a crime, as you weren’t allowed to participate in the tournament unless you signed a waiver. Said waiver included included a statement about the fact that you knew you were going into something that might lead to your death. Honestly, I’m not really sure what else I should’ve expected from a world as violent as this one.</p>
<p>That said, I had to admit that it wasn’t actually as bad as it may have otherwise seemed. After all, health potions were a thing, so you probably wouldn’t die unless you were killed instantly. That said, the organisers only really supplied that kinda stuff to the main event’s participants. You could say it was rather cold hearted for them to not assist those that got eliminated early on, but I couldn’t really blame or antagonize them for it. Culling the weak was kind of what this tournament was all about in the first place. Besides, distributing potions to all thousand or so participants would probably put the organisers well in the red, so it was honestly only fair. There was also always healing magic for people that couldn't afford potions, though again, healers weren’t really something supplied to people participating in the prelims.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, healing magic was precisely what made it possible for the tourney to take over the course of such a short time period. Its effects were more or less instant, so injured participants didn’t have to wait for their injuries to heal. All they needed was for someone to say the word, and they’d be back in tip top shape.</p>
<p>『You feeling nervous at all?』</p>
<p>「Nn. Fine.」</p>
<p>Fran nodded. We’d done everything we could these past few days to get ourselves as ready as we could possibly be, and so, the look on her face almost seemed to be the splitting image of confidence.</p>
<p>『I’ll just stay on the sidelines and watch unless we run into someone really strong. Alright?』</p>
<p>「Nn. Want to know how far we can go.」</p>
<p>Fran wanted to both test her own strength and see how much stronger she was when we fought together.</p>
<p>There was still a decent bit of time before the match started, so we walked through town at a rather leisurely pace. The venue we were headed to happen to be right by the guild, so we weren’t even the slightest bit worried about getting lost.</p>
<p>I made use of our travel time by explaining to Fran the tourney’s rules.</p>
<p>Given that this was a martial arts tournament, an event that almost seemed to ooze with violence, there weren’t actually all that many restrictions. We just had to be careful not to consume any potions mid-combat, and we were pretty much good. There weren't any rules against any skills and spells, you were pretty much allowed to do whatever. The only thing one would probably want to avoid would be the Evil Arts, as using them would more likely than not cause one to get instantly mobbed by any and all nearby adventurers.</p>
<p>The only part of the rules that we really had to pay attention to was the part that detailed what you could and couldn’t do with summons. Any non-human summons were in fact allowed, but only under the condition that they weren’t summoned ahead of time. In other words, we could bring Urushi so long as we had him hide in Fran’s shadow and have not come out until she pretended to summon him. The reason that this was in fact legal, and not against the rules, was because they stated that rules regarding summons applied not just to summons, but also to anything else that happened to function in a similar manner. Specifically, the rules would apply so long as the creature you called was initially either not present or hidden from sight.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">

        </div>
        
<p>Fortunately, there weren’t any restrictions with regards to magic items, you could use whatever you wanted. It seemed that what this tournament cared about wasn’t one’s base stats, but rather how strong one was with all one’s gear and familiars factored in as well.</p>
<p>There were only two possible ways to get disqualified. The first was to leave the ring, and the second, to deliberately attack someone that’d already surrendered.</p>
<p>Fran looked at all the stalls around her as she slowly made her way forwards, but as one could expect, not even she was enough of a glutton to start chowing down the moment before she had to fight her first match.</p>
<p>『You can eat as much as you want after we’re done, so sit tight for now, alright?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>She continued glancing at the stalls in our vicinity despite voicing her agreement. It was simply something that couldn’t be helped. Stalls started appearing en masse the moment the tournament began, and their merchandise honestly looked nothing short of delicious.</p>
<p>Her staring any longer would only serve to tempt her, so I had her rush back over to the guild. I didn’t think we’d end up stopping on our way there given that she’d hit the gas, but for some odd reason, we did.</p>
<p>『Is something the matter, Fran?』</p>
<p>「That.」</p>
<p>I looked in the direction Fran’s finger was pointing, only to find a stall that almost seemed a bit familiar.</p>
<p>『Wait, isn’t that… The Dragon’s Table?』</p>
<p>The Dragon’s Table, one of the stores that’d competed against us back in Barbra, had a stall set up right by the Adventurer’s Guild. Upon closer inspection, I discovered that they seemed to be selling the Dragon Bone Soup they happened to be famous for. Standing behind the counter was a familiar face, a tall, A ranked adventurer by the name of Fermus. He was looking just as sharp as he was the last time we saw him.</p>
<p>「Oh, well if it isn’t the Black Tail’s Fran.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Long time no see.」</p>
<p>「It has been quite a while. Are you perhaps here in order to participate in the tournament?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Well, then please do try your best.」</p>
<p>Fran ended up speaking with Fermus till we had to go.</p>
<p>It turned out that he was also taking part in the tourney. But as one would expect of a former A ranked adventurer, he’d been seeded and wouldn’t be going through the prelims.</p>
<p>「I would normally opt out of participating seeing as my age is what it is, but this year happens to be be a bit special, as one of my acquaintances asked me to participate. I was unable to turn him down because I owed him a favour.」</p>
<p>He had nothing to do in the meantime, so he ended up deciding to set up shop for publicity’s sake. I had to say, Fermus seemed really into this whole merchanting thing. Dude's spirit was brimming with entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Well, that’s one more powerful foe we might end up running into. He's literally killed dragons. Like shit, no way in hell we’ll be able to beat him easily.</p>
<p>Fermus also told us a bunch about what happened to Barbra in the event’s aftermath. The former Lords, the Krystens, had effectively thrown away their fortune by using it to fund the city’s reconstruction. The guild had helped out as well, so the reconstruction was pretty much right on schedule.</p>
<p>Amanda’s support had allowed the orphanage to get back on its feet, which in turn allowed Io go all out and do cook to the best of her ability. The soup Io made was ridiculously delicious despite the fact that she used nothing but super low quality vegetables in it. I really couldn’t help but wonder just how delicious the stuff she was making now was, given that she finally had access to all the spices and condiments she could ever dream of.</p>
<p>Last but not least, he mentioned that Barbra was currently going through what could only be described as a curry boom. People were setting up curry stalls all over and naming them after our own. They’d call themselves the X Tail, or the Black Y, with X and Y being substituted out for random words. Many of these stalls would claim that they’d inherited our recipes, which I guess wasn’t entirely false seeing as how I’d handed the recipe over to the Chef’s Guild and told them to do whatever with it.</p>
<p>Fran was really engaged in the conversation, and seemed really interested in everything else Fermus had to say, but we had to go.</p>
<p>『Hey Fran, it’s time.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Time for match.」</p>
<p>「Well, I won’t keep you any longer then. Sorry for the hold up.」</p>
<p>「Not problem. Wanted to talk about Barbra.」</p>
<p>「Great. Then I’ll look forward to trading blows with you in the ring.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>「Fufu. You sure do seem eager.」</p>
<p>It seemed that Fermus’ words had flipped Fran’s switch, as the smile she flashed him was one filled with drive and battlelust.</p>
<p>Welp, here’s to hoping she doesn’t hit the people we’ll be facing in the prelims too too hard.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>

        
    		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>The First Preliminary Round</b></p>
<p>Upon arriving, we found the venue to be surprisingly quiet. Further consideration made me feel like I’d stated the obvious given that the first preliminary round wasn’t actually open to the public.</p>
<p>Men we presumed to be adventurers were entering and leaving the building, their bodies exuding auras of passion and excitement.</p>
<p>『It looks like they’re handling all the reception stuff over by the entrance.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran approached the receptionist in her usual, calm manner, with Urushi hidden in her shadow. He’d actually chosen to hide there on his own volition, as he knew he would’ve ended up having to do once we got into the waiting room anyways.</p>
<p>「I’m sorry, we aren’t allowing spectators today. The second preliminary round starts tomorrow. You’ll have to come back then.」</p>
<p>The receptionist did the usual thing and treated Fran as a non-participant despite the fact that she had me shouldered. It seemed that the receptionist had thought Fran to be an adventurer that’d just joined up or something.</p>
<p>I was a bit confused as to why the receptionist didn’t recognize Fran given the guild had announced that she’d hit C rank and all that. I only came to understand exactly why it’d happened after appraising the receptionist and finding out that he wasn’t actually associated with the guild, and was instead a civil servant working under the local ;ord.</p>
<p>「Participant.」</p>
<p>「R-Really? What’s your name?」</p>
<p>「Fran.」</p>
<p>「Let’s see… Oh, there it is. Wait, you really are participating in the tournament?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Are you sure you want to? There aren’t any healing services available for the first preliminary round, so you can get hurt really badly. It’s okay for you to back out if you want.」</p>
<p>The receptionist seemed like a pretty good guy, but he wasn’t really doing Fran any favours. That said, she wasn’t getting irritated either, seeing as how she could tell that he was only saying what he was because he was actually concerned for her safety.</p>
<p>「Not problem.」</p>
<p>「I’m serious. It really is dangerous, alright?」</p>
<p>「Thanks. Bye.」</p>
<p>「Make sure you surrender if you feel like you’re outclassed, okay!? And do it before you get hurt! It’ll be too late for you to regret your choices if you do!」</p>
<p>The receptionist wasn’t able to leave his desk, so he ended up voicing his concerns by shouting them at Fran as she headed inside.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Meeting the receptionist was pretty much the only hiccup we encountered along the way; everything that happened thereafter went rather smoothly. The person that showed us around after we got inside was an old adventurer, one skilled enough to tell that Fran was much stronger than she looked.</p>
<p>In fact, he’d even ended up looking at the other participants with a look of pity, as most seemed to be grinning at her as if she was mere prey.</p>
<p>「Heh. Looks like the last participant’s just a brat!」</p>
<p>「I guess that means this’ll effectively just be a 4 way free for all then.」</p>
<p>「You do know that this tournament isn’t some sort of game, right? I’m supposed to be winning it big and making a name for myself, not playing with some kid.」</p>
<p>The other 4 participants were already present. Half of them looked like mercenaries, and the other half like adventurers.</p>
<p>All but 1 of the participants had ended up looking down on Fran. The sole individual to regard her with a stern gaze was also the only person bothered appraising immediately. It turned out that he was actually a decently strong adventurer; his stats indicated that he was at least D ranked, which in turn meant he probably knew exactly who we were.</p>
<p>「Take your places, we’ll soon begin.」</p>
<p>The old man that guided us over immediately began acting like a referee. However, he was interrupted by the less skilled adventurer before he could continue giving directions.</p>
<p>He approached the old man and asked him to remove Fran from the fight.</p>
<p>「Look, I get that kid’s qualified for this and all, but she really shouldn’t be here. I’m only taking part in this tournament in order to make myself famous. I’ll probably end up going down in infamy instead if word gets out that I ended up hurting a little girl like her just to get past the preliminaries!」</p>
<p>「Say what you want. I don’t have the authority to disqualify her.」</p>
<p>「Hey kid! Back out, right now! This is a martial arts tournament, not some sort of children’s game!」</p>
<p>He likely would have continued yelling at us if the other adventurer hadn’t called out to him.</p>
<p>「I’m guessing you just got here then?」</p>
<p>「Arrived yesterday. What of it?」</p>
<p>「I see…」</p>
<p>The more skilled of the two adventurers breathed a bit of a sigh. He seemed to have guessed that the other adventurer had only just in Ulmutt, and hence, had yet to hear about Fran. From that, he determined that convincing the other man was impossible, so he instead turned towards the judge and urged him to start the match.</p>
<p>「We should probably begin if you want the tourney to stay on schedule.」</p>
<p>「Come on! You’ve got to be kidding me!」</p>
<p>「Look, man, you’re wasting everyone’s time. If you don’t want to fight the kid, then just forfeit.」</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「He’s right. You’re getting really annoying.」</p>
<p>「What did you say!?」</p>
<p>The two mercenaries joined the fray, which ultimately caused the four men to enter a staring contest in which they all glared at one another.</p>
<p>（Master. Can’t just send flying?）</p>
<p>『Not right now. You’ll end up getting disqualified if you do.』</p>
<p>Fran was starting to get a bit frustrated.</p>
<p>The old man responsible for doing all the rep work seemed to feel the same way; he started the match because he didn’t really want to put up with everyone’s bickering.</p>
<p>「The match will begin in 5, 4, 3—」</p>
<p>「Hey, wait, what the hell!」</p>
<p>「—2 , 1, start! 」</p>
<p>And so, the match ended up starting despite the weaker adventurer’s complaints.</p>
<p>Both mercenaries immediately kicked off the moment the ref said the word ‘start.'</p>
<p>「Heh heh heh. Best thing to do at a time like this…」</p>
<p>「…Is to immediately team up and jump the strongest guy!」</p>
<p>Though both mercs were rather weak, they still did have a fair amount of experience in combat. As they worked in the same field, the two established a mutual understanding and immediately began working together.</p>
<p>I’d always thought of mercenaries to be the type of people that were capable of using all sorts of different weapons, but weak nonetheless. However, after being presented with live samples, I came to realize that they were in fact individuals rather skilled at cooperating. My guess was that they were most likely even more skilled than adventurers were in that regard.</p>
<p>The weaker adventurer immediately reacted to their words.</p>
<p>「Kuh! How cowardly! I can’t believe you’d gang up on me right off the bat!」</p>
<p>Wait, did he seriously think that he was the one that was going to get ganged? Just how in the world did someone as weak as him end up with <i>that</i> much confidence? Dude’s been rattling on about getting famous and all that, but as far as I could tell, his attitude wasn’t backed by his ability. I didn’t understand why he assumed he’d be actually able to get past the first round of the prelims.</p>
<p>「First up is you!」</p>
<p>「Oraaahh! Go to hell!」</p>
<p>The individual the two mercenaries immediately approached was naturally the more powerful of the two adventurers; they closed in on him from both directions while swinging their blades. Their choice seemed logical, as the man did give off the sense that he was rather strong.</p>
<p>But they were simply too weak in comparison. Both were sent flying out of bounds with a single swing of the adventurer’s sword.</p>
<p>「No way!」</p>
<p>「He was way too strong!」</p>
<p>Fran faced off against the other adventurer in the meantime. He really seemed to be the type of guy who wasn’t good at reading the mood, as he ended up trying to convince her to forfeit even now.</p>
<p>「Listen here kid. I hit ranked all the way up to E faster than of Corrent Village’s other adventurers. There’s no way a little girl like you could possibly match up to my genius! Forfeit, walk yourself out of bounds right now if you don’t want me to hurt you. This is your final warning, you hear!」</p>
<p>Did he end up turning out the way he did because the tiny ass village he came from thought him to be a genius or something? Is that how all this happened?</p>
<p>「So yo—」</p>
<p>「Shut up.」</p>
<p>Fran interrupted the weaker adventurer by kicking him in the stomach and sending him flying so far he almost fell out of bounds.</p>
<p>「Urgh!!」</p>
<p>He held his stomach and looked up at Fran with eyes filled with disbelief as he vomited all sorts of different things. It seemed he was incapable of comprehending the fact that she’d just sent him flying about 10 meters back.</p>
<p>「Will get serious next time if you still want to fight.」</p>
<p>「Hiiii…」</p>
<p>The adventurer lying on the ground in front of us was rather unskilled, but, even he could feel the aura of intimidation that Fran’s body had began exuding. He finally shut up and immediately rolled himself right out of bounds without even bothering to voice anything about shame or dishonor.</p>
<p>『Why’d you purposefully make him not go out of bounds?』</p>
<p>（Stupid and annoying, but wasn’t bad person.）</p>
<p>For that reason, she’d intentionally allowed him to choose whether or not he wanted to back off as opposed to just sending him flying further. I got where she was coming from, but honestly, I almost wanted to say that the way she did it was even more cruel than just finishing him in one hit. The way she attacked him made it so he wouldn’t be able to make excuses or say that he’d been caught off guard, which in turn might’ve just broke his spirit and made him lose heart.</p>
<p>「I knew this would be how things turned out…」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I doubt I’ll be able to triumph over you, but I will at least get a hit in!」</p>
<p>He drew his blade and attacked in a fluid, skillful motion, but failed to damage Fran regardless.</p>
<p>She swung her left fist, smacked him with a counter, broke his stance, and caused him to collapse on the spot.</p>
<p>「How… mortifying…」</p>
<p>And so, Fran ended up moving onto the second round of the preliminaries.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>

        
    		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>In the Waiting Room<br>
</b><br>
Today was the day we would fight our second preliminary match.</p>
<p>Its location, a large stadium, was practically the exact opposite of the the puny training ground in which we’d fought the first round.</p>
<p>The first round’s 1000 plus participants had been cut down to a measly 240. Soon, that 240 would be further reduced all the way down to 48.</p>
<p>The participants were split into 2 groups of 120, with each assigned to one of the two larger stadiums the event was to be hosted in. Both stadiums were known to get pretty full seeing as how the second preliminary round not only functioned as the first round open to spectators, but also the only public round that featured battle royale style matches. The 5 FFA format was actually quite popular, as people thought it fresh compared to the standard 1v1 format used throughout the rest of the tourney.</p>
<p>Another reason spectators enjoyed flocking to both this round and the tournament as a whole was the fact that one could gamble. Everyone other than the match’s participants would be allowed to bet to their hearts’ content. Participants were banned from placing bets in order to discourage them from fixing their matches. Match fixing was considered a serious crime and any found guilty of it would be put to death.</p>
<p>In my world, gambling had been an act that was often associated with organized crime and the underworld as a whole, but that apparently wasn’t something we had to be concerned with. Dias was rather strict, he was known for cracking down on and preventing it. Larger criminal organisations would always be destroyed the moment they were discovered. Smaller scaled organisations sometimes managed to find themselves staying off the radar, but none of them held nearly enough power to have their way.</p>
<p>Plus, the Adventurer’s Guild was the entity responsible for all the bookkeeping. They possessed the power, authority, and talent necessary to make sure nothing happened, so there really wasn't much to worry about.</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s go.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We still had a fair chunk of time before Fran’s match began, but apparently, all participants actually needed to arrive earlier than was scheduled. Hence, we’d planned to spend about 30 minutes in the venue’s waiting room.</p>
<p>Fran didn’t actually seem nervous. She was still her usual taciturn self despite the upcoming second preliminary round. Since we had a bit more time to spare today, she even ended up buying and eating a bunch of stuff on her way over to the stadium.</p>
<p>『Man, this place is huge.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The venue was a massive cylindrical building that looked almost exactly like a colosseum. Today was our first time viewing it from up close, but I could feel the excitement contained within nonetheless. The sheer hype amount of hype that filled the arena was only evidenced by the ridiculously loud cheers we heard booming out from within.</p>
<p>Fran headed inside through the combatants’ entrance at the building’s rear. Today’s receptionist seemed to be the kind that had their shit together, and so, we managed to make into the waiting room without anyone stopping us in our tracks. All of the other participants immediately turned towards Fran the moment she entered the waiting room. Most regarded her with surprise, contempt, or a sense of bewilderment, but she ignored them and found herself a seat.</p>
<p>To her, this was only normal.</p>
<p>There were a total of 5 different waiting waiting rooms. The tournament’s organisers had intentionally made it so people wouldn’t run into their opponents prior to actually entering the arena in order to minimize the amount of potential conflict. They’d also even gone as far as to set a rule stating that combat was banned within the waiting rooms’ confines.</p>
<p>「The hell’s a brat like you doing here? Scram!」</p>
<p>Unfortunately, people were people, and rules weren’t always respected.</p>
<p>One of the second round’s participants immediately started blabbing off to Fran despite the fact that he would’ve realized that she wasn’t just some random kid if he’d so much as just used his brain. A mere moment worth of thought would've allowed him to realize that she’d had to at least have some ability given that she'd gotten through the first preliminary round.</p>
<p>The man in question, a dude with a vulgar look on his face, went out of his way to rise to his feet and approach Fran. The fact that we combat was against the rules put me at a loss. I wasn’t really sure how to handle the situation given that we weren’t allowed to do the usual thing and just smack him to shut him up.</p>
<p>It turned out that Fran didn't share my sentiments. She knew exactly what to do, as evidenced by the fact that she activated all her intimidation-type skills without a moment's hesitation. That is, she immediately filled the <i>entire room</i> with an incredible amount of pressure.</p>
<p>『Hey Fran, you’re going a bit overboard there.』</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>Fran’s aura had caused many of the other participants to rise to their feet with the faces paled and their weapons drawn out of sheer habit — and they’d only been been hit with collateral damage.</p>
<p>The man Fran had been aiming her bloodlust at had lost control of his legs and fallen flat on his ass. He was trembling in fear and almost on the verge of passing out.</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Hii….」</p>
<p>He even went as far as immediately scuttling backwards the moment Fran laid eyes on him.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>Welp. It getting all quiet was good and all, but I kinda felt bad for what we did to all the other contestants.</p>
<p>They weren’t able to relax until after Fran cancelled the skills and bowed her head in apology. That said, their expressions had ultimately ended up remaining stern; most seemed to have come to understand their own relative weakness.</p>
<p>Yup, she definitely went overboard.</p>
<p>Everyone present remained dead silent, which in turn made the cheers coming from the colosseum’s arena sound strangely distant. Fran, however, literally didn’t give a shit. She simply sat down, pulled a glass of juice out of her dimensional storage, and started drinking it with an innocent look on her face like it was nobody’s business.</p>
<p>The atmosphere ended up remaining as is until another contestant ended up entering the room.</p>
<p>「Oh hey, well if it isn’t the Magic Sword Girl.」</p>
<p>「Nn? Lydia?」</p>
<p>「Hey, long time no see. So you’re taking part in the tourney too?」</p>
<p>The girl that walked into the otherwise tense room was Lydia, an adventurer we met back in Barbra, and a member of the Scarlet Maidens. She was fairly easy to recognize, as her face was currently decorated with its usual expressionless mask.</p>
<p>The fact that she was here immediately led me to assume that the other two members of her party were also actively participating.</p>
<p>「Judith and Maia here too?」</p>
<p>「Yup, they’ve also both signed up for the tourney. Judith’s over in one of the other rooms. Maia had to go to the other venue instead. But seriously, whew.」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「Well, it’s just that you being here means I won’t have to worry about fighting you.」</p>
<p>Lydia had seen the extent of Fran’s strength back in Barbra, so learning that she wouldn’t have to fight her had caused the older girl to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>「Our goal is to make it past the preliminaries.」</p>
<p>「Not win?」</p>
<p>「That’s just not something that’s going to happen. Both Colbert and Forrund are going to be participating, and there’s no way any of us could even imagine matching up to them. To be honest, we’re just entering in order to make ourselves better known so people won’t look down on us. Our party only has girls in it, so it's a necessary measure.」</p>
<p>The reason the Scarlet Maidens had decided to take part in the tourney seemed like one of the more common ones. It did make sense though. Getting filtered through the preliminaries despite the tournament’s scale really would serve to evidence one’s skill to some extent. I mean, that was interesting and all, but I cared much less about the reasons he was participating than I did about the other participants she had just mentioned.</p>
<p>「Colbert and Forrund participating too?」</p>
<p>After all, it seemed that two more powerful opponents had joined the fray.</p>
<p>「Uhmmmm… Could you not smile like that? It’s kinda scary!」</p>
<p>Hearing that Colbert and Forrund had come seemed to light both Fran’s spirit and her desire to fight aflame, as she immediately smiled a belligerent smile.</p>
<p>「Oh, yeah! Congrats on ranking up! The fact that you’re already a C ranker is really impressive.」</p>
<p>「Thanks.」</p>
<p>「Please go easy on me if we happen to happen to get matched up against each other after the prelims are done with. Please try not to hurt me, ‘kay?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I’ll hold you to it then! I swear I’ll get really mad if you make me hurt all over!」</p>
<p>I honestly couldn’t tell if Lydia was weak or strong from a psychological standpoint. But either way, Fran ended up getting called shortly after the two started to converse.</p>
<p>The clerk that called for us led us through a narrow passageway. Blinding sunlight flooded into it as we made our way through; it almost seemed to emphasize that the arena lay beyond.</p>
<p>『Are you ready, Fran?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『This is your last chance to avoid garnering the Beast Lord’s attention, so if you want to back out, it’ll be now or never.』</p>
<p>「Won’t forfeit.」</p>
<p>『You sure? Even though the Beast Lord might end up making note of you?』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>The Beast Lord had broken Fran’s spirit and left her trembling thereafter simply by standing before her.</p>
<p>But it didn’t matter.</p>
<p>Fran didn’t care that the actions she was about to take were ones that could ultimately attract his attention. The moment she learned of Kiara’s fate was the moment she threw away the very consideration of backing down. Doing so, running away with her tail between her legs, had become equivalent to casting away her tribe’s pride.</p>
<p>And that, she simply refused to do.</p>
<p>『Go all out, do whatever it is you want. Don’t worry about the Beast Lord. We can always just teleport the hell away, find ourselves a ship, and sail off to another continent if really need be. But that’s not something you’ll have to worry about, I’ll take care of everything if worse comes to worst, so don’t let your fears hold you back.』</p>
<p>「Thanks.」</p>
<p>『Alright, that’s all I had to say.』</p>
<p>There was no point in dwelling on what ifs. All we needed to do for now was focus on and conquer the second preliminary round.</p>
<p>『Let’s do this!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>

        
    		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>The Second Preliminary Round</b></p>
<p>Fran pumped herself up and stepped into the arena, only to be greeted by a stage of epic proportions, one so massive and well decorated that it simply simply couldn’t be compared to the dingy <i>thing</i> used in the first preliminary round. Its construction consisted of two parts, a round platform and the larger cylindrical wall that enclosed it, a large cylindrical wall. Around the arena were enough seats to fit over a thousand spectators. The place was beyond packed; every single seat was filled and then some.</p>
<p>Our entrance was welcomed by a set cheers from the audience, cheers so deafeningly loud that they caused my blade to tremble in response.</p>
<p>In spite of all that, Fran was as usual; she literally didn’t care about her surroundings.</p>
<p>Three of our four foes already stood atop the stage, one of which we happened to recognize.</p>
<p>「Huh? Fran!?」</p>
<p>「Judith?」</p>
<p>「Oh come on! Now I’m sure to lose!」</p>
<p>Judith fell forward onto her knees the moment she realized she was up against us. It was an action I honestly couldn’t blame her for. There was basically no way for her to win given how the fact that Fran was way stronger than she was..</p>
<p>Apparently she wasn’t the only one to have recognized Fran, as the other contestants had also adopted similar expressions of unease.</p>
<p>「So that’s the Magic Sword Girl…? Huh, she really was just a kid.」</p>
<p>「Don’t let your guard down. Her ranks even higher than ours are. I hear she's a C ranker now.」</p>
<p>The first round of the preliminaries seemed to have filtered out most of the weaker adventurers, as the only one of the contestants present understood that Fran was no weakling. The only one that failed to recognize her strength was the last to enter the ring.</p>
<p>「Hahahah! Why’s there a brat here? Isn’t this supposed to be a Martial Arts Tournament?」</p>
<p>The obnoxiously loud Blue Catkin that joined the fray laughed before taking a closer look at her and furrowing his brows.</p>
<p>「How the hell did <i>you</i> manage to get past the first round? Did you bribe all your opponents? Or were they just all pedophiles?」</p>
<p>「Strength.」</p>
<p>「Heh. Bullshit! You’re a god damned Black Catkin! No way in hell a wimp catkin like you could actually put up a decent fight. Know your place. Wait, I know. That old White Dogkin geezer must’ve pulled a few strings. That has to have been it.」</p>
<p>Getting a closer look at him allowed me to recognize that he was in fact a member of Blue Pride. Specifically, he was one of the two people that'd been standing by the gate and trying to convince Aurel to see them.</p>
<p>The realisation immediately explained why he was aggressive on both Fran and her benefactor.</p>
<p>「Just you wait, wimp cat. I’ll tear your jaw off so you can’t surrender, strip you nude and embarrassed the hell out of you before finally slowly beating you death.」</p>
<p>「…Talking really big for just <i>Blue Pride</i>.」</p>
<p>「Haah? What’d you just say?」</p>
<p>「You tried to visit aurel by lying and claiming you were famous, but you were turned away at the gates because your lie seen through right away. You’re just a group of weak, pathetic, small time mercenaries. And stay away from me. You stink.」</p>
<p>Fran seemed to have snapped given that she’d started speaking in longer, more drawn out sentences.</p>
<p>「You little bitch…!」</p>
<p>A large screen that resembled the kind you’d see in a sports stadium decorated one of the stadium’s sides. It seemed to be some sort of magic item, as it was doing as a monitor would, and displayed a blown up version of the interaction that’d just occured in real time.</p>
<p>The crowd’s response to the Blue Catkin’s remarks was rather poor. A few of the men had urged him on, but a greater number of women had ended up booing. Fran’s rebuttal, on the other hand, had caused the entire stadium to erupt into cheers. The man immediately popped a vein in rage, but Fran just totally ignored him and everything he said from that point onward, which, as one might suspect, only caused him to get even angrier.</p>
<p>Their interaction was one the crowd really seemed to like, as its members began to jeer in an attempt to urge the two on.</p>
<p>With the mood set, the match finally began.</p>
<p>The Blue Catkin immediately locked his eyes to Fran’s position and lunged straight at her. His skill with the sword wasn’t too shabby, and he came at her with nothing held back; it was clear that he planned to kill her. His actions caused me to want to scoff at how childish he was. He ended up completely losing all sense of rationality just because of the slightest bit of mockery.</p>
<p>Though, that much, I’d honestly expected.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>What I didn’t expect, however, was for the three other contestants to join him. They all immediately decided to cooperate in order to eliminate Fran, as, the Blue Catkin aside, they were aware that she was the strongest in the group. Judith happened to stand out from her peers, as she purposefully herself at the rear so she could the other three contestants as meatshields.</p>
<p>Both Fran and I were rather impressed by her actions. She hadn’t given up on winning despite the fact that she knew we’d be able to overwhelm her.</p>
<p>The unexpected four versus one situation put Fran in what could be thought of a numerical disadvantage, but she didn't mind. Fran simply didn't care that all four other contestants had ganged up her. She didn’t complain, nor did she bother calling any of the four out for unfairness.</p>
<p>Instead, she simply retalited.</p>
<p>「Fmph.」</p>
<p>「Guahhh!」</p>
<p>She swung me without bothering to draw my blade from its sheath and hit the Blue Catkin right in the jaw. The impact caused him to fly into the air before spiraling back down towards the ground.</p>
<p>Fran then struck again; she used the rising momentum that accompanied her first strike in order to deliver a powerful horizontal blow.</p>
<p>「Heavy Slash.」</p>
<p>「Kyaah!」</p>
<p>「What!?」</p>
<p>「Gyaaahhh!」</p>
<p>Heavy Slash was considered a relatively low tier skill, but it’d proven to be more than effective enough given just how powerful Fran had become. The attack sent the swordsman and spearman that followed the Blue Catkin tumbling back into Judith. Neither of the three were capable of recovering from the attack and so, they were all forced out of bounds.</p>
<p>Only a few seconds had passed, but Fran had already eliminated three of her four opponents. She could've easily done the same to the last of the bunch, but instead, intentionally chose to draw out her assault.</p>
<p>「Hiiii! F-Fwelp me…!」</p>
<p>She swung me downwards. In doing so, she caught the Blue Catkin in midair, smashed him into the ground, and caused a dull crack to reverberate through it.</p>
<p>「Gahiii… fuaarghh…!」</p>
<p>The blood in the Blue Catkin’s mouth rendered him incapable of anything but a few groans. He’d barely managed to hang onto his consciousness, not because he was sturdy, but because Fran had made sure to hold back just enough for him to do so.</p>
<p>「I… huwwenda! I huwwenda!」</p>
<p>「Don’t understand.」</p>
<p>「Horheit!」</p>
<p>「Still don’t understand.」</p>
<p>Well, yeah, it’s kinda hard for him to actually speak given that he doesn’t have a jaw or chin anymore.</p>
<p>「I horheit da hatsh!」</p>
<p>「Too stupid to know how to surrender? Well, can’t be helped since Blue Catkin.」</p>
<p>Fran basically totally admitted to knowing exactly what he was trying to say, but it didn’t matter. What did was the fact that she’d done onto him exactly what he claimed he’d wanted to do to her.</p>
<p>「Should strip and humiliate you?」</p>
<p>「Hiiii! I’m hwory! I’m hworry! Pweave, htop! Haf murhy!」</p>
<p>The sheer amount of bloodlust Fran’d been emanating caused the Blue Catkin to become as scared as he could possibly be; a warm, wet patch spread across his nether regions as he deliriously begged for her forgiveness.</p>
<p>Naturally, the referee had realized that the match couldn’t go on, and so, he hurried over to the stage and attempted to climb atop it.</p>
<p>Fran noticed him approach, so she immediately moved to deliver the finishing blow before he could stop her.</p>
<p>「Will end as requested.」</p>
<p>「Gobaaarrrgggh!」</p>
<p>She muttered a few words under her breath while swinging me like a golf club and sending the Blue Catkin fly right off the stage. She seemed to have gone a bit overboard, as he soared for what looked like 10 whole meters before finally hitting the ground.</p>
<p>I was a bit worried that the crowd would end up finding her actions distasteful, but it turned out that they actually ended up liking them as they immediately broke into applause.</p>
<p>「And it’s over! The young lady just pulled off the impossible and sent a full grown man flying off the stage with just one hit! Ain’t that just incredible ladies and gentlemen? It's not something you’d expect from someone with such a cute face, that’s for sure!」</p>
<p>Wait, there's been a shoutcaster this whole time? How the hell did I not notice?</p>
<p>The caster’s announcement caused the crowd to break out into an extra loud cheer.</p>
<p>「And with that C rank adventurer Fran, the Magic Sword Girl, wins the 11th west block and secures herself a spot in the main event without even drawing the blade she’s nicknamed after!」</p>

		<p><b>The Brackets<br>
</b></p>
<p>「Congratulations, Miss Fran. You have earned the right to participate in the main event.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran ended up having to visit what almost looked to be yet another waiting room after winning the match. There, she was met by a clerk who explained how things would work from here on out.</p>
<p>The tournament wasn't set to start still the day after tomorrow, but, tomorrow was going to be a busy day regardless. The matchups and brackets were to be posted in the morning and an opening ceremony was to take place around noon. The tournament’s participants didn’t actually have to participate in the opening ceremony. In fact, the clerk’s tone made it seemed like we were or more or less discouraged from doing so, which honestly only made sense. Putting a bunch of hot blooded warriors in one spot sounded like a terrible idea no matter how you spun it.</p>
<p>They even pushed the idea even further by stating that copies of the brackets would be delivered straight to the inn we were staying at so we wouldn’t even have head out in order to check them.</p>
<p>To us, not having to attend the ceremony was nothing short of a blessing. Fran wasn’t the type of girl that’d be able to sit still while nobles and other bigwigs went about with their long speeches and whatnot. Plus, the Beast Lord was pretty much guaranteed to be present as a VIP of sorts, and being around him didn't quite seem like what one would call the best idea ever.</p>
<p>We were also informed that the main tournament’s participants would be given preferential treatment at all smithies throughout the city for the event’s duration. Injuries could be fixed on the spot with ease. All one would need to do to restore themselves to perfect health was to either chug a potion or two, or have someone cast a few healing spells. Gear, however, couldn’t really be fixed unless you took it in for maintenance.</p>
<p>Luckily, there wasn’t too much new information to absorb, so we ended up leaving the arena not too long after our victory — only to immediately run into Judith.</p>
<p>「Hey Fran. It looked like I really didn’t even stand a chance.」</p>
<p>「Not hurt?」</p>
<p>「Haha… Only because you held back enough for me not to be.」</p>
<p>The way she spoke made it clear that she was feeling a bit down. Fran had no idea what to say given the circumstances, and so, she just ended up not saying anything at all. Instead, she simply looked at the other girl with a bit of a troubled expression.</p>
<p>「Oh uh, sorry, don’t mind me. I just wanted to wish you good luck and to tell you to give it your all, in part for my sake.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Oh, and make sure you win the first round! I’ll be betting all the spare cash I have on you!」</p>
<p>「Might fight Lydia if she wins prelims.」</p>
<p>「That doesn’t matter! I’ll still be betting on you anyway」</p>
<p>Judith smiled cheerfully while giving us a thumbs up.</p>
<p>With that, we departed, our minds and hearts filled with Judith’s half sincere, half greed-driven words of encouragement.</p>
<p>「Will do best.」</p>
<p>『That you should, for Judith’s wallet’s sake.』</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The tournament brackets were delivered to us the next afternoon.</p>
<p>We immediately began looking them over the moment we got them. The brackets were split into four distinct blocks, labeled A, B, C, and D respectively. Each naturally contained 16 of the tourney’s 64 contestants.</p>
<p>Fran’d been placed in slot A-11, which… honestly didn’t really mean much to us. It told us who we were up against and all, but did nothing to tell us how strong he or she was supposed to be.</p>
<p>『Looks like we’re up against someone named Zefmate…?』</p>
<p>「Don’t recognize.」</p>
<p>『He isn’t seeded, so I guess that means he must’ve at least been strong enough to win his way through the prelims.』</p>
<p>We decided to put Zefmate aside for the time being and look into him a bit later on. I figured we'd at least be able to learn a bit about his fighting style if we just asked Erza.</p>
<p>After shelving the thought and putting something on our to-do list, Fran and I immediately looked over all the seeded combatants.</p>
<p>「Forrund and Amanda.」</p>
<p>『Royce and Goldalfa are on here too.』</p>
<p>The four A ranked adventurers looked to be the tourney’s top seed, as their names were placed in the page’s four corners. Though some tournaments involved having seeded individuals fight less matches, this one didn't. There were exactly 64 participants, so it was fair in the sense that each and every single individual would have to fight the exact same number of battles to win the event.</p>
<p>As were were in Block A, the first top seed we'd end up encountering, if any, would have to be Goldalfa, one of the Beast Lord's escorts. He was in the same block as us, and specifically had been placed in slot A-1. Block A's second seed, Colbert, had been placed opposite him in slot A-16.</p>
<p>Having 16 seeded combatants meant that there were naturally four in each block. They all seemed to be quite strong, but Goldalfa and Colbert, the ones we'd have to fight, seemed especially intimidating. Both were capable of bringing Fran to the verge of death with a single strike. Fortunately, we knew about both their abilities to an extent, so we could at least begin thinking up how we could best deal with them ahead of time.</p>
<p>The first of the two we would face would be Colbert, which in turn meant we’d need to be able to do something about opponents that made use of Martial Arts. But again, he wasn't the only person we needed to defeat. There were so just many people we needed to look up and do research on — a fact that worried me to the point where I’d started doing mental laps.</p>
<p>「Kufu.」</p>
<p>Fran, however, wasn’t. The possibility of having to go up against one of the Beast Lord’s guards failed to frighten or worry her. In fact, it’d done the exact opposite. Hearing that she might get to fight Goldafa had pushed her battlelust over the edge and caused her to break into a smile.</p>
<p>『So if we win the first round, we’ll probably have to fight… Wait, seriously? Him?』</p>
<p>「Kurusu Ryuuzel. Don’t really remember?」</p>
<p>『I’m not surprised you don’t remember him, but he was that one C ranked guy that was there when we went dungeon diving with Amanda.』</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>『Oh come. He was the one guy that kinda functioned as both a guide and examiner at the same time. Dude was kinda handsome, but almost seemed kinda pitiable given how worldly-wise he was. He must've seen some shit.』</p>
<p>「Maybe vaguely recalling?」</p>
<p>Welp… It didn’t look like I’d be able to jog her memory, so I just gave up. I figured she’d <i>probably</i> remember him if she saw him. I was fairly confident Kurusu himself would likely recognize her on sight, as the impression she’d left on him had been a pretty deep one. It’d probably get all awkward if Fran ended up treating him like a total stranger, so I decided to make a mental note to remind myself to remind her that she knew him the moment we came across him.</p>
<p>That said, the mental note I made wasn’t really one I’d classified as anything even remotely close to high priority. There was a fair chance we wouldn’t actually end up getting pit against Kurusu anyways. He would have to win against the individual seeded into slot A-9 in order to actually see us in the ring.</p>
<p>『Looks like Kurusu’s going to to have to fight that old guy, Radyer.』</p>
<p>「Said he was C ranked?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, but he’s apparently as strong as a B ranker and even used to serve as a court magician.』</p>
<p>Radyer getting seeded honestly seemed nothing short of reasonable. I kinda felt a bit sorry for Kurusu; I really couldn’t see him winning against the old mage.</p>
<p>「Radyer will win.」</p>
<p>Fran voiced her agreement.</p>
<p>Well, I guess we'll have to figure out how to best fight mages if we wanted to beat Radyer.</p>
<p>『And if we manage to make it past Radyer, we’ll have to face off against Colbert.』</p>
<p>「Nn! Will need to try hard. Excited.」</p>
<p>Colbert was much more experienced than us, and even had a trick or two up his sleeve. He’d had something that disguised his stats, so we didn’t even know if the values we’d seen back then had really been his actual ones. All I really knew about him was that he had that a mysterious martial arts-type skill referred to as Demitris-Style Martial Arts, which was yet another thing we’d have to look into.</p>
<p>『And if we beat Colbert, we’ll have to fight Goldalfa.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Goldalfa, like Colbert, seemed to be fairly strong, so I didn’t doubt that he’d win his first three matches. I wasn’t really confident as to whether or not we’d be able to bring him down ourselves; there was a fair chance he’d be able to plow through us and win his fourth match as well.</p>
<p>「Will win!」</p>
<p>『Hell yeah we will!』</p>
<p>If we did beat him, then I’d say we actually had a fair chance of actually winning the whole goddamn tourney. He, as an A ranked adventurer, was someone strong enough to single handedly upset the balance of of a country’s military power so it went without saying that he was a likely contender for the championship title.</p>
<p>『Though, beating him isn’t really going to get us out of fighting all the other A ranked adventurers present.』</p>
<p>If all went well, Fran would have to fight Amanda in the semis, and Forrund in the finals, the realisation of which practically left her trembling in excitement. Both gave off the impression that they were even stronger than Goldalfa, especially since we’d witnessed their power first hand back in Barbra.</p>
<p>「But will still win.」</p>
<p>『That we will.』</p>
<p>They were extremely formidable, but I refused to back down. There was no point in me doing so if Fran actually intended on giving it her all. After all, victory was something that necessitated the right mindset; there was no way for us win unless we fought with that precise purpose in mind.</p>
<p>『Fuck yeah! Let's do this!』</p>
<p>「Master?」</p>
<p>『I was just getting myself pumped, cause we’re gunna win this shit!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>We’d identified what seemed to be our main threats, but that didn’t mean we could actually let our guards down. As there were many other strong contestants, there was a chance we could be caught off guard and completely obliterated by someone we hadn’t expected to fight if we didn’t remain vigilant.</p>
<p>Having come to that conclusion, we decided to once again look through the brackets in order to identify our acquaintances.</p>
<p>The first name that happened to catch our eyes was Fermus’. He happened to be in Block D together with Royce.</p>
<p>The second name we noticed was Erza’s. It seemed the tournament was fairly flexible and its managers were willing to accommodate people’s needs, as they hadn’t listed him by his real name. Erza, like Amanda, was placed in the Block B. I kinda wanted to see the two fight, but also kinda didn’t, as it’d likely be a showdown that’d determine which was the more fearsome woman.</p>
<p>The third name that caught our eye was the name “Phillip Krysten,” which happened to be listed alongside Forrund’s in Block C. I was a bit unsure as to whether or not he should actually be here given Barbra’s status quo, but figured he probably had his reasons for participating. Plus, he honestly had seemed pretty damned strong given what he was able to do to Rynford, so I was looking forward to seeing the full extent of abilities; Phillip vs Forrund was a match I didn’t want to miss.</p>
<p>Our eyes moved around the page a bit more and located the name Charlotte. I recalled her immediately. She was the young War Dancer that’d helped us out back in Barbra. She seemed to me like the type of person that’d fight through the rituals she performed with her dance as opposed to engaging in direct combat… which wouldn’t really help her given that her first match was against Erza. I felt pretty bad for her, so I at least, in my mind, offered her my heartfelt condolences.</p>
<p>Her name was the last familiar one we found.</p>
<p>The person we’d been looking for hadn’t made the list.</p>
<p>「Lydia missing.」</p>
<p>Wait, didn’t she ask Fran not to hurt her too much if they came across each other during the main event and all that? How could she actually not make it after saying something like that?</p>
<p>God damn it, Lydia! What the hell!?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>

        
    		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>Gathering Intel<br>
</b><br>
Fran and I stopped by the Adventurer’s Guild not too long after we finished staring down the brackets. Our goal was to figure out as much as we could with regards to all the other participants.</p>
<p>「Erza not here.」</p>
<p>『I’m honestly not all that sure he would’ve told us what we wanted to know anyways.』</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>『I mean, he’s technically one of our competitors, you know? Though, I guess he does seem like he’d gladly comply so long as it’s you that’s asking…』</p>
<p>Relying on someone we might have to fight against for information just didn’t sit quite right with me.</p>
<p>『How ’bout asking Dias or some other adventurers instead?』</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>Fran began moving towards a group of nearby adventurers so she could ask for a bit of information — only to be immediately denied the chance by the person she’d originally been looking for.</p>
<p>「Congratulations Fran! You did it! You made it to the main event!」</p>
<p>Erza dashed right over with a huge grin on his face, one so friendly it made me feel like an idiot for even considering him a rival of sorts.</p>
<p>「I watched your match! You did soooo well!」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「That Blue Catkin was really rude… You should’ve beat him up some more, mhm!」</p>
<p>「But might’ve been disqualified.」</p>
<p>「Oh… right, I almost forgot you weren’t allowed to attack people that’ve already surrendered. Oh well, I guess he gets off easy then… More importantly, Fran, something about you seems a bit different.」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「Let’s see… It’s kinda like you’ve gotten a more reliable. You've really got this huge sense of presence.」</p>
<p>「Trained hard.」</p>
<p>「Is that really it? Mmm… I guess that does make sense. You seem like the type that’ll grow at an explosive rate the moment I take my eyes off of you. I’m sure the tournament will help you get way stronger.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「So what made you want to come to the guild today?」</p>
<p>「Wanted to research opponents.」</p>
<p>「Really? I always thought you were the type that wouldn’t really care who you were up against.」</p>
<p>「Intel very important.」</p>
<p>「Yup yup! Totally! As for the person you’ll be going up against first… Hmm… I don’t know anything about him.」</p>
<p>「Don’t know?」</p>
<p>「Mhm. I’ve never heard of any adventurers named Zefmate before.」</p>
<p>Erza not recognizing Zefmate meant two things: he wasn’t from Ulmutt and he wasn’t anyone really famous.</p>
<p>「Let’s try asking someone else.」</p>
<p>Erza approached the adventurers seated at the bar and asked them if they knew of Zefmate.</p>
<p>「Do any of you know an adventurer named Zefmate?」</p>
<p>「Zefmate? Never heard of him.」</p>
<p>「Me either.」</p>
<p>None of the ten adventurers present had any idea who he was, which in turn led me to suspect that Zefmate wasn’t actually an adventurer given that some of the participants were in fact not.</p>
<p>There were also mercenaries, Knights like Phillip, mages, and other decently strong non-adventurers present as well.</p>
<p>『Alright, looks like he isn’t someone anyone around here knows. Let’s try switching gears.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Would like information on Dimitris-Style Martial Arts instead.」</p>
<p>「Oh my. Whyever would you need that?」</p>
<p>「Might have to fight person with it.」</p>
<p>「I didn’t know any of the tournament’s entrants knew how to use Dimitris-Style Martial Arts.」</p>
<p>「Don’t know why, but won’t use.」</p>
<p>「Oh, I guess that must mean the person you’re talking about is going through his trial.」</p>
<p>「Trial?」</p>
<p>「You didn’t know about the Dimitris Trial? They’re really famous. Anyone that wants to be an official disciple has to go through one of them. The trial goer needs to become an A ranked adventurer with a part of their strength sealed by a really special magic item.」</p>
<p>The trial apparently really was famous, as all the other adventurers seemed to know about it and filled us in with a few additional details. They told us that the magic item sealed away both a portion of one’s skills and stats.</p>
<p>No one present knew the exact details, but it seemed that one’s stats would drop by a minimum of 20 percent upon equipping the sealing item. It prevented one from using many of the Dimitris-Styled Martial Arts and also pretty much lowered the level of every single skill one happened to have.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>Learning that promptly allowed us to understand why Colbert had suddenly gotten stronger the moment Barbra fell into chaos. He must’ve undone his seal in order to help us kill Rynford.</p>
<p>Erza himself had partied with someone familiar with the Dimitris-Style Martial Art in the past, and had the opportunity to witness its techniques from up close.</p>
<p>「Though, she wasn’t too high ranked, and couldn’t do anything too incredible at the time.」</p>
<p>Apparently, the thing that made the Dimitris-Style so amazing was its focus on Qi.</p>
<p>Qi was defined as the act of applying one’s energy either within or on the surface of one’s body in order to either use it as a weapon or simply reinforce oneself. It was similar to magic, which used the exact same energy source to create the phenomenon known as a spell. The distinction between the two basically lay in the manner in which the energy was directed. Like magic, Qi’s strengths and weaknesses were dependant on its users skills and natural disposition.</p>
<p>「Dimitris-Style Martial Arts take the concept of Qi to a whole new level. I don’t know too many details, but I think they’ve started to mix the concepts of Qi and Magic together. Mhm.」</p>
<p>「Qi and Magic at same time?」</p>
<p>「Yup yup. Dimitris-Style martial artists can send their Qi flying or deploy it as a shield. I think they can also send their Qi into their opponents’ bodies in order to destroy it from the inside out. I’ve heard that the style’s more experienced users can do even more than just that, but I haven’t really heard any details.」</p>
<p>Apparently Dimitris-Style martial artists were able to do a lot more than just fire off the Kameh*meha. Being able to totally wreck someone’s body from inside out sounded really troublesome to deal with.</p>
<p>「I don’t really think you need to worry about it though. At least not for the purposes of the tourney.」</p>
<p>「Why?」</p>
<p>「Trial goers aren’t supposed to be allowed to lift the seal unless it’s to help people or defeat someone thought to be evil. You aren’t supposed to release the seal out of self-interest.」</p>
<p>Doing well in the tourney pretty much fell into the self-interest category, which meant we probably wouldn’t have to worry about Colbert undoing his seal, which, to us, was fairly beneficial. It boosted the hell out of our chances of victory.</p>
<p>「Nn. Understood.」</p>
<p>「Is there anything else you wanted to ask?」</p>
<p>We asked for details about Royce, Goldalfa, Amanda, Forrund and last but not least, Radyer.</p>
<p>「Radyer?」</p>
<p>「Good old Radyer? He’s a strong one~ He doesn’t have too much stamina due to his age, but he’s really well experienced. You’ll need to be able to deal with all sorts of magic if you want to beat him.」</p>
<p>「What kinds?」</p>
<p>「As far as I know, he can use Greater Earth Magic, Greater Water Magic, and Storm Magic.」</p>
<p>Radyer sounded hella tough. He was the only mages we heard of capable of using three different advanced magics. The closest to his level would be Royce, who was capable of using Greater Earth Magic, Moonlight Magic and Space/Time Magic.</p>
<p>We didn’t really know much about Greater Earth Magic or Greater Water Magic, so we were going to have to proceed with utmost care.</p>
<p>「Did you want to know anything else, or is that all?」</p>
<p>「Nn. All for now.」</p>
<p>「Mkay. Tell me if you ever want to know anything else. I’ll tell you everything I can!」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「But that doesn’t mean I’ll go easy on you if we end up getting matched against each other, mkay? We’ll have to fight it out fair and square. That’d be rude.」</p>
<p>「Know already.」</p>
<p>「Oh my, you seem really pumped and willing to go already. Fufufu.」</p>
<p>Erza was a bit surprised by Fran’s happy looking smile, but soon began matching it with his own while also returning her aura of belligerence.</p>
<p>Oh god damn it! Erza was a battle junkie too!?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>

        
    		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>The Morning of the First Round<br>
</b></p>
<p>『Morning Fran, you get a good night's sleep?』</p>
<p>「Nn…」</p>
<p>Fran was still only half awake, but somehow managed to have absolutely no difficulty shoveling her breakfast down her throat regardless.</p>
<p>『Today’s the day. The tourney’s finally starting.』</p>
<p>「Nn…」</p>
<p>I’d been a bit worried as to whether or not Fran would actually be able to get a good night’s rest, but it turned out that my concerns had been totally needless. To her, today was honestly just another day.</p>
<p>Our morning routine went just as usual. I washed her face, dried her hair with warm air, and gave it a good brushing.</p>
<p>『Today’s your big day, so we’ll have to make sure you look even cuter than usual.』</p>
<p>「Doesn’t matter.」</p>
<p>『Don’t be silly. Of course it’s going to matter, you’re practically going to be put on display.』</p>
<p>I finished styling her hair as I responded to her. Only after I finished that did her eyes finally snap open and fill with energy. She promptly began imitating my actions by brushing Urushi’s. The wolf narrowed his eyes and enjoyed the sensation for a few moments before flipping onto his back and demanding more affection. The way he acted reminded me of the Golden Retriever one of my older neighbors had in the past. He seriously didn’t give off even the slightest bit of the feral feel you’d normally expect from a wolf.</p>
<p>『We still a bit ahead of schedule. Feel like doing anything in particular, or?』</p>
<p>「Nn. Master, over here.」</p>
<p>『Huh? What’s up?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran grabbed a cloth and began polishing me off.</p>
<p>『We haven’t actually fought yet, so make sure you don’t tire yourself out doing that, alright?』</p>
<p>「Not problem.」</p>
<p>『But-』</p>
<p>「Because not just me.」</p>
<p>『What’s that supposed to mean?』</p>
<p>「Master also being put on display. Will have to make Master look cool.」</p>
<p>She continued polishing me as I brooded over whether I should thank her or tell her to stop. As far as I was concerned, Fran was going to be the star of the show, and I was just going to be an extra. I would’ve loved to keep contemplating so I could actually arrive at an answer, but ultimately stopped giving a shit not too long after she started because of how good it felt.</p>
<p>My loss of control led her to continue polishing me for a good 30 minutes, after which my blade became nice and sparkly.</p>
<p>『Are you sure that didn’t tire you out?』</p>
<p>「Still okay.」</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s head out then.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>All contestants were to report to and gather in the Adventurer’s Guild. Block A was scheduled to be the first to fight, so its members had to get to there extra early.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, we were immediately led upstairs by one of the guild’s clerks. It seemed that the rooms on the second and third floors were being used as temporary waiting rooms. The fact that the rooms were private rooms as opposed to larger rooms with participants aggregated within them was one that I could only possibly conclude as beneficial. Hot blooded adventurers, like Fran, would probably start fights if left with all the other participants.</p>
<p>「Please wait here until we call for you. Your match will be the 6th, and each is timeboxed to 30 minutes, so I believe you won’t have to wait more than 2 hours. It depends on how long each match lasts, the shorter they are, the sooner you’ll be up.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>「You’re free to observe the rest of the day’s matches once you’re done with your own, but you’re not allowed to leave the room until we call for you.」</p>
<p>The fact that matches were timeboxed meant you couldn’t really stall forever and just bore the crowd. It’d also prevent the tourney from getting thrown off schedule. However, it also meant that it was possible to run the timer. To that end, all combatants had to put on a magic item known as a Bracelet of Judgement prior to engaging in combat. The bracelet would allow one to determine a victor should the combatants eat up the whole 30 minutes they were allotted. The bracelet was capable of determining the contestants’ HP and MP values, as well as their relative consumption thereof. It would use the numbers it read to discern which of the two combatants would have emerged victorious had the match continued indefinitely.</p>
<p>「There’ll be a staff member just outside the door at all times, so please don’t be shy. Let us know if you need anything. 」</p>
<p>The tournament’s participants were treated like VIPs and could order the staff to do all sorts of stuff. A few examples of the services provided were preparing light meals and acting as a proxy in order to do one’s shopping. It seemed convenient and all, but didn’t quite pertain to us. The stuff we had in our dimensional storages served to more or less satisfy all our needs.</p>
<p>As a result, Fran basically ended up just sitting down and taking it easy for a while.</p>
<p>We weren’t bothered at all until about an hour passed, after which someone gave our door a knock.</p>
<p>「Excuse me.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「The fourth match has just begun. Your match will begin after the next one ends, so we would like to show you to a waiting room closer to the arena.」</p>
<p>It seemed like the tourney was a significant bit ahead of schedule, so we decided to ask the staff what was up. Apparently, what'd happened was that Goldalfa had lived up to his reputation and ended his opponent in what was literally an instant.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>Both the other matches, however, ended right around the 30 minute mark, and apparently not because they ran out of time. Most combatants naturally disliked having things decided by their bracelets, and so, they’d often pull off their biggest moves and decide things right before the match was forced to end.</p>
<p>We moved to the venue by taking an underground passageway with one of its entrances in the guild’s basement. It seemed like a pretty good measure to take, as having more popular participants waltz right through the streets would probably lead to the populace kicking up a fuss.</p>
<p>The room we were moved to was, not surprisingly, yet another private room, one several orders of magnitude more luxurious than the one we’d been staying in at the guild. The sofa they had in the room was gorgeous, and the bed was seemingly filled to the brim with down.</p>
<p>「The fifth match has now begun, so we may end up calling for you at any moment now. Please make sure you’re ready for us when your turn comes around.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>Fran dove straight into the super soft looking sofa and began enjoying it to its fullest.</p>
<p>After a moment’s consideration, I realized that the match that was going on right now was the one between Kurusu and Radyer — which meant the explosions I'd been hearing from time to time were Radyer’s spells. They were so loud that they even eclipsed the crowd’s deafening cheers, which I actually had to strain my ears in order to catch.</p>
<p>Unlike me, who’d spent my time thinking about the match and whatnot, Fran had instead focused on relaxing. She’d leapt off the sofa, jumped onto the bed, and played on it with Urushi until an incredibly loud series of cheers resounded through the room.</p>
<p>『Sounds like the match’s been decided.』</p>
<p>Given that realization, I strained my ears even further so I could hear the caster.</p>
<p>「And it’s over! Despite popular speculation, Kurusu has taken the win!」</p>
<p>Wait, seriously? Kurusu won?</p>
<p>「Master, something wrong?」</p>
<p>I must’ve seemed really shocked, as Fran had immediately turned her head towards me in confusion.</p>
<p>『It’s just that Kurusu’s the one that ended up winning is all.』</p>
<p>「Kurusu?」</p>
<p>『Did you really forg- oh, whatever. Let's get ready to go. We'll be up soon.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it.」</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for a guide to show up at our door after Kurusu’s and Radyer’s matches came to an end. Said guide not only led us over to the arena, but also handed us a Bracelet of Judgement along the way. Surprisingly, the bracelet didn’t actually take up an accessory slot, so we didn’t have to swap any of our stuff out.</p>
<p>The venue used for the main tournament was both gigantic and incredibly brightly lit. I called out to Fran on our way to the actual arena part because I was a bit worried as to whether or not she’d be nervous. Again, it turned out that my worries were completely needless, as Fran was in such a good mood that she’d actually been skipping along as we moved.</p>
<p>『Are you really not even the slightest bit nervous?』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>『Nice. Let’s do this then.』</p>
<p>「Can’t wait.」</p>
<p>『Make sure you stay in the shadows till after Fran gives the signal, alright Urushi?』</p>
<p>（Woof.）</p>
<p>The moment we entered the arena, we discovered that there were over ten times as many audience members present as there were during the secondary preliminary round.</p>
<p>They were so numerous that I found it incredibly difficult to discern individual comments anymore. There were so many different people cheering that the whole thing just kind of came off like a wave of sound.</p>
<p>「Mmph.」</p>
<p>The crowd’s cheers roared at such high volume that Fran ended up grimacing and lowering her ears.</p>
<p>『You alright?』</p>
<p>「Nn… Alright used to it.」</p>
<p>Whew.</p>
<p>The sheer volume of the sound waves blasted at us made me understand that having sensitive hearing wasn’t actually always a good thing. I didn’t get how rabbitkin like Royce and basically anyone else with super sensitive hearing could actually manage to cope.</p>
<p>「And our contestants have arrived! In one corner we have a fair maiden whose strength betrays her looks, the youngest C ranked adventurer to date. Ladies and gentlemen, please, extend your welcomes to Block A’s 11th contestant, Fran, the Magic Sword Girl!」</p>
<p>Fran slowly stepped up onto the stage with the caster’s announcement as her cue. On top of it stood her opponent; he’d already been awaiting her arrival.</p>
<p>「Mmph.」</p>
<p>Her expression immediately stiffened the moment she saw him.</p>
<p>「And in the other corner, we have an incredible man with a mercenary band at his back. Put your hands together for one of the younger generation’s most respected Blue Catkin: Blue Pride’s Leader and Block A's 12th contestant, Zefmate, the Blue Strike!」</p>
<p>Fran’s opponent was not only none other than one of the Blue Catkin she detested, but also Blue Pride’s leader. Knowing that, she glared him, reached for me, and silently drew me from my sheath.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>

        
    		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>Zefmate</b></p>
<p>Fran stared Zefmate down as the two stood across from each other at the arena’s center.</p>
<p>「Hey there, heard you totally wrecked one of our guys.」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>「Could you maybe do without the glare?」</p>
<p>「Fmph…」</p>
<p>Though it was in part because we were about to have to fight him anyways, Fran didn’t bother concealing her naked hostility. She narrowed her eyes and stared in his direction without bothering to say a word. He, however, responded not with bloodlust, but instead with a perpexled, bitter smile.</p>
<p>「I had Seiz punished.」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「I’m talking about the guy you beat during the second round of prelims.」</p>
<p>「Because lost to Black Catkin?」</p>
<p>「Nah. It was because he was far too rude. He shouldn’t have said what he did even if it was just for provocation’s sake. In fact, let me apologize for him. Sorry.」</p>
<p>「…!」</p>
<p>Zefmate caused Fran’s eyes to widen his shock as he gave her a prim and proper bow alongside an apology. She wasn’t the only one to feel the way she did, I also ended up surprised as all hell.</p>
<p>The reason for my surprise was a bit different from Fran’s. I’d popped the Principle of Falsehood because I thought he was trying to bullshit her to butter her up, but it turned out that his words hadn’t been laced with lies; he speaking from his heart.</p>
<p>「Seiz won’t be one of our execs for much longer. I’m planning to demote him because I feel that we really shouldn’t be thinking of oir treating Black Catkin the way we do.」</p>
<p>「Saying that even though Blue Catkin? Maybe not actually Blue Catkin? Something else?」</p>
<p>「Ahaha… I really am a Blue Catkin you know? Though, I guess I can see where you’re coming from. I understand that you don’t trust me, but I’d like to say that I don’t approve of the slave trade, nor do I plan on looking down on you just because you’re a Black Catkin.」</p>
<p>『Wow. He actually isn’t lying. Everything he’s said so far is true.』</p>
<p>（Huh? Telling joke?）</p>
<p>『I’m being serious. He really means what he says. His apology was genuine.』</p>
<p>My words prompted Fran to once again glare at Zefmate, this time, as if probing him. He, however, didn’t mind. He simply stood there exactly as he had been despite her looking at him the way she was — which made sense. There was no reason for him to react any differently given that he’d been speaking the truth.</p>
<p>「Can’t be trusted!」</p>
<p>It was a result that led Fran to flare up in agitation, an emotion I couldn’t really blame her for feeling. To her, Zefmate was basically the equivalent of a mafia boss, and good natured mafia bosses were a concept limited to the realm of fiction. There was simply no way for one to exist in the real world given the nature of their work. Hence, the result of the Blue Catkin communicating his intentions to Fran had caused her to be stricken with bewilderment, which wasn’t exactly what you’d call the best emotion to be feeling going into a duel.</p>
<p>『Calm down. You don’t really need to think too hard about what he’s said. It doesn’t change the fact that we’re going to need to beat him in battle.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Will attack first, think later.」<br>

<p>「Ready… Begin!」</p>
<p>Both Fran and Zefmate immediately began to act the moment the battle began.</p>
<p>「Haah!」</p>
<p>「Cheiyaaah!」</p>
<p>Fran gave into her frustration and launched an attack backed only by brute force. It was a bit crude and lacking in finesse, but more than powerful enough to end the match if it happened to land.</p>
<p>Zefmate defended against the strike by crossing his blades and blocking. He then began attempting to wrap his two swords around me in order to disarm her. The technique was stellar, but his attempt ended in failure for the sole reason that he wasn’t capable of matching Fran in terms of pure power.</p>
<p>The fight turned into a series of back and forths after the initial clash; both combatants continued to swing their blades at one another in an attempt to get a hit in. Though Zefmate was armed with two swords, and Fran only one, she gradually gained an edge on him and began taking control of the battle’s momentum. The reason she was able to suppress him wasn’t just because of her strength stat, but also because she was simply more skilled in the way of the sword.</p>
<p>Realizing that he was at a disadvantage, Zefmate took leapt a whole ten meters back and disengaged, an effect likely brought about by that Leopard’s Paw skill of his. The sheer amount of momentum it gave him was so great that it rendered Fran unable to catch up and immediately assault him as he landed.</p>
<p>「You sure are strong.」</p>
<p>「Not too bad yourself?」</p>
<p>「Thanks. You being both a Black Catkin and as strong as you are really seems to prove my point. We Blue Catkin really have been wrong to look down on your kind.」</p>
<p>「First time… Meeting not scum Blue Catkin…」</p>
<p>Fran’s emotions had finally settled, she managed to grasp the truth and accept it for what it was. The gaze she threw in his direction was no longer one filled with anger or hatred, but instead driven by curiosity. She had taken an interest in him.</p>
<p>「Ahahaha… Yeah…You’re right… We Blue Catkin really do have to stop acting the way we do.」</p>
<p>Zefmate’s laugh was dry, he seemed to be feeling both really depressed and somewhat awkward at the same time.</p>
<p>「Though I am still feeling apologetic, I won’t be able to throw in the towel or let you have the match else risk harming my band’s reputation. I’ll still be winning this match of ours.」</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Right back at you.」</p>
<p>Fran took a stance. She kept her guard up despite smiling and seeming a bit curious as to what Zefmate would do.</p>
<p>The amount of magical energy dwelling within him began to skyrocket.</p>
<p>「Fuh… Awakening…!」</p>
<p>His muscles began to bulge and expand at an incredible rate the moment he muttered the skill’s name. All visible parts of his skim were immediately covered by blue fur with black spots on it. His appearance warped into exactly what his race suggested — he became a blue leopard.</p>
<p>「We Blue Leopardkin are a species that specialize in enhancing our own bodies. You’d be best off not thinking of me as the same person you just exchanged blows with! Blink Strike Blade!」</p>
<p>「Gmph!」</p>
<p>Zefmate’s attack almost seemed to be paired with an instant transmission, as he almost seemed to vanish, only to reappear right to us as he delivered his blow. The strike was so fast that Fran was unable to counter, and forced into only blocking it.</p>
<p>「To think you’d block even the first strike…! Haaaah!」</p>
<p>The Awakening skill had boosted his strength stat by more than 30 and his agility by almost an entire 200. If one were to judge him based solely on his speed, he’d likely be classified as an A ranked adventurer. His assault was fearsome, and really ingrained into my mind just how much more powerful Beastkin became upon evolution.</p>
<p>Blink Strike Blade speed to be the type of skill that boosted one’s speed as one used it to attack. It, combined with Zefmate’s innate high speed, made him so fast that we actually couldn’t keep track of him with just our eyes. He seemed to be the most speed focused fighter we’d ever encountered to date.</p>
<p>He began using both Blink Step and Leopard's Paw to move around at super high speed in an attempt to throw us off while also attacking with Blink Strike Blade.</p>
<p>A ridiculous number of incredibly fast attacks came at us from every direction. If Zefmate were up against any weaker adventurer, he probably would’ve already completely torn his opponent to bits.</p>
<p>However, Fran wasn’t what one could call a weaker adventurer. Thus, he hadn’t even managed to get a single clean hit on her.</p>
<p>All that training we did had allowed Fran to grow much more accustomed to using her detection-based skills. Through their use, she was able to sense every single one of his moves — and that was all she needed. The fact that Fran could detect his attacks allowed her more than enough leeway to react to and defend against them.</p>
<p>「Impossible…!」</p>
<p>Fran’s sheer ability had led Zefmate to panic. Though he stated he didn’t look down on the Black Catkin race, he, as an evolved Beastkin, probably never even considered the possibility of losing to one in combat given that they weren’t capable of evolving.</p>
<p>He must've simply thought that he, as an experienced veteran, would be able to trump Fran, a little girl, in all of of stats, experience, and skill quality, and skill quantity.</p>
<p>The Blue Leopardkin’s attacks grew more frequent as he as he lost his cool. He stopped doing as many feints, and moved around much less between repeated offensives. His impatient attacks would’ve ended anyone that couldn’t keep up him. But again, Fran could. As a result, his assault only grew duller. His strikes became monotone, repeititve, and predictable.</p>
<p>「Stone Wall」</p>
<p>「Gabahh!」</p>
<p>A low rising stone wall spawned in Zefmate’s path as he closed in on Fran from behind.</p>
<p>The result mirrored exactly what would expect to see if a bike smashed into a guardrail at full speed; the impact of ramming into the wall caused Zefmate to flying through the air.</p>
<p>「I was read like a book and baited!?」</p>
<p>「Inferno Burst」</p>
<p>Fran fired a spell towards what I presumed to be the now defenseless Blue Leopardkin — only to have me realize that I’d been underestimating the effects of his Leopard’s Paw, as Zefmate kicked the air and changed his trajectory to avoid the incoming flames. His actions had been so far out of the scope of my predictions that I even ended up unconsciously clicking my tongue.</p>
<p>『Tsk!』</p>
<p>I felt like the only reason I thought it was over was because I’d decided to leave everything to Fran. If I wasn’t effectively functioning as a spectator with the best tickets in the house, I probably wouldn’t have assumed that victory was assured even after Fran fired that supposedly final spell.</p>
<p>In other words, I wouldn’t have let my guard down/</p>
<p>I would’ve instead acted as Fran did.</p>
<p>「Burnia」</p>
<p>「When did you!?」</p>
<p>Fran had immediately started moving after firing off her attack. She used the flames she shot at Zefmate as cover, got around him, and approached him from the rear through the use of Fire Magic the moment he attempted to dodge the attack by using Leopard’s Paw.</p>
<p>「Haaah!」</p>
<p>「Gaaaarrggh!」</p>
<p>Zefmate was fast, but so was Fran. She was capable of moving just as quickly as he was, even after he’d awakened.</p>
<p>To him, it must’ve felt like Fran had instantly teleported behind him, like someone had matched his speed. And that was something he didn’t quite seemed used to. He wasn’t capable of properly defending himself from her assault.</p>
<p>All he managed was to throw the sword in his left and thrust the one in his right in order to retaliate.</p>
<p>Both attacks, done purely out of desperation, proved ineffective. The sword he thrusted at Fran only barely managed to scratch her cheek, whereas the one he threw ended up getting tossed inside her dimensional storage.</p>
<p>Fran slashed her opponent’s legs as she pushed him out of bounds. She could’ve just sent him flying, but chose to rob him of his mobility as well, just in case he somehow managed to recover. Without his speed, Zefmate was sure to lose.</p>
<p>As a result, Zefmate had lost one of his legs, and with it, his sense of balance. He was unable to steady himself, and ended up falling outside the arena’s boundaries.</p>
<p>「Its over! It’s over!! I can’t even tell what happened! Ladies and gentlemen, that, what we just saw was merely one of the tournament first rounds! Can you believe it!? Both combatants were moving so quickly I wasn’t able to tell what either was doing!」</p>
<p>The fact that both Fran and Zefmate had dashed around as quickly as A rankers had caused the caster to start screaming in excitement.</p>
<p>「And our winner today is Fran, the Magic Sword Girl! Her victory has set a new record! She, as a 12 year old, has become the youngest contestant to ever win one of the tournament’s rounds!」</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>

        
    		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>Seren<br>
</b><br>
We weren’t left to our own devices until after we were led back through the underground passageway we used to get to the arena. The guide informed that our next match was scheduled to take place two days from now and that we’d have to arrive just as early in the morning as we had for this one. We were also told that we were pretty much allowed to do whatever we wanted in the meantime.</p>
<p>『So, what now?』</p>
<p>（Will spectate.）</p>
<p>『Hey, that’s a pretty good idea. We might make it in time for Colbert’s match if we rush over.』</p>
<p>（Nn. Want to see other matches too.）</p>
<p>Fran mentioning that she wanted to spectate the other combatant’s matches made me realize that we’d never actually had the chance to actually just sit down and watch other people fight.</p>
<p>I figured doing so would actually work to Fran’s benefit. It’d allow her to see things from a whole new perspective, which, in turn, could probably allow her to learn a new trick or two.</p>
<p>『Alright, let’s go.』</p>
<p>（Nn.）</p>
<p>Fran turned to leave the guild and head towards the arena, but was stopped by the guide before actually setting off.</p>
<p>「Were you intending on watching any of the remaining matches?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Planned to.」</p>
<p>「In that case, I recommend you wear some sort of disguise. The other spectators might make a fuss if they see you, especially since your match just ended and is still fresh in everyone’s minds.」</p>
<p>The clerk’s advice was spot on. Most of the spectators present for Fran’s fight were probably still at the arena, and there was fair chance they’d be able to recognize her on sight if she didn’t keep her face hidden. Some of the spectators might’ve lost a fair bit of money because of her, and getting involved with them sounded like a pretty bad idea if you asked me. The same applied to people that were <i>overly</i> interested in her. Actively avoiding pedophiles interested in her sounded like something that we'd probably benefit from doing.</p>
<p>「Then will put on disguise.」</p>
<p>「Please do.」</p>
<p>That said, we probably weren’t actually going to disguise ourselves too much. A quick change of attire seemed like it would probably be enough to do the job so long as we popped all our stealth based skills.</p>
<p>As such, all Fran did before heading towards the arena was throwing on a cloak. The tourney's contestants were allowed to enter through the back door, so she did. The guard responsible for watching it ended up not only letting Fran in, but also giving her a salute of the highest order immediately after seeing her guild card.</p>
<p>The place was packed. It didn’t look like we were going to be able to find a place to sit.</p>
<p>『Looks like there’s one spot free over there.』</p>
<p>But fortunately, I did happen to spot a single empty seat.</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The seat wasn’t broken or anything, so we were pretty confused as to why it was empty, and remained so until just after Fran sat herself down.</p>
<p>「Oi, where the hell do you think you’re sittin’?」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「Move brat, that seat’s taken.」</p>
<p>「That seat’s for our bro!」</p>
<p>There were a bunch of tough looking dudes sitting right next to us. They seemed to have been chasing off everyone that tried to take the seat.</p>
<p>A quick appraisal allowed me to understand that they were basically a few of Ulmutt’s local thugs. They tried to scare Fran away, but completely failed given that she was used to dealing with people much more intimidating than they were. The fact that they were annoying basically made it so we didn’t mind depriving them of their seats.</p>
<p>「Stun Bolt」</p>
<p>「Gyah!」</p>
<p>「Higgiii!」</p>
<p>「Orpghh!」</p>
<p>Fran stunned all three thugs and threw them into the aisle.</p>
<p>「Urushi.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>The people in our surroundings immediately stood up in surprise the moment they spotted Urushi, but Fran ignored them and loaded his back with two of the men while the wolf grabbed the third with his mouth.</p>
<p>「Dump somewhere.」</p>
<p>「Ruff.」</p>
<p>Fran saw Urushi off and then sat down, which, in turn, also caused the people around us to return to their seats. They didn’t bother talking to her though, seeing as how they likely thought that doing so would bring trouble, which, to us, was pretty much the best possible outcome.</p>
<p>Nothing in particular happened thereafter. We watched the remaining matches in peace.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we weren’t able to gain too much from watching Colbert's or Amanda’s matches, as both ended their opponents in an instant.</p>
<p>The match between Erza and Charlotte was actually quite worth mentioning. The crowd had really cheered for the latter as she danced, but she was unfortunately too weak to take down Erza.</p>
<p>She’d managed to to start dancing with in a rather bewitching manner, but her moves were cut short, as she ended up having to fight a desperate, one sided struggle in order to dodge Erza’s mace. In the end, she ended up getting grabbed by the nape of her neck and chucked out of the ring.</p>
<p>Though we didn’t learn much about Amanda or Colbert, we were still at least capable of learning a few neat ways to apply certain skills, ways we never would’ve thought up ourselves, even in our wildest dreams.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting combatants was a thief that buffed his opponent’s sense of smell and then started throwing stink bombs and other foul smelling shit. The takeaway we got from that wasn’t his technique itself, but rather the concept of buffing one’s opponent and then turning that buffed stat into some sort of disadvantage.</p>
<p>We’d also learned just how one was actually supposed to use Lava Magic in combat. The mage we saw use it not only melted his opponent’s weapons, but also superheated the ground for the sake of zone control. It was a magic that really allowed its user to take advantage of an opponent’s weakness. Learning more about its applications really made me really consider leveling it up.</p>
<p>The sun had started to set by the time the day’s matches had come to an end.</p>
<p>『Looks like it’s about time for us to start heading home.』</p>
<p>「Nn…」</p>
<p>『Did you want to go somewhere instead, or?』</p>
<p>「Still have Zefmate’s sword.」</p>
<p>Right. I’d almost forgot that we were still holding onto Zefmate’s Blue Dragon Fang Shortsword. It was a pretty strong weapon, and honestly seemed to be on the more expensive side.</p>
<p>『We should probably give it back to him.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We didn’t exactly think well of Blue Pride, but Zefmate himself didn’t seem too bad. In fact, I’d honesty had to say I thought him to be a pretty good guy. Plus, giving it back to him probably wouldn’t take that much time, so it wasn't like doing it would be detrimental.</p>
<p>『Hey Urushi, do you still remember Zefmate’s scent?』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>The operation was a go, and so, we had Urushi lead us over.</p>
<p>All in all, we spent about 20 minutes walking, after which we arrived at the city’s outskirts. There weren’t many houses around. The place was practically a large open field.</p>
<p>『Is this it?』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Set up on that large field were a whole bunch of tents. It seemed Blue Pride had chosen to camp out instead of staying at an inn, as renting out rooms for all their members would be a pretty sizeable expense. Plus, camping out wasn’t really that was tough on the mercenary band’s members anyways, seeing as how they were all fighters and whatnot.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px">
            <iframe id="iframea2" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="/ads/300x250.aspx" width="300px" height="250px">
</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>I soon realized, however, that there was a bit of an issue. We weren’t really too sure how we were supposed to get to Zefmate. We couldn’t just waltz right through the camp seeing as how his band’s members would probably end up spotting us and kicking up a fuss.</p>
<p>Maybe I could create a doppelganger and deliver the sword that way?</p>
<p>My brooding was interrupted as one of Blue Pride’s executives ended up exiting their tent and spotting us.</p>
<p>「Ah! It’s you!」</p>
<p>The person that’d caught sight of us was one I recognized, the stuck up, 17-18 year old girl we met in front of Aurel’s manor.</p>
<p>「Who?」</p>
<p>「I’m Seren, Blue Pride’s second in command.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Fran.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I know. You’re the one that’s completely played our band for fools. Why are you here?」</p>
<p>「Returning this.」</p>
<p>「That’s… my brother’s sword! You thief!」</p>
<p>Seren immediately began giving off an aura of hostility.</p>
<p>Wait, did she just call Zefmate her brother? I guess that’d be why she gets treated as the band’s second in command.</p>
<p>「Just how did a little Black Catkin girl like you manage to beat him in the first place!?」</p>
<p>「Nn? Strength.」</p>
<p>「Stop lying! Black Catkin are famous for how weak they are! There’s no way you could ever be stronger than my brother! You must’ve done something underhanded or cheated!」</p>
<p>「Didn’t.」</p>
<p>「There’s no way you didn’t! There’s no other way he could’ve possibly lost to a Black Catkin!」</p>
<p>Seren stamped her feet on the ground and threw a tantrum in a childlike manner unbefitting her age. She didn’t seem to share Zefmate’s views despite being his little sister.</p>
<p>「Ugh! Fine, whatever! If you want me to forgive you for being a cheater, go to the Adventurer’s Guild, tell them you cheated, and make them let my brother take your place!」</p>
<p>Fran’s eyes narrowed a bit because of how ungrateful Seren was acting.</p>
<p>「Refuse…」</p>
<p>The black catgirl’s mood was getting worse by the moment. She’d visited because she wanted to see Zefmate, not because she'd wanted to deal with this shit.</p>
<p>「Haaah!? What are you saying? I was offering to go out of my way to forgive you for cheating. You’re supposed to thank me, not give me attitude!」</p>
<p>I was starting to doubt whether or not Seren was really Zefmate’s younger sister. Their temperaments were… a little too different.</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>「Oh come on! This is why I can’t stand you stupid black catkin! I’m telling you to know your place!」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>「Why are you looking at me like that? I’ll never forgive you if you refuse! Do you know what that’ll mean?」</p>
<p>「Don’t.」</p>
<p>Fran responded in an irritated tone; she was only barely managing to not to lash out because Seren was Zefmate’s sister. Her efforts were praiseworthy, but and she did manage to hold on, but it definitely wasn’t something that could last too much longer.<br>
「Hmph. You Wimp Catkin only remain free because we Blue Catkin allow you to. If you refuse to forfeit, then we’ll not only capture and enslave you, but every other Black Catkin out there!」</p>
<p>Ah, she said the word. RIP Fran’s self control.</p>
<p>Seren had pushed Fran all the way to her boiling point; my wielder was as angry as she had been when Dias told her about Kiara. There was actually already no more helping Seren. Fran was going to kill her, and if worse came to worst, the entirety of Blue Pride would likely follow in her footsteps. I kinda felt bad for Zefmate, but it seemed to us that his followers were all your everyday average Blue Catkin. And if we were going to kill Seren, then wiping the rest of them out was probably for the better. They'd likely demand revenge if we didn't bother tying up all our loose ends.</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>Fran didn’t say a thing. She simply drew me and attacked the girl in front of her eyes. The attack wasn’t a well refined one. All Fran was doing was just lashing out in anger. Still, her strike contained more than enough power to reap the other girl’s life.</p>
<p>But my blade never reached her.</p>
<p>Instead, it cleaved the flesh of another.</p>
<p>「Gafuuhhh….」</p>
<p>「Z-Zefmate!」</p>
<p>Zefmate had dashed between Fran and Seren so he could function as a meatshield and tank the hit; my blade smashed through his collarbone and dug all the way down into his lungs.</p>
<p>Fran had just tried killing his sister, but, despite that, Zefmate's glare fell not on her, but on person he'd been trying to protect.</p>
<p>「What… are you saying…Seren…?」</p>
<p>「Zefmate!? Are you okay!? What the hell did you just do to my brother!? I swear I’ll never forgive you, or your kind! I’ll wipe out every single last Bl-」</p>
<p>「Stop it…!」</p>
<p>「Kyah!」</p>
<p>The Blue Leopardkin slapped his little sister across the face shortly after she began cursing at Fran.</p>
<p>He didn’t bother treating his wound, and instead just immediately prostrated himself before the person that had just mortally wounded him in an attempt to apologize.</p>
<p>「I’m… sorry… my sister… didn’t mean it…」</p>
<p>「Don’t… care…」</p>
<p>Despite that, Fran’s response wasn’t a favourable one. She’d been pushed way past the limit of what she could bear. Her anger could no longer be abated by a mere apology.</p>
<p>「I swear… I won’t… ever let her… say something like that… ever again! I’ll… re-educate all… my troops… and exile the ones that won’t listen… no… I’ll even force them… into slavery…!」</p>
<p>Zefmate knew that something like mere banishment wouldn’t be enough to calm Fran down. It was too half-hearted. And so, he even offered to voluntarily sell his own blood related sister into slavery.</p>
<p>His battle with Fran had caused him to realize that she was way out of his league, and that she might end up slaughtering every single last one of Blue Pride’s members if he didn’t manage to influence her mood..</p>
<p>「Wait, what are you saying? She’s just a-」</p>
<p>「Shut… Up…」</p>
<p>Zefmate clobbered Seren, knocked her unconscious and caused her to collapse on the spot.</p>
<p>「I’m… really sorry…」</p>
<p>His injuries were serious. He was on the verge of death, but he completely ignored his own safety and only continued to apologize.</p>
<p>I sensed the people that lay within their tents begin to move.</p>
<p>『Well, Fran, what do you say? More people’ll start showing up if you don’t make up your mind fast.』</p>
<p>「I’m… sorry…」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>『I’ll have your back regardless of what choice you make, so don’t hold back. Do whatever you want.』</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>Fran hesitated.</p>
<p>「Greater Heal.」</p>
<p>She couldn't make up her mind immediately; it took her a few moments, but ended up deciding against completely obliterating every Blue Catkin present. She didn’t trust them. In fact, she hated them, but her impression of Zefmate was a good one and she didn’t think he deserved to die.</p>
<p>「Will be back another day. If no changes by then, will take action.」</p>
<p>「Thank you so much!」</p>
<p>Sensing the fury that lay within, Zefmate dropped to his knees and thanked Fran for her mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>

<p>『You sure you’re okay with letting them off?』</p>
<p>「Didn’t let off. Just gave time.」</p>
<p>『Well, alright, so long as that’s really what you wanted.』</p>
<p>Fran began walking around town immediately after leaving Blue Pride’s campsite. The mood she was in was nothing short of terrible.</p>
<p>Zefmate had been a pretty good guy. Fran had felt that she might’ve been able to get along with him despite their races, and by meeting him, she’d learned that not all Blue Catkin were scumbags. Coming to know that had caused her to really want to become his friend. However, the circumstances had made Fran’s desire extremely difficult to achieve. Zefmate had been an exception. None of his underlings shared his mentality, which in turn meant that the two could potentially end up at each other’s throats.</p>
<p>There was a chance Fran would have to kill Zefmate in the near future.</p>
<p>To Fran, Seren’s words had been nothing but offensive. They were so sick and twisted that they’d even gotten to <i>my </i>head, so I could only imagine the extent of the rage that dwelled within her. Neither of us could stand the attitude that most Blue Catkin had, and we probably would’ve murdered every single one present if Zefmate had been even a second later.</p>
<p>The things that’d been said her continued plaguing her mind even now. They caused her darker emotions to swell and whirl around in within. I hoped that she wouldn’t encounter anyone that’d piss her off, as she’d probably end up losing control if she was to be encouraged to attack them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there wasn’t anyone stupid enough to do so given that her aura reflected her thoughts; she was emanating an air of pure danger, one that forced the people around us to look the other way.</p>
<p>She wandered around like that for about twenty minutes before suddenly turning heel right as she felt an incredible amount of magical energy burst out from behind her.</p>
<p>『I can sense the…』</p>
<p>「…Beast Lord?」</p>
<p>Its source was Blue Pride’s campsite, but it was so potent that we could measure the extent of its power from all the way back in town.</p>
<p>Sensing it had caused Fran to immediately begin dashing, not away from, but towards it.</p>
<p>The only person capable of giving off that much pressure was the Beast Lord. There wasn’t anyone else that possessed such a ridiculous amount of strength. Moreover, we didn’t even need to be present to tell that he wasn’t just training; his magic was laced with bloodlust.</p>
<p><i>Something</i> had happened.</p>
<p>Fran had no idea what we’d be able to accomplish by rushing over to Blue Pride’s campground, but continued to pump her legs as hard as she could regardless. It was something that couldn’t be helped given the circumstances. All we knew was that something had happened, something that involved both Zefmate, who Fran had a good impression of, and the Beast Lord, who she feared.</p>
<p>『Hey Fran, are you sure this is a good idea? I’m pretty sure you’re heading straight for the Beast Lord.』</p>
<p>「Nn…!」</p>
<p>Getting to Blue Pride’s campground took less than 2 minutes at Fran’s full speed.</p>
<p>「Hah…Hah…!」</p>
<p>『I knew it. The Beast Lord really was here.』</p>
<p>The first thing we saw upon arriving was the Beast Lord. He calmly stood smack in the middle of the camp, his body cloaked in golden flames. The second was Zefmate, collapsed on the ground, charred black, and clearly on the verge of death.</p>
<p>「This is what you get for defying me, idiot. Whatever, I’ve had enough of you. Just die already.」</p>
<p>The Beast Lord reached towards Zefmate with his flame covered right hand — an action that prompted Fran to react without the slightest bit of hesitation.</p>
<p>「Master, engaging!」</p>
<p>She went on the offense without so much as even waiting for me to reply; she drew me in her right, popped Deathgaze into her left, and shot towards the Beast Lord as would a bullet. The slashing attack that came out of the action was one as swift as the strike she’d used to assault Rynford; it was one that combined all her skills and knowledge, stealth-based skills included.</p>
<p>Rigdis, the Beast Lord, wasn’t all that proficiency when it came to detection. Rather, he was, but his wasn’t nearly as skilled at it as we’d expected the average S ranker to be. That, in turn, made it difficult for him to pick up on Fran’s sneak attack.</p>
<p>Ambushing the Beast Lord was a much better choice than calling out to him. Rigdis could always just ignore her and end Zefmate anyways, so attacking was, in fact, the most reliable option to go with if we wanted to save Zefmate's life. Besides, yelling at him to stop would mean announcing to him Fran’s presence, which in turn meant losing the opportunity to get an initial first strike in. All that, of course, was only valid under the assumption that we would end up having to fight the Beast Lord anyways.</p>
<p>It was a choice only made possible by the fact that Fran had already resolved herself to fight him. For that reason, her blade held not even the slightest shred of hesitation.</p>
<p>She ended up going for his neck in hopes of ending him right off the bat; her goal was to disable him in a single strike. She didn’t care about incurring the wrath of an entire country, nor did she give half a flying fuck about the international uproar that attacking the him would lead to. The only thing that she bothered considering was what she needed to do to save Zefmate’s life.</p>
<p>We didn’t have to worry about holding back, the Beast Lord’s Sacrificial Bracelet would prevent us from murdering him regardless of what we did to him. Though we were willing to engage the Beast Lord in combat, actually flat out killing him was something I wanted to avoid, as it’d put us a bit more than just neck deep in serious ass international shit. Attacking him was still a problem in and of itself, but, it was still a significant bit better than actually lopping his head off. You could say that we were only capable of going all out in our assault precisely because the Beast Lord happened to have a Sacrificial Bracelet on hand and equipped.</p>
<p>I was convinced that not even someone like the Beast Lord would be able to act if he was in a state terrible enough for him to actually need to pop a Sacrificial Bracelet, so I figured we’d be able to grab Zefmate and fall back before he managed to retaliate.</p>
<p>What Fran was doing was dangerous. That much, I understood. I knew that teleporting away and leaving Zefmate to die would’ve been in the interest of her safety.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t something the person in question herself would be able to accept. If I really had been totally concerned about nothing but Fran's safety, I would’ve long advised her to take uip a job less dangerous than adventuring. But I hadn’t. That was in part because because I wanted to go out and see the world with her, but wanting to adventure wasn't <i>really</i> why I'd chosen not to bother convincing her to change her mind. The other, more important reason was because I wanted to abide by her will. Fran wanted to be an adventurer, and that was that.</p>
<p>As Fran’s guardian, it was naturally important for me to try to keep her as safe as possible. That was simply what being someone's guardian entailed.</p>
<p>But I wasn’t <i>just </i>her guardian, I was also her sword. Thus, I needed to do utmost to fulfill her wishes, even if those wishes involved something as dangerous as jumping straight off a cliff.</p>
<p>As her sword, I’d already decided to follow right in her footsteps if she was to ever make that type of decision. And as her guardian, I’d decided to protect her to the best of my abilities regardless the of what the consequences of her choices were.”</p>
<p>In other words, my role was support Fran in her decisions every step of way so long as it remained possible for me to do so.</p>
<p>The Black Catkin girl swung both her blades to form a cross the moment she closed in on the Beast Lord. His defenses were ridiculously high, but we figured we’d be able to pierce them so long as we focused everything we had on a single point. The two swords that closed in on the Beast Lord’s neck… failed to do anything to him at all.</p>

</iframe>


        </div>
        
<p>Fran, both blades still drawn, stared at the uninjured Beast Lord with a look of bewilderment. She hadn’t felt any resistance when slashing at him, so she didn’t realize what’d happened until she looked down to my blade.</p>
<p>「Haah? Who the fuck are you?」</p>
<p>We’d successfully managed to stop the Beast Lord from slaying Zefmate, but Fran had fallen onto his radar as a result.</p>
<p>Fran lacked the composure to answer the Beast Lord’s question. She instead stared at the two hilts in her hands.</p>
<p><i>Hilts</i>.</p>
<p>Both her swords had lost their blades. In fact, Deathgaze was flat out done for, as all its magical energy had already drained out from within it. Even the Black Cat’s Mantle, which happened to have gotten a bit singed, was acting abnormally. That is, it was repairing itself at a much slower rate than usual. You almost couldn’t actually tell that it actually worked based on visuals alone.</p>
<p>The catgirl didn’t understand what was going on.</p>
<p>But I did.</p>
<p>The reason Deathgaze and I had lost our blades was because we touched the golden flames that cloaked the Beast Lord’s body. We both basically evaporated the moment we did. The flames didn’t radiate any heat, but holy shit they were potent. The lack of consistency between the two facts was one only made possible because the golden conflagration was born of a skill.</p>
<p>「Master!」</p>
<p>「Hah? Master? You’re this damned Blue Catkin’s disciple?」</p>
<p>『Calm down Fran, I’m fine. Don’t shout or throw a fuss. Just talk to me through telepathy, same as usual.』</p>
<p>（Whew…）</p>
<p>Fortunately, my blade was the only thing that ended up getting burnt off, so I was still fine and not yet irreparable. Unfortunately, the magical flames had robbed me of so much mana that I no longer contained any more than Deathgaze normally did.</p>
<p>『Man, this is looking pretty bad…』</p>
<p>Attacking the Beast Lord had caused me to come to understand that his flames functioned as an automated self-defense mechanism. They were <i>that </i>powerful even when just left in full auto mode.</p>
<p>I couldn’t really see myself successfully fending them off in the case that he used them to attack.</p>
<p>「Oh come on kid. Answer me already. Don’t just sit there with your mouth shut.」</p>
<p>「Did… what to Zefmate?」</p>
<p>「Heh, responding to a question with another quest? You Black Catkin ain’t got no manners.」</p>
<p>Being taunted by the Beast Lord caused Fran to grind her teeth in anger, but she ultimately ended up suppressing it and asking him a question regardless.</p>
<p>「Tried to kill Zefmate. Why…?」</p>
<p>「The fuck? Is something wrong with your ears? Did you actually not hear me? Ah, well, whatever. Fine, I’ll talk. All I was doing was punishing a subordinate real quick.」</p>
<p>The Beast Lord’s word seemed to insinuate that Blue Pride worked under him, and that Zefmate had done something that’d gone against his orders. Was it because Zefmate was pro-black catkin? Did that mean that the Beast Lord was anti-black catkin?</p>
<p>「So I take it you’re siding with him? Even though you’re a Black Catkin?」</p>
<p>「…Nn.」</p>
<p>「Huh, alright. Hey, you’ve got a pretty interesting sword right there. Whole thing just instantly fixed itself.」</p>
<p>I managed to fix my blade by using Instant Regeneration, but that didn’t mean I’d actually be of much use from an offensive standpoint given the Golden Flames’ effects. It looked like we were going to have to end up falling back on magic.</p>
<p>The Beast Lord’s element was fire, so we would probably need to counter him with either water or ice/snow. We couldn’t afford to be stingy with our skill points, I needed to invest them right away so we could make the most of our situation.</p>
<p>「Fran… Don’t…」</p>
<p>「Will save now, Zefmate.」</p>
<p>「Hahahah! What is this? A Black Catkin and a Blue Catkin acting all buddy buddy? Man, that’s so funny it actually makes me kinda pity you guys!」</p>
<p>「Shut… up…」</p>
<p>「Man, you’re still giving me that attitude? What a shame, I had some pretty high hopes for you. Alright girly, I’ll show you just how terrifying I, Rigdis Narashinha, the Beast Lord, can be. Lament the fact that you were stupid enough to oppose me!」</p>
<p>The golden flames that enveloped the Beast Lord’s body began to quiver and sway with a ferocious energy.</p>
<p>They were dangerous. It’d all be over if they so much as grazed us.</p>
<p>I got myself ready to teleport us out at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>Fran and the Beast lord stared each other down, both ready to immediately attack the other.</p>
<p>But they were denied the chance to act.</p>
<p>「Your Majesty! What in God’s name are you doing?」</p>
<p>「Ugh… You again, Roche…?」</p>
<p>「How did this even happen? I only took my eyes off you for a second!」</p>
<p>A man I immediately recognized as the carriage’s coachman suddenly joined into the conversation and began chiding the Beast Lord in a reprimanding tone.</p>

<p>Roche was a sort of hunter, specifically the jack of all trades type that could use magic in tandem with more traditional scout-like skills.</p>
<p>「I really can’t believe you… Why are you fighting a Black Catkin of all things? Have you completely forgotten why we came here in the first place?」</p>
<p>「Blame it on her, not me. She’s the one that decided to side with Blue Pride.」</p>
<p>「That doesn’t mean you need to fight her, you muscle brain!」</p>
<p>「That’s enough for now, Roche. Lord Rig, I’ve captured every member of Blue Pride that happened to have a hand in the slave trade and disposed of those that resisted.」</p>
<p>Royce calmed Roche down while simultaneously reporting in.</p>
<p>Wait, did he just say he dealt with the everyone that had a hand in the slave trade? Uh… what?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>

        
    		
    < /br>

        
		<p><b>The Beast Lord and the Blue Cat Tribe</b></p>
<p>Rigdis had already lost the will to fight. Likewise, Fran had done the same despite still being on guard. The reason for her sudden change in attitude was because Royce, one of the Beast Lord’s guards, had started healing Zefmate.</p>
<p>「Explain situation?」</p>
<p>「Your Majesty, did you perhaps forget to inform her as to the current circumstances?」</p>
<p>Roche immediately began questioning the Beast Lord's actions, or rather, the likely lack thereof.</p>
<p>「Uhh….」</p>
<p>「Hah… Let me guess. You provoked her by acting in your usual cocky manner without actually telling her what had happened?」</p>
<p>「Hmph…」</p>
<p>「Do you have any injuries, young lady?」</p>
<p>「…None.」</p>
<p>「That’s good. So, exactly what kind of relationship do you have with Blue Pride?」</p>
<p>「Zefmate… Friends. Hate rest.」</p>
<p>「Ah, I understand now. As for your, Your Majesty…」</p>
<p>「I know, I get it already. My bad, alright?」</p>
<p>「So? Why wanted to kill Zefmate?」</p>
<p>「’Cause he tried to protect his buddies.」</p>
<p>「Hah… Allow me to explain.」</p>
<p>Roche gave us a detailed explanation of exactly what had happened.</p>
<p>Much to our surprise, Rigdis was against the enslavement of Black Catkin. In fact, he’d been going around freeing as many Black Catkin slaves as he happened across.</p>
<p>That precise action had caused an ideological rift to form between him and his father. The rift was so vast that he’d almost gotten disowned,so he ended up organising a coup d’etat, murdering his father, and claiming the throne with his own two hands.</p>
<p>It was an act that he’d always suspected he might need to perform, and to that end, he’d joined the Adventurer’s Guild, tempered his body, and secretly built up his connections. The only reason his coup had gone as smoothly as it did was because he’d managed to make every single last one of the Beast Kingdom’s A or higher ranked adventurers into his subordinates.</p>
<p>Upon his ascension to the throne, Rigdis had promptly purged all of the spies and slave merchants formerly connected to the royal family. He’d then gone out on a mission in order to find all slave merchants outside the bounds of his country so he could free every single last Black Catkin that remained in captivity.</p>
<p>「But fought Zefmate? Why?」</p>
<p>If that really were the case, then him fighting Zefmate didn’t really make sense. The two seemed like they’d get along from an ideological standpoint.</p>
<p>Or at least it did until one considered that Blue Pride was effectively Zefmate’s family. He couldn’t assent to allowing the Beast Lord to murder any of its members, even if they happened to betray his ideals. The Blue Leopardkin had ended up begging Rigdis to let Blue Pride’s members keep their lives so he could rehabilitate them and fix their ways.</p>
<p>As the Beast Lord was rather short tempered, he ended up flaring up in anger and engaging Zefmate in combat upon hearing what he could only interpret as an excuse. That was when Fran had thrown herself into the equation.</p>
<p>Hearing the Beast Lord’s side of things made me realize something. His manner of speech was crude, but he’d never actually said anything to belittle the Black Cat Tribe as a whole.</p>
<p>He had said, “So I take it you’re siding with him? Even though you’re a Black Catkin?” not because he wanted to insult Fran, but because he thought it was odd for a Black Catkin to want to side with the type of people that sold their kind into slavery.</p>
<p>The same pretty applied to when he’d said, “Hahahah! What is this? A Black Catkin and a Blue Catkin acting all buddy buddy? Man, that's so funny it actually makes me kinda pity you guys!” It came off like a sort of cheap provocation, but was actually far from it. He hadn’t actually meant to insult the Black Cat tribe in any which way..</p>
<p>The Beast Lord’s intentions were further evidenced by how subordinates had ended up capturing Blue Pride’s members while we were attempting to engage him in combat.</p>
<p>「Fuck…!」</p>
<p>Zefmate groaned remorsefully.</p>
<p>「Hate me all you want. Just know that this is your own fault. I told all you Blue Catkin to stop with the slavery shit already, but your underlings ignored my orders and kept their black market dealings going anyways. And you didn’t even notice. Seriously man, that one’s all on you.」</p>
<p>「I… know…」</p>
<p>A fair bit of Zefmate’s regret stemmed precisely from the fact that he understood that he’d failed. He would’ve been able to avoid this whole mess had he just kept a tighter leash on his subordinates.</p>
<p>「How many… are still alive?」</p>
<p>「Approximately twenty, I believe.」</p>
<p>「Only twenty…」</p>
<p>「Lord Rig, I’ve found the pair behind the whole incident.」</p>

        </div>
        
<p>Goldalfa entered the scene with a pair of Blue Catkin in tow. And when I said in tow, I meant they were literally in tow. He was dragging them along the ground with the very same piece of rope their hands were tied by.</p>
<p>「These two are both connected to the Slavery Syndicate your predecessor managed.」</p>
<p>「Sennek, Tord, were you two really responsible for manipulating everyone into doing all this?」</p>
<p>「Hmph! Why the hell should we care about Black Catkin? Why do we have to go through all this for just turning them into slaves? They can’t even evolve!」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I know right! All we were doing was making use out of an otherwise useless bunch!」</p>
<p>The two old Blue Catkin spouted off bold claim after bold claim.</p>
<p>Both were members of the many mercenary groups that’d come together to create Blue Pride. They’d functioned as something along the lines of consultants ever since the new organisation’s formation. They’d always been in positions of power within every band they'd ever been a part of, and thus, managed to use them in order to engage in the underground slave market.</p>
<p>The two had intentionally raised Zefmate to feel repulsed by the slave trade. They’d done so because it then made it easier for them to fool those that they wished to hide the true nature of their business from. His sister, on the other hand, had been brought up in the exact opposite manner. The two had effectively brainwashed her to have her current scumbag-like mindset.</p>
<p>The Blue Leopardkin likely would have been able to notice that something about his band of mercenaries was off had the two not constantly been one or two steps ahead of him — they’d trained him to not only be pure of heart, but also the type of person that wouldn’t doubt his comrades.</p>
<p>「But I guess we went a bit too far. We trained you so well you became unable to shake that stupid sense of justice of yours.」</p>
<p>Sennek attempted to mock Zefmate, but was hit right in his sore spot by Rigdis in retaliation.</p>
<p>「Says a no-tail.」</p>
<p>「How dare you!」</p>
<p>『What’s a no-tail?』</p>
<p>（Long-tailed beastkin without tail.）</p>
<p>Longer tailed beastkin species put great importance on keeping one’s tail, as losing it typically implied cowardice. Thus, those that were supposed to have tails but didn’t were mocked as no-tails.</p>
<p>It normally wasn’t too much of an issue as one could recover a chopped off tail so long as it was immediately treated with either magic or potions, but, in cases where one’s injuries were more severe, priority was instead given to the limbs and whatnot. As a result, those with a lesser degree of access to healing would end up permanently losing their tails.</p>
<p>The old man known as Sennek appeared to be precisely someone that’d ended up in that kind of scenario. I’d thought that he’d just hidden his tail away in his pants, but apparently that simply wasn’t something that long tailed Beastkin with tails would actually do for reasons I failed to intuit.</p>
<p>Getting called out by the Beast Lord had, for some odd reason, caused Sennek to glare in Fran’s direction.</p>
<p>「I would still have my tail if not for you meddling Black Catkin…!」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「Fuck! How dare you look down on me like that? And with a face that looks just like that annoying brat’s to boot!?」</p>
<p>「Brat?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, fuck her! Fuck Kiara for taking my god damned tail! And fuck you for looking just like her!」</p>
<p>「Know Kiara?」</p>
<p>「Of course I fucking do! Fuck her to hell!」</p>
<p>It seemed Sennek hated the Black Cat Tribe because Kiara had caused him to hold some sort of grudge. That, in turn, explained why he’d purposefully raised all the Blue Catkin around him to see Black Catkin the way they did.</p>
<p>「But you know what, it’s fine. I don’t care anymore, because that bitch got sent right off to the Beast Lord! Hah! Probably got turned into a slave and forced into a straight up living hell alright. Gyahahahah! Bitch got right what was coming to her!」</p>
<p>Fran immediately approached Sennek with me drawn and in hand.</p>
<p>『Wait, Fran! Hold on! Don’t kill him!』</p>
<p>Ending his life here and now seemed like an act that could potentially anger the Beast Lord and his bros. To them, Sennek still had value, as he likely knew about others that worked in his trade.</p>
<p>Convinced, Fran sheathed me and instead started pummeling both men with her fists. I realized that she’d went too far by the time their already old, twisted faces had ended up even more deformed and bent out of shape than they were before. I figured it'd be best for me to stop her, but the Beast Lord actually beat me to the punch.</p>
<p>「Hold on kid. Hey, you assholes. When you said Kiara, did you mean the old lady? You know, Grandma Kiara?」</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> — </strong></p>

		<p><b>Kiara’s After Story<br>
</b></p>
<p>「Hold on kid. Hey, you assholes. When you said Kiara, did you mean the old lady? You know, Grandma Kiara?」</p>
<p>The Beast Lord’s inquiry caused Sennec to respond in a bit of a suspicious tone.</p>
<p>「Grandma Kiara?」</p>
<p>「She’s taciturn, blunt, and proud, but a ridiculously skilled Black Catkin swordsman nonetheless. I know she’s an old lady, but I can't remember how old. You happen to know off the top of your head, Royce?」</p>
<p>「Lord Rig, asking for our master’s age is no different from tying yourself a noose.」</p>
<p>「How ’bout you, Gold?」</p>
<p>「I'm pretty sure she’s in her late 60’s.」</p>
<p>Goldalfa’s response seemed to match with what we knew about Kiara. She was 15 years old 53 years ago, so she should currently be around 68.</p>
<p>「Based on what we’ve heard, I’d say the Kiara you guys are talking about is our master.」</p>
<p>It seemed that, unless I was misunderstanding things, Kiara was actually the person that'd taught Beast Lord to fight. Fran had come to the same conclusion, so she ended up closing in on him in order to demand a clearer answer.</p>
<p>「Explain circumstances.」</p>
<p>「You do know I’m the Beast Lord, right? How about ’bout you reword that a bit so it’s more polite.」</p>
<p>「Explain.」</p>
<p>「Oh god damn it. Fine!」</p>
<p>The Beast Lord began fondly speaking of his memories shortly after one last expression of indignance.</p>
<p>Apparently, the first time Rigdis met Kiara was in the earlier days of his youth. Back then, she’d been a slave that served the imperial court. Her duties mostly focused around garbage disposal. At the time, he’d still been been like any other young, mischievous Beastkin. That is, he thought the Black Catkin to be inferior, as per his father's wishes.</p>
<p>But that all came to change. His opinion of the race took a complete 180 degree turn not too long after he turned seven.</p>
<p>An incident occured.</p>
<p>A summoner from a hostile nation managed to summon a magic beast in the royal palace. Back then, the Beast Kingdom had been at war with a neighbouring country, hence, most of the palace's more competent fighters had been sent to the battlefield. As the guards and soldiers responsible for the palace were relatively weak, the place was basically instantly overrun. Both Goldalfa, who’d just enlisted, and Royce, who’d only just started learning magic, had been dealt serious wounds.</p>
<p>The situation looked grim. None of the troops left within the palace’s confines were capable of dealing with the Tyrant Saber Tiger that’d invaded it. To Rigdis, it had seemed like he was left no choice but to abandon the palace.</p>
<p>Or at least that was how he felt until <i>she</i> took action.</p>
<p>A Black Catkin slave ended up doing what none of the soldiers could and took down the Magic Beast. The Tyrant Saber Tiger itself wasn’t a particularly strong one, it was still young, and yet to reach maturity, but it was still a C rank threat regardless.</p>
<p>Thus, he simply failed to process the fact that she’d easily slain it while armed with only a mop.</p>
<p>Bearing witness to the Black Catkin slave’s technique had caused Rigdis to take interest in her. He snuck around and eventually managed to speak to her, only to find that she was named Kiara, and that she had a blunt, straightforward personality. At the time, Rigdis hadn’t had any friends, so he immediately grew attached to her.</p>
<p>The mix of his attachment to and admiration for her caused him to ask her to take him as her disciple, and so, she soon began teaching him the art of combat.</p>
<p>Her instruction was ridiculously tough, but proved more than effective as it caused Rigdis to become much stronger in a fairly short period of time. Noticing his rapid progress, both Goldalfa and Royce followed his example and became Kiara’s disciples.</p>
<p>Since Kiara couldn’t be seen instructing the group in public, they were forced to train in a secluded area away from the public's eyes. Specifically, the location they made their own was the garbage disposal site, a place that smelled so awful it automatically warded off any and all unwelcome visitors.</p>
<p>Rigdis had offered Kiara freedom, but she firmly refused it. His father had threatened her and told her that he would murder her tribesman should she escape.</p>
<p>The only reason Rigdis’ father had let her live was because he’d suspected that she would come of use in the future.</p>
<p>Learning of her circumstances caused Rigdis to begin wondering why the Black Catkin were treated as they were. He started to investigate the mysteries surrounding their inability to evolve while also functioning to protect them.</p>
<p>Upon reaching adulthood, Rigdis was informed of a secret known only to the royal family’s members, a piece of information that revealed why his predecessors regarded Black Catkin the way they did. With said secret, he also learned the reason why the Black Cat Tribe’s members had become incapable of evolution.</p>
<p>「My old man told me everything because he wanted to open my eyes to his cause. Wanted to tell me to stop doing something as stupid as protecting Black Catkin.」</p>
<p>But it didn’t work. In fact, telling Rigdis the truth had the opposite effect his father had been hoping for, as, to him, the truth simply reinforced the idea that looking down upon the Black Cat Tribe was nothing short of a mistake.</p>
<p>Thus, Rigdis and his father ended up in conflict for many years, with the former eventually beating out the latter through a coup.</p>
<p>（Master?）</p>
<p>『Doesn’t look like he’s lying.』</p>
<p>Something this important obviously called for verification through the Principle of Falsehood. Using it allowed me to determine that the Beast Lord’s words were almost entirely free of lies. The only times my lie detector ever went off was when he insulted Kiara or called her by a nickname that made it seem like he didn’t respect her. Conversely, it didn’t go off when he referred to her as his master. In other words, all the Principle of Falsehood had done was inform us that the Beast Lord was a veritable tsundere. [1]</p>

        </div>
        
<p>「Kiara, doing what now?」</p>
<p>「Our master has gotten old, so she’s effectively retired and just living within the castle. She spends most of her time sleeping, but will occasionally see to our soldiers if she feels up to the job.」</p>
<p>Royce followed up the Beast Lord as he paused to take a breath.</p>
<p>「The royal palace has moved on from looking down on Black Catkin. None of the people that work and live within it are willing to insult them any longer.」</p>
<p>「That’s impossible! Black Catkin are an inferior race! Why else do you think we Blue Catkin have been pushing them around for all these years!?」</p>
<p>Sennek responded to the rabbitkin's words with a violent shout.</p>
<p>「The palace functions off a meritocratic system. We don’t evaluate people based on their race, only their competence. Though, I admit we’ve been giving the Black Catkin a bit more leeway to make up for all that they’ve suffered.」</p>
<p>The Beast Lord casually refuted Sennec’s declaration.</p>
<p>「I assume you haven’t heard about what’s happened to the Blue Cat Tribe as of late.」</p>
<p>According to Royce, most beastkin had recently started ostracizing the Blue Cat Tribe. There were two reasons that functioned as the driving force behind the aforementioned movement. The first was that most other beastkin had a bit of a hard time trusting the Blue Cat Tribe knowing that they’d sold other Beastkin into slavery. While most other Beastkin did indeed look down on Black Catkin, they never went as far as treating them as slaves. The reason the Blue Catkin's treatment of the Black Catkin was so much harsher than all the other tribes' was because the Black Catkin used to have a higher social status than the Blue Catkin. This caused the Blue Catkin a lot of grief, and led to them going wild the moment their social positions were flipped.</p>
<p>The second reason was because the Blue Cat Tribe was regarded to be in decline. Their business dealings allowed the Blue Catkin to live luxurious lives, so few became true warriors, and even fewer trained themselves as hard as Zefmate had. As a result, the number of Blue Leopardkin had plummeted far beyond just a noticeable degree. This, in part, was the fault of the Beast Lord’s ancestors. The Beast Lords of the past had ordered the Blue Catkin to become slave traders and persecuted all that dared disobey. Hence, most of today’s Blue Catkin were the descendants of slave traders as opposed to the descendents of warriors.</p>
<p>In other words, most other Beastkin looked down on the Blue Cat Tribe both because they were weak and because they were repulsive from a psychological standpoint.</p>
<p>Fran didn’t really care for the details nor Sennek’s reply, so she ended up asking more about Kiara instead.</p>
<p>「Happy as long as Kiara is alive. Okay to tell other people?」</p>
<p>「Other people? Whaddya mean other people?」</p>
<p>「Dias and Aurel, Kiara’s acquaintances. Worried about her since didn’t know what happened to her after she was taken away by Beast Lord.」</p>
<p>Hearing Fran’s question caused the Beast Lord to nod as if he had come to a sudden understanding.</p>
<p>「Huh. I guess that’s why they’ve been treating me with that hostile ass attitude. That explains that. Yeah, I don’t mind at all, go right the hell ahead. In fact, how ’bout I tell them myself right after we’re done here. Was planning to pay the both of them a few visits anyway.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Do tell」</p>
<p>「I’m pretty sure you have lots to ask me, but I’m too busy for it right now. I’ll answer all your questions after the tournament’s over, so check in with me once it’s done.」</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>「Aight. I’ll be looking forward to seeing how you do. Show me that you’ll at least be capable of getting to the fourth round. There won’t really be a point in me telling you anything unless you can.」</p>
<p>The Beast Lord grinned at Fran in an intimidating manner, but this time, she didn’t freak out. In fact, she responded to him by speaking in a motivated sounding tone.</p>
<p>「Planned to win from start.」</p>
<p>「Hahahahahahah! You hear that, Gold? Royce?」</p>
<p>「It sure is nice seeing a young fighter all pumped up and motivated.」</p>
<p>「Indeed, but I won’t show her even the slightest shred of mercy should we meet in the ring.」</p>
<p>「Bring it on.」</p>
<p>「Buhahahaha! I like the way you talk smack, even to Gold and Royce. Fine then Fran, come visit me after you’ve won the tournament. I’ll look forward to seeing you then.」</p>
<p>The Beast Lord let loose a hearty laugh before entering the tent in which the remaining Blue Catkin were being kept.</p>
<p>This caused Fran’s expression to change to one of worry, so Royce ended up ushering her off.</p>
<p>「What happens from this point onwards is the Beast Kingdom’s business, so how about you head home for now?」</p>
<p>「What do to Zefmate?」</p>
<p>「Disobeying the Beast Lord is a crime, but I doubt Rig will do too much to harm Zefmate. He’s taken a liking to him, after all.」</p>
<p>「…Got it.」</p>
<p>The Beast Lord was the kind of guy that tended to be a bit rough around the edges, but the fact that he liked Zefmate meant that he probably wouldn’t execute him or shove him in some sort of prison.</p>
<p>Royce’s words seemed to have offered Fran enough to allow her to relax, so she bowed to him before finally turning around and leaving the area.</p>
<p>『Welp. Looks like we’re going to have at least win ourselves three rounds if we want his approval.』</p>
<p>「Nn! Master. Will try hardest from now on.」</p>
<p>『Sure thing.』</p>
<p>「Nn! Will win for sure!」</p>

		<p><b>Vs. Kurusu<br>
</b><br>
Fran, Urushi, and I idled about in the waiting room as the second round drew closer. Our match was the third, and the first had already begun, so we were guaranteed to take the stage in less than hour.</p>
<p>A lot had happened yesterday, but none of it had functioned to discourage Fran. In fact, I’d say that the events that’d transpired ended up motivating her more than anything else; she now was practically dead set on at least making it past the tourney’s third round.</p>
<p>The fact that the Beast Lord was going around crushing Blue Cat slave traders made her feel a sense of satisfaction, so she’d recently started acting in a much less aggressive manner than she otherwise normally would have. That said, she would still do the usual and beat up any that attempted harassing her. Though she didn’t seem to realize it herself, it seemed that hitting them wasn’t enough to dispose of all the stress they brought, and as a result, she’d been on edge for the past day and a bit. To be honest, her much more frequent interactions with Blue Catkin weren’t the only reason she was so much sharper than usual. Participating in the tourney, in and of itself, had also put her in a more belligerent mood.</p>
<p>Given that our match was coming up soon, Fran decided to warm herself up. Namely, she swung me a bit and practiced dodging by having Urushi jump at her.</p>
<p>『Our turn’ll be coming up soon, so don’t push yourselves too hard just yet, alright?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Both Fran and Urushi continued to accelerate despite voicing their agreements. The pair had already gotten so fast that their actions had become indiscernible to the average person. That, however, wasn’t enough to make me stop them, as to Fran, her current actions were pretty much the equivalent of a walk in the park.</p>
<p>A clerk came knocking not too long after the two started warming up. I was honestly surprised with how quickly it came; we’d only been waiting for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>「Excuse me, Miss Fran? The second round is over. It’ll soon be your turn, so please get ready.」</p>
<p>Asking the clerk allowed us to confirm that Goldalfa had once again ended his opponent in an instant.</p>
<p>Yeah, beating him definitely looked like it wasn’t going to be easy.</p>
<p>「Please follow me.」</p>
<p>『Oh yeah, Fran, don’t forget to say something like “nice to see you again,” when we run into Kurusu. We have met him already after all.』</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>『Make sure you do, alright? Don’t pretend you forgot who he is, okay?』</p>
<p>「No problem.」</p>
<p>Hmm… I couldn’t help but feel a bit worried. Fran seemed to have totally forgotten that Kurusu existed, but he was still technically a C ranker and therefore not exactly what you could call a small fry.</p>
<p>The impression I had of him was that he was the leader type as opposed to the type that was actually all that skilled in single combat. But that impression didn't really hold. He seemed a bit different this time around. The man we found upon climbing our way onto the stage had a sort of fierce air to him.</p>
<p>「You’re not someone I ever expected to see here.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『Huh, is that really supposed to be Kurusu? He seems a lot more… wild than he did last time we saw him.』</p>

<p>It looked like he’d switched from being a Blink Swordsman to being a Mad Swordsman. As a result, he’d lost a fair bit of vitality and dexterity in exchange for a boost in his strength and agility. In other words, his role seemed to have transitioned into that of an all out attacker.</p>
<p>Seeing his face had finally caused Fran to recognize him, but she ended up a bit confused because of the disparity between how he was now and how he was before.</p>
<p>「What happened?」</p>
<p>「Fufufu. That’s a mean question to ask.」</p>
<p>「Different feel.」</p>
<p>「Seeing the way you and Amanda fought let me to contemplate a few things and alter my own style a bit. I just so happened to get a bit too immersed in retraining myself is all.」</p>
<p>In other words, seeing Fran and Amanda go at each other had caused him to go into shock and question his own abilities. Thus, he ended up trying a few things and adopting whatever he thought was best.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>Personally, I think he probably changed a bit <i>too</i> much.</p>
<p>「This is perfect. I knew going into this that I’d never be able to catch up to you, but fighting you is still exactly what I needed to see just how far I’ve come!」</p>
<p>Kurusu drew his blade, a longsword carved from the fang of a Tyrant Sabertiger. It was something we had to be careful of, as it had the Vibration Fang skill.</p>
<p>「You’ve even ended up matching my rank. I guess that means I’ll have to make sure I don’t disgrace myself.」</p>
<p>「Also won’t lose.」</p>
<p>Fran drew me and took a stance.</p>
<p>The caster seemed to take that as a signal of sorts, and immediately declared that the match had begun.</p>
<p>「Here I go! Madness, activate!」</p>
<p>Kurusu immediately threw his defenses out the window and cast a buff that caused him to focus purely on offense; he chose attempt to hit her before she hit him. It wasn’t a bad choice, as he knew that Fran’s offenses would’ve overwhelmed his defenses either way.</p>
<p>「Down Break!」</p>
<p>The Mad Swordsman’s training had evidently paid off. He’d raised his stats and discovered for himself a new way of engaging in combat.</p>
<p>But he wasn’t the only one to have grown stronger.</p>
<p>Fran had done the same, and unfortunately for Kurusu, the changes in her stats had been much more dramatic than the changes in his.</p>
<p>The gap between him and her was even wider than it’d been back in Alessa.</p>
<p>「Haaah!」</p>
<p>「Slow.」</p>
<p>「Gah!」</p>
<p>Fran easily sidestepped Kurusu’s downwards swing before countering by directing her blade towards his sword arm.</p>
<p>Realizing her intentions, Kurusu forced his left arm between him and me in order to trade it in and save his right.</p>
<p>「Forfeit?」</p>
<p>「Fufu. Not yet. My left may be done for, but I’ve still got my right!」</p>
<p>「Thought so.」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>Fran took the initiative and went on the offensive. Her foe was able to avoid her first two attacks, but that was it. The loss of a hand had caused him to lose his ability to balance, which, in turn, caused her third strike to embed itself within his body. Naturally, it didn’t just end there. She aimed me at his right hand and attempted to strike it once more in order to form him to surrender.</p>
<p>But he still didn’t give up.</p>
<p>「Last Stand!」</p>
<p>Kurusu’s body began glowing the moment he shouted the skill’s name.</p>
<p>I sensed a sudden influx of mana, so I decided to appraise him. Doing so allowed me to figure out that he’d lost most of his HP, but gained a massive boost to all his stats. He’d even gotten the Nullified Sense of Pain skill to boot.</p>
<p>The skill he’d just used was one that could only be used when on the verge of death.</p>
<p>「Gaaaahhh!」</p>
<p>「Mmph!」</p>
<p>The Mad Swordsman didn’t attempt to avoid Fran’s strike despite the boost to his agility. In fact, he willingly facetanked it while roaring and throwing out a counter.</p>
<p>Only then did I finally come to understand his strategy. It was perfectly fine for him to take a fatal hit given that he had a Sacrificial Bracelet. His Nullified Sense of Pain allowed him to take advantage of the instant he tanked Fran's attack. Specifically, it allowed him to retaliate regardless of all other factors.</p>
<p>It was a strategy that didn’t sound too bad given how the tournament worked. It didn’t matter how injured he got. He’d end up getting healed by the tourney’s staff so long as he didn’t die. Pushing himself to the very edge of death would make it possible for him to defeat foes whose stats were higher than his own.</p>
<p>「Gah!」</p>
<p>「Still slow.」</p>
<p>But it didn’t work.</p>
<p>Fran warded off the blade he thrust at her by smacking its side with her palm and throwing it off course, an action only made possible by the fact that she could track his sword with pinpoint accuracy.</p>
<p>And then she kicked him, right in the cut she’d given him earlier. It was an attack that he simply couldn’t possibly have dodged. He was too far off balance, not that he could actually keep up with her to begin with.</p>
<p>All the air was sucked out of his lungs; he wasn’t even so much as able to scream as he was sent rolling off the stage. He stayed on the floor even after getting sent out of the arena; it looked like he’d lost consciousness.</p>
<p>「And that’s game! The winner is Fran, the Magic Sword Girl! She’s managed to triumph through not only the first, but also the second round despite all the adverse rumours and speculation!」</p>
<p>Apparently the crowd had thought that Kurusu was more likely to win, which, to be honest, wasn’t all that unexpected given that he’d been a C ranker for much longer than we had.</p>
<p>「Kurusu had attempted to apply the same suicidal strategy he’d used in the first round, but this time, his sword fell short! What a shame! It looked so close too!」</p>

		<p><b>Vs. Colbert<br>
</b><br>
Two days passed in the blink of an eye. Fran and I found ourselves staring the third round in the face before we knew it.</p>
<p>We were up against Colbert, the exact person that we'd been expecting to have to fight. We'd known that our confrontation with him was coming for a long while already, but I ended up feeling a bit nervous regardless. It wasn't something I could really help.</p>
<p>Fran, on the other hand, was calm and serene, seemingly in part because she was currently engaging in meditation, specifically zen meditation. I'd been the one that taught her the concept, but honestly, I barely knew anything about it myself. My knowledge of Zazen pretty much did nothing but scratch the surface. I was only able to tell her the concept and the fact that it involved closing her eyes and concentrating. She really seemed to like the idea, so she’d more or less figured the rest out all on her own.</p>
<p>Her current session had spanned just over ten minutes. Urushi hadn't wanted to disturb her, so he ended up laying down beside her instead of attempting to warm up as he had while waiting for the tourney's second round.</p>
<p>It seemed that the opponent Goldalfa faced in the third round was much stronger than the ones he'd faced in the first two, as he hadn't actually done his usual thing and won the round in a matter of moments. We would've had to leave the room basically immediately after entering it if he had. We instead had to wait for about another five minutes before finally begin called for.</p>
<p>「Good morning. It’s time for your match. Please follow me, I’ll lead you to the arena.」</p>
<p>Fran’s eyes shot open the moment the clerk said her name.</p>
<p>「Go time.」</p>
<p>Her lips curved into a smile as she got back onto her feet.</p>
<p>She didn’t seem to be even the slightest bit nervous, nor did it seem like she'd be off because she was way too hyped up.</p>
<p>Today, Fran was in perfect condition.</p>
<p>（Master, will go all out this time.）</p>
<p>『Want me to start helping off right off the bat?』</p>
<p>（Nn. Will try to go for quick win.）</p>
<p>Like most battle maniacs, Fran normally tended to prefer a bit of a more wait-and-see type attitude, but today, she decided that it would be best to go full throttle right off the bat. Her decision to treat this battle differently from all the ones that preceded it was one I agreed with.</p>
<p>That tendency to allow one's opponent to go all out wasn't what I'd call wise. We couldn’t really afford cutting our opponent any slack given that we had to live up to the Beast Lord’s expectations if we wanted him to actually bother speaking to us, especially because said opponent happened to be Colbert.</p>
<p>Another factor that played into her shift in attitude was that she no longer had to worry about antagonizing the Beast Lord. The possibility of him attacking us had basically been shrunk all the way down to zero, so we wouldn't need to pull our punches nor keep a few trump cards in reserve just because he was watching.</p>
<p>Fran passed through the usual dark corridor and entered the ring, only to be greeted with cheers and shouts even louder and more passionate than the ones she’d heard just two days prior.</p>
<p>「And there she is! Our first contestant today is the girl that’s overwhelmed both the opponents she’s fought so far despite all expectations, a Black Catkin, Fran! I can’t wait to see just how far her strength can take her!」</p>
<p>Colbert had yet to arrive, but the crowd had started to roar regardless.</p>
<p>The screams directed towards Fran could be split into three main groups. The first, were the angry folk that’d bet on her opponents in the first and or second round. The next type cheered in a much higher pitch, and seemed, in general, to have taken a liking to Fran because of how cute she was. The final group was a bit different from both of the first two and mainly consisted of adventurers.</p>
<p>At first, I was a bit surprised that there were so many of them rooting for us, but I soon realized that they were mostly members of Erza’s faction. I kind of suspected that he’d probably ordered them to cheer for us, as the extent of their motivation almost seemed a bit unnatural. I apparently wasn’t the only one to feel that way, as many of the other guests also seemed a bit shocked.</p>
<p>Seeing the crowd caused Fran to recoil a bit in embarrassment, but she still seemed kinda happy they were cheering for her regardless. The audience as a whole immediately reacted to her bashful attitude by getting even rowdier. It seemed she was really popular.</p>
<p>Even so, the noise was soon overwhelmed by a series of hollars that matched the one that’d first greeted her when she entered the ring.</p>
<p>「And there's her opponent! This round’s second contestant is no less popular than the first. Ladies and gentlemen, I present you a man known for using nothing but his fists to defeat even the most powerful of foes, B ranked adventurer, Iron Claw Colbert!」</p>
<p>I appraised Colbert and confirmed that his stats were basically the same as what they’d been back when we met him in Barbra… which meant basically nothing given that the stats that showed weren’t actually his real stats.</p>
<p>「Hello Fran. I can’t say I was expecting to see anyone else.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Colbert too.」</p>
<p>「Hahahah. As a B ranker, I won’t lose that easily, especially not to anyone weaker than me.」</p>
<p>「Including me?」</p>
<p>「Well, I don’t think you’re any weaker than I am… but I will have to win anyway if I want to keep face.」</p>
<p>「Can’t lose.」</p>
<p>「I feel the same.」</p>
<p>Sparks almost seemed to fly as the two narrowed their eyes and looked at each other. The fighting spirit that emanating off their bodies expanded through the entire venue and shrouded it with an intense pressure powerful enough to silence the crowd. The spectators instead gulped as they observed the tense atmosphere that'd broke out between the two warriors.</p>
<p>「Let the third round’s second match… begin!」</p>
<p>「Now come.」</p>
<p>Colbert was doing what we expected. He took on the typical wait-and-see type approach, not because he was going easy on us, but because he was confident he could handle anything we threw at him.</p>
<p>We, on the other hand, had already turned the dial to 11.</p>

        </div>
        
<p>『Stone Wall』<br>
『Fire Wall』<br>
『Wind Wall』</p>
<p>The three spells I casted worked to form a sort of tunnel around Fran and Colbert.</p>
<p>He immediately tried smashing the it's ceiling in order to escape, but he was too late. The fact that he allowed us to take the initiative meant we were already a full step in front of him.</p>
<p>「Inferno Burst」<br>
『Inferno Burst』</p>
<p>Both Fran and I immediately cast a flame-based spell and flooded the tunnel with fire before Colbert could escape it. The attack’s heat was so intense that it caused the stone we created to start melting, but it didn’t collapse right away. The flame and wind walls supported it and managed to keep it standing for a few seconds by regulating its temperature.</p>
<p>In other words, the other two walls attempted to feed heat back into the interior as opposed to allowing it to leak outside, which in turn meant that it ended up not only trapping Colbert, but also providing a bit of a boost to our Inferno Bursts'.</p>
<p>We knew our attack was a fairly sound one, but we didn’t let up. We trusted that Colbert was too strong to fall to just that, and so, we threw in a follow up.</p>
<p>「Wind Bullet!」<br>
『Stun Bullet』</p>
<p>All the smoke and flames made it so we couldn't actually see him, but that didn't matter. We simply shot where we felt his presence in order to pin him down and keep him from moving.</p>
<p>Only then did we finally throw in an attack that was actually meant to inflict some more serious harm.</p>
<p>「Haaaaah!」</p>
<p>『Let’s do this!』</p>
<p>The next attack was one I hadn’t had a chance to use in quite a while, my ever so reliable Telekinetic Catapult. The arena was a bit too small for me to reach my full speed, but I still flew at him incredibly quickly nonetheless.</p>
<p>I was confident that not even Colbert would be able to avoid the strike without sustaining a significant injury.</p>
<p>「Nragh!」</p>
<p>『Woah!』</p>
<p>But I was wrong.</p>
<p>A mana-covered fist approached from my side right before I managed to pierce him, one that contained so much force that it seemed like it would send me flying into orbit.</p>
<p>His counter made me realize that he was much more dangerous than I'd been expecting. He was skilled enough to easily knock aside the attack I planned to finish him off with, and basically hadn't taken any damage from our prior bombardment. The only thing that'd even gotten the slightest bit burnt was his clothing.</p>
<p>We had to defeat him before he actually got serious.</p>
<p>I hit the brakes as hard as I could by using telekinesis and wind magic while also making myself as spiky as a porcupine and cloaking myself in lightning.</p>
<p>「What!?」</p>
<p>Colbert’s voice rose in shock. Never in his wildest dreams had he ever envisioned that the sword he readied himself to hit would stop in place and transform.</p>
<p>His defenses were ridiculous. My needles, which were capable of tearing metal armour to bits, failed to pierce his skin. However, he didn't remain unharmed. He was assaulted by the lightning I’d wrapped around myself nonetheless.</p>
<p>「Gugagagagargghh!」</p>
<p>「Stun Bolt!」</p>
<p>Fran followed up my attack by throwing another lightning-based spell at him.</p>
<p>The two potent electrical energies shot throughout his body and caused sparks to erupt all over it.</p>
<p>「Finishing blow! Gale Hazard!」</p>
<p>Fran’s finisher, a blast of wind magic, evidenced that she wanted to end the match without having to engage in melee combat. She didn’t want him pulling off what Kurusu tried, and turning everything around at the last second.</p>
<p>Colbert was sent flying over 20 meters. It looked like he’d ring out and crash into the audience.<br>
Fran stayed vigilant, she carefully watched as he flew so she could prevent him from recovering with magic should he try it.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>「Mmph.」</p>
<p>『Did he just use a Feather of Teleportation?』</p>
<p>Colbert suddenly disappeared. I immediately recognized that he’d teleported, but couldn’t figure out where he went. I wasn’t able to find him by scanning the stage.</p>
<p>「Above.」</p>
<p>『He took to the sky!?』</p>
<p>Fran immediately caught onto the fact that Colbert had chosen to teleport way above the arena. His decision was a solid one that made good use of the item he'd employed. Gaining airtime allowed him to not only avoid losing but also respace himself. The only thing he had to really worry about was how he was going to land.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t without its demerits. Hanging around in the air basically made him a sitting duck given that Fran had an abundant amount of long ranged attacks.</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>She took aim and bombarded him with a whole slew of spells. Specifically, she’d chosen wind-based ones that prioritized max range over power.</p>
<p>I matched her attacks by throwing out several flame-based spells. The wind-based ones functioned as visual clutter and prevented them from being seen, which worked quite well, as they were powerful enough to instantly end the match.</p>
<p>But again, I was hoping for too much.</p>
<p>Colbert tore every single last one of our spells apart with his fists the moment before they hit him.</p>
<p>He then changed his direction midair with a burst of Qi and oriented himself so he was facing Fran.</p>
<p>「Hraaaaaghhhh!」</p>
<p>An incredible amount of magical energy suddenly began emanating from his body. The martial artist swung his fists through the air. Each movement, each punch, was accompanied by a blast of Qi that headed straight for Fran.</p>
<p>The individual Qi based projectiles were rather weak, but they were threatening nonetheless due to their sheer quantity; Fran was forced to respond by blasting them out of the sky with a few techniques of her own.</p>
<p>Still, they’d accomplished their job. They bought Colbert enough time to land.</p>
<p>He took a guarded stance with an evident lack of openings the moment his feet touched the ground before turning towards Fran and narrowing his eyes.</p>
<p>Likewise, she raised me and matched his glare with her own.</p>
<p>「Fuh. You sure are impatient, trying to end the match right away like that.」</p>
<p>「Was just taking advantage of opening.」</p>
